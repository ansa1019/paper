lodging lodging includes hotel accommodations and alternative accommodations. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2021, lodging accounted for 75%. as a result of the impact on travel demand from the covid-19 outbreak, room nights grew 35% in 2021 as compared to a decline 55% in 2020 and a growth of 11% in 2019. the timing of recovery in consumer sentiment on travel and on staying at hotels will be a factor in our level of room night growth, and as noted above, we expect that to vary by country. adrs for rooms booked on expedia group websites decreased 1% in 2019, increased 3% in 2020, and increased 20% in 2021. during 2021 and 2020, the increase in adrs for our vrbo business remained elevated compared to years prior to the covid-19 outbreak. vrbo carries a higher adr than hotels and has accounted for a higher percentage of room nights due to the faster recovery and shift to alternative accommodations during these periods.
the uncertain environment as a result of covid-19, including travel restrictions and shifts in consumer behavior, the mix of our lodging bookings across geographies and types of accommodations, and general variability in supply and demand, make it difficult to predict adr trends in the near-term.

table of contents as of december 31, 2021, our global lodging marketplace had approximately 3 million lodging properties available, including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings and approximately 875,000 hotels.
hotel. we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations (stand-alone and package bookings). after rolling out etp globally over a period of several years, during which time we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs, our relationships and overall economics with hotel supply partners have been broadly stable in recent years. as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering, in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions. these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth. additionally, increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night and profitability.
since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis, any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night. over the course of the last several years, occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry generally increased on a currency-neutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment. however, due to covid-19, current occupancy rates for hotels in the united states are at reduced levels. in addition, other factors could pressure adr trends, including the continued growth in hotel supply in recent years and the increase in alternative accommodation inventory. further, while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented, there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups. in the meantime, certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on third-party websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points, increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wi-fi.
alternative accommodations. with our acquisition of vrbo (previously homeaway) and all of its brands in december
2015, we expanded into the fast growing alternative accommodations market. vrbo is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia group. vrbo has transitioned from a listings-based classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners, with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology. vrbo offers hosts subscription-based listing or pay-per-booking service models. it also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings. in addition, we have actively moved to integrate vrbo listings into our global retail services, as well as directly add alternative accommodation listings to our offerings, to position our key global brands to offer a full range of lodging options for consumers.
air the airline industry has been dramatically impacted by covid-19. as a result of the significantly reduced air travel demand due to government travel restrictions and the impact on consumer sentiment related to covid-19, airlines have been operating with less capacity and passenger traffic has declined significantly. while we experienced some improvement in air bookings during 2021 versus 2020, it continues to lag lodging bookings and is still meaningfully below 2019 levels. the recovery in air travel remains difficult to predict, and may not correlate with the recovery in lodging demand. according to the transportation security administration ("tsa"), air traveler 7-day average throughput declined 95% in april 2020 compared to prior year levels. the declines moderated to approximately 50% by the end of 2020, and further improved in 2021 with throughput down approximately 20% at the end of the year, compared to 2019 levels.
in addition, there is significant correlation between airline revenue and fuel prices, and fluctuations in fuel prices generally take time to be reflected in air revenue. given current volatility, it is uncertain how fuel prices could impact airfares. we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine, certain supply agreements renew, and as we continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets.
air ticket volumes increased 7% in 2019, declined 63% in 2020, and increased 43% during 2021. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2021, air accounted for 3%.
advertising & media our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago, a leading hotel metasearch website, and expedia group media solutions, which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands. in 2021, we generated $603 million of advertising and media revenue, a 49%
increase from 2020, representing 7% of our total worldwide revenue. given the decline in travel demand related to covid-19, online travel agencies dramatically reduced marketing spend, including on trivago, and given the uncertain duration and impact of covid-19 it is difficult to predict when spend will recover to normalized levels.
in response, in 2020, trivago significantly reduced its marketing spend and took additional actions to lower operating expenses, which continued throughout 2021. we expect trivago to continue to experience pressure on revenue and profit until online travel agencies and other hotel suppliers see consumer demand that warrants increasing in their advertising spend with trivago.
32
table of contents seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. for example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. since revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. historically, vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. furthermore, operating profits for our primary advertising business, trivago, have typically been experienced in the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring, summer and winter holiday travel. as a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. the growth of our international operations, advertising business or a change in our product mix, including the growth of vrbo, may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future.
impacts from covid-19 disrupted our typical seasonal pattern for bookings, revenue, profit and cash flows during
2020 and 2021. significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes, particularly in the first half of
2020, resulted in material operating losses and negative cash flow. although travel volumes remain materially lower than historic levels, booking and travel trends improved during the second half of 2020, and in 2021. this resulted in working capital benefits and positive cash flow more akin to typical historical trends. it remains difficult to forecast the seasonality for the upcoming quarters, given the uncertainty related to the duration of the impact from covid-19 and the shape and timing of any sustained recovery.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. we base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:
• it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and
• changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
for more information on each of these policies, see note 2 - significant accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below.
accounting for certain merchant revenue we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience. actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior.
deferred loyalty rewards we currently offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our travelers, such as our hotels.com rewards program, our expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program. hotels.com rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions. expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on various brand expedia websites. orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks, the currency of orbitz rewards, on flights, hotels and vacation
33
table of contents packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. in 2021, we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform spanning all products and global brands. as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques.
revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points, that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in reward value, product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets goodwill . we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. during 2020, as a result of the significant turmoil related to covid-19, we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform multiple interim impairment assessments. in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and, if applicable, record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired.
we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units, except for trivago, which is a separately listed company on the nasdaq global select market, on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary, which is based on market valuation. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. the fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago's stock price, a level 1 input, adjusted for an estimated control premium.
we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.
in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company's total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.
indefinite-lived intangible assets . we base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.
definite-lived intangible assets. we review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets
34
table of contents over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in an impairment or, in the period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge.
for additional information on our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2021 and 2020, see note 3 -
fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes we record income taxes under the liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense.
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.
we account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria. the first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority, including resolution of any appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. if the tax position meets the more likely than not criteria, the portion of the tax benefit greater than
50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements. the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.
other long-term liabilities various legal and tax contingencies . we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities. in addition, we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss. in addition, our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel. the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.
occupancy and other taxes . some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. generally, hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. when a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. in most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator, on the portion of the customer payment we retain. some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard.
while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes. a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against certain of our companies for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on our services. we are an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting an alternative accommodations property and we believe are similarly not liable for such taxes. we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments, including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments, prior to contesting any such assessments.
35
table of contents we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes.
we note that there are more than 10,000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states, and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction. rather, we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue. many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce. certain jurisdictions have enacted, and others may enact, legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that facilitate the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations. we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level of reserves, as developments warrant.
additionally, certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation, which is discussed in part i, item
3, legal proceedings.
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see note 2 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
occupancy and other taxes we are currently involved in eight lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes. we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. with respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes and/or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide, namely the facilitation of travel planning and reservations, and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations.
for additional information and other recent developments on these and other legal proceedings, see part i, item 3, legal proceedings.
we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $50 million as of december 31, 2021 and $58 million as of december 31, 2020.
certain jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of new york, new jersey, north carolina, minnesota, oregon, rhode island, maryland, pennsylvania, hawaii, iowa, massachusetts, arizona, wisconsin, idaho, arkansas, indiana, maine, nebraska, vermont, mississippi, virginia, the city of new york, and the district of columbia, have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel and/or other accommodations and/or car rental. in addition, in certain jurisdictions, we have entered into voluntary collection agreements pursuant to which we have agreed to voluntarily collect and remit taxes to state and/or local taxing jurisdictions. we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of new york, new jersey, south carolina, north carolina, minnesota, georgia, wyoming, west virginia, oregon, rhode island, montana, maryland, kentucky, maine, pennsylvania, hawaii, iowa, massachusetts, arizona, wisconsin, idaho, arkansas, indiana, nebraska, vermont, colorado, mississippi, virginia, the city of new york and the district of columbia, as well as certain other jurisdictions.
pay-to-play certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as "pay-to-
play." payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. if we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. however, any significant pay-to-play payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity.
other jurisdictions. we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities, some of which, including the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes, may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.

table of contents segments we have the following reportable segments: retail, b2b, and trivago. our retail segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including:
expedia.com and hotels.com in the united states and localized expedia and hotels.com websites throughout the world, vrbo, orbitz, travelocity, wotif group, ebookers, cheaptickets, hotwire.com, carrentals.com and expedia cruises.
our b2b segment is comprised of our expedia business services organization including expedia partner solutions, which offers private label and co-branded products to make travel services available to travelers through third-
party company branded websites, and, through its sale in november 2021, egencia, a full-service travel management company that provides travel services to businesses and their corporate customers. our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites.
operating metrics our operating results are affected by certain metrics, such as gross bookings and revenue margin, which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us. gross bookings generally represent the total retail value of transactions booked for agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are reduced for cancellations and refunds. revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.

(1) trivago, which is comprised of a hotel metasearch business that differs from our transaction-based websites, does not have associated gross bookings or revenue margin. however, third-party revenue from trivago is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin.
the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2021 compared to 2020 reflected improvements in the travel environment.
revenue margin in 2021 was lower than 2020 due in part to significant lodging cancellations in the prior year period, which reduced gross bookings, creating an unusual mix of bookings and revenue.

lodging revenue increased 59% in 2021 on a 35% increase in room nights stayed and an 18% increase in revenue per room night across hotel and alternative accommodations. revenue per room night in 2021 benefited from higher adrs driven by an increase in regional rates and a higher mix of u.s. hotels.
air revenue increased 141% in 2021 driven by an increase in air tickets sold of 43% as air travel demand improved as well as the prior year impact of certain significant covid-19 related accruals that did not repeat in 2021.
advertising and media revenue increased 49% in 2021 due to increases at both trivago and expedia group media solutions. all other revenue, which includes car rental, insurance, destination services, fee revenue related to our corporate travel business (through egencia's sale in november 2021) and bodybuilding.com (through its sale in may 2020), increased 103% in 2021 from growth in travel insurance products as well as car.
in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion, our revenue by business model is as follows:

the increase in merchant revenue in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in merchant hotel revenue driven by an increase in room nights stayed, an increase in vrbo merchant alternative accommodations revenue and the growth in travel insurance products.
the increase in agency revenue in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in agency hotel, car and air revenue.
advertising, media and other increased 12% in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by declines related to our prior year sale of bodybuilding.com and certain miscellaneous other declines.
in the below discussion, we reclassified certain prior period information to conform to the current period presentation primarily related to the classification of licensing and maintenance costs within our operating expenses. these prior period reclassifications did not alter our discussion of year over year comparisons between
2020 and 2019, which can be referenced in our 2020 form 10-k. for additional information, see note 2 - significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

cost of revenue primarily consists of direct costs to support our customer operations, including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors; credit card processing, including merchant fees, fraud and chargebacks; and other costs, primarily including data center and cloud costs to support our websites, supplier operations, destination supply, certain transactional level taxes, costs related to bodybuilding.com during our period of ownership as well as related personnel and overhead costs, including stock-
based compensation.
cost of revenue decreased $127 million during 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense, which was significantly elevated in 2020 due to the initial impacts of covid-19, decreased customer service and personnel costs, and the absence of expenses related to bodybuilding.com, which was disposed of in the second quarter of 2020. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in merchant fees resulting from recovering transaction volumes.

amortization depreciation decreased $24 million in 2021 compared to 2020. amortization of intangible assets decreased $55
million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets or sold entities as well as the impact of definite-lived intangible impairments in the prior year.
impairment of goodwill, intangible and other long-term assets during 2021, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14 million and intangible and other long-term asset impairment charges of $6 million related to our b2b segment. during 2020, as a result of the significant negative impact related to covid-19, which has had a severe effect on the entire global travel industry, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $799 million as well as intangible asset impairment charges of $175 million. see note 3 - fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

legal reserves, occupancy tax and other for year ended december 31, 2021 included a charge for certain other legal reserves, mostly offset by net reductions to our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes. during 2020, we recorded a $25 million gain in relation to a legal settlement, which was partially offset by changes in our reserves related to occupancy and other matters.
restructuring and related reorganization charges in 2020, we committed to restructuring actions intended to simplify our businesses and improve operational efficiencies, which have resulted in headcount reductions and office consolidations. as a result, we recognized $55
million and $231 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2021 and 2020. we continue to actively evaluate additional cost reduction efforts and should we make decisions in future periods to take further actions we may incur additional reorganization charges.

adjusted ebitda is our primary segment operating metric. see note 19 - segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on intersegment transactions, unallocated overhead costs and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda by segment to net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. for the periods presented above. during the fourth quarter of 2021, we consolidated our divisional finance teams into one global finance organization, which resulted in the reclassification of expenses from retail and b2b into our corporate function. we have reclassified prior period segment information to conform to our current period presentation.
our retail, b2b and trivago segments all experienced improvements in adjusted ebitda in 2021 as a result of the recovering travel environment as well as impacts of the costs saving initiatives implemented in 2020.
our retail, b2b and trivago segment adjusted ebitda significantly declined during 2020, compared to 2019, resulting from impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, which drove meaningful revenue declines, partially offset by a decline in direct sales and marketing expense as a percent of revenue. unallocated overhead costs decreased $130 million during 2020 primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses.

we are subject to taxation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions. our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. during the fourth quarter of 2019, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to
2013 tax years. the proposed adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by $696 million, which would result in federal tax of approximately $244 million, subject to interest. we do not agree with the position of the irs. we filed a protest with the irs for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and appeals returned our case to exam for further review. we are also under examination by the irs for our 2014 to 2016 tax years. subsequent years remain open to examination by the irs. we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years.
for additional information, see note 10 - income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. we
41
table of contents endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-gaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-gaap measure.
adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above, in the legal proceedings section, as well as the notes to the financial statements. the non-gaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. adjusted for (1) net income
(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net;
(4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans;
(5) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, if any, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree, if any; (6)
certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other; (8)
that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation.
the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. in addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-
based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. to adjusted ebitda is as follows:

31, 2021 and 2020.
as of december 31, 2021, the total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the united states was $676 million ($375 million in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and $301 million in majority-owned subsidiaries). the amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the unites states, and for which future distributions could be taxable, was $69 million as of

managing our balance sheet prudently and maintaining appropriate liquidity have been high priorities during the covid-19 pandemic. in 2020, in order to best position the company to navigate our temporary working capital changes and depressed revenue, we took a number of actions to bolster our liquidity and preserve financial flexibility. in
2021, we continued certain of these actions, including suspension of our share repurchases and quarterly common stock dividends, but, with an improvement in market condition and trends in the current year, we were able to complete the following actions to reduce our cost of capital:
• 0% convertible notes issuance. in february 2021, we completed our private placement of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the "convertible notes"). the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes was approximately $983 million after deducting debt issuance costs. the convertible notes will mature on february 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. the convertible notes will not bear regular interest. the convertible notes have an initial conversion rate of 3.9212
shares of common stock of expedia group with a par value $0.0001 per share, per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $255.02 per share of our common stock. the conversion rate is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to, the issuance of stock dividends and payment of cash dividends.
• 2.95% senior notes issuance. in march 2021, we privately placed $1 billion of senior unsecured notes that are due in march 2031 that bear interest at 2.95% (the "2.95% notes"). the 2.95% notes were issued at a price of 99.081% of the aggregate principal amount. interest is payable semi-annually in arrears in march and september of each year, beginning september 15, 2021, and the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on certain ratings events. the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2.95% notes was approximately $982 million after deducting the discount and debt issuance costs.
• extinguishment of high cost debt. in march 2021, we used the net proceeds from the convertible notes and 2.95%
notes and completed the redemption of all of our outstanding 7.0% notes as well as settled the tender offer to purchase $956 million in aggregate principal of our 6.25% notes, which resulted in the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of $280 million in 2021 comprised of early payment premiums and fees associated with the tender offer as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
• repayment of preferred stock . in may 2021, we completed the prepayment of 50% of the outstanding series a preferred stock at a price equal to 103% of the preference amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions as to the redemption dates using cash on-hand. in october 2021, we prepaid the remaining 50% of the outstanding series a preferred stock under the same terms as the may prepayment using cash on-hand.
on february 1, 2022, notice was provided to the holders of the company's 2.5% notes due 2022 that the company will redeem all of the €650 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes on march 3, 2022. the redemption price for the notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date.
our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. as of december 31, 2021, moody's rating was baa3
with an outlook of "stable," s&p's rating was bbb- with an outlook of "stable" and fitch's rating was bbb- with an outlook of "negative." changes in our operating results, cash flows, financial position, capital structure, financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase, dividends, investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow and/or limited access to capital markets and interest rates on the 6.25% notes issued in may
2020, the 3.6% and 4.625% notes issued in july 2020 as well as the 2.95% notes issued in march 2021 will increase, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt as detailed in note 7 - debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction. for most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant lodging business, we generally pay after the travelers' use and, in some cases, subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers. therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. typically, the seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings have affected the timing of our annual cash flows. generally, during the first half of the year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. during the second half of the year, this pattern typically reverses and cash flows are typically negative. during 2020, impacts of covid-19 disrupted our typical working
43
table of contents capital trends. significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes, particularly in the first half of
2020, resulted in material operating losses and negative cash flow. although travel volumes remain materially lower than historic levels, booking and travel trends normalized during the second half of 2020, and during 2021 have increased from 2020 levels, resulting in working capital benefits and positive cash flow in the current period more akin to typical historical trends. however, it remains difficult to forecast the working capital trends for the upcoming quarters, given the uncertainty related to the duration of the impact from covid-19 and the shape and timing of any sustained recovery.
prior to covid-19, we embarked on an ambitious cost reduction initiative to simplify the organization and increase efficiency. in response to covid-19, we took several additional actions to further reduce costs to help mitigate the financial impact from covid-19 and continue to improve our long-term cost structure. in addition, certain capital expenditures were deferred in 2020, including temporarily halting construction on several real estate projects. in 2021, as economic conditions improved, we substantially completed the construction of our new headquarters and the project was within the expected total project spend of approximately $900 million. for 2022, we expect total capital expenditures for the full year to increase over 2021 spending levels.
our cash flows are as follows:

on cash and cash equivalents in 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.7 billion compared to cash used in operating activities of $3.8 billion for 2020. in the prior year period, impacts from the covid-19 pandemic resulted in a significant use of cash to fund working capital changes and operating losses compared to a current year cash benefit from working capital. the largest driver of the swing in working capital relates to a significant use of cash in the prior year for deferred merchant bookings as refunds for cancelled bookings exceeded new bookings compared to a meaningful increase in booking volumes and deferred merchant bookings in the current year period.
in 2021, $668 million more cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net purchase of investments of
$178 million in 2021 compared to net sales and maturities of investments of $476 million in 2020, partially offset by lower capital expenditures, including those related to our new headquarters as our construction winds down.
cash used in financing activities in 2021 primarily included payments of approximately $2 billion related to the extinguishment of debt and $1.2 billion for the redemption of preferred stock both discussed above as well as $165
million of cash paid for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments and $67 million in preferred stock dividends. these uses of cash were largely offset by approximately $2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and 2.95% notes issued in february and march 2021, respectively, as well as $503
million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily included $3.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in may and july 2020, $1.1 billion of net proceeds from our private equity issuance, as well as $319 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. these sources of cash were partially offset by the august 2020 repayment of $750 million of 5.95% notes, cash paid to acquire shares of $425 million, including the repurchased shares in the first quarter of 2020 and treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments, and cash dividend payments of $123 million.
our board of directors, or the executive committee, acting on behalf of the board of directors, have authorized share repurchases under authorized programs. as disclosed above, these programs were temporarily halted in early
2020 but repurchases prior to that time were as follows:

table of contents as of december 31, 2021, there were approximately 23.3 million shares remaining under prior repurchase authorizations. there is no fixed termination date for the repurchases.
during 2021, while we didn't pay common stock dividends, we did pay $67 million (or $74.96 per share of series a preferred stock) of dividends on the series a preferred stock. during 2020, the total dividend payment of $123
million included a common stock dividend of $0.34 per share for the first quarter of 2020 as well as $75 million
(or $62.47 per share of series a preferred stock) of dividends on the series a preferred stock. at this time, we do not expect to make future quarterly dividend payments on our common stock. future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors.
foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a decrease of our cash and restricted cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2021 of $177 million reflecting a net depreciation in foreign currencies relative to the u.s.
dollar during the year. foreign exchange rate changes resulted in increases of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2020 of $61 million, reflecting a net appreciation in foreign currencies relative to the u.s.
dollar during the year.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments. our material cash requirements as of december 31, 2021 include the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising in the normal course of business:
• principal payments related to our debt that is included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments. the company had senior notes and convertible notes, as described in note 7 - debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, with varying maturities and an aggregate principal amount of
$8.5 billion, with $735 million payable within 12 months. based on current stated fixed rates and current exchange rates, if applicable, future interest payments associated with the senior notes total approximately $1.6 billion, with approximately $304 million payable within 12 months;
• our operating leases had fixed lease payment obligations, including imputed interest, of $504 million, with $91
million payable within 12 months; and
• purchase obligations representing the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners. these minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods, and payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use. the company had purchase obligations of $824 million, with $589 million payable within 12 months.
in addition, we had $275 million of net unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31,
2021, for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment.
see note 15 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our purchase obligations as well as amounts outstanding as of december 31, 2021 related to letters of credit and guarantees. other than the items described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2021.
in our opinion, our liquidity position provides sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable cash needs.
there can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, including refinancings, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us.

part ii. item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices.
our exposure to market risk includes our long-term debt, our revolving credit facilities, derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables, investments, merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies. we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures. our objective is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
interest rate risk in august 2014, we issued $500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 4.5%. in june 2015, we issued euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 2.5%. (see "foreign exchange risk" below for further discussion or our 2.5% notes.) in december 2015, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 5.0%. in september 2017, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 3.8%. in september 2019, we issued $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 3.25%. in may 2020, we issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes due may 2025 that bear interest at 6.25%, of which $956 million in aggregate principal was subsequently repaid in 2021. in july 2020, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes due december 2023 that bear interest at 3.6% and $750 million of senior unsecured notes due august 2027 that bear interest at 4.625%. in march 2021, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes due march 2031 that bear interest at 2.95%. the 2.5%, 3.6%, 4.5%, 6.25%, 5.0%, 4.625%, 3.8%, 3.25%, and 2.95% senior unsecured notes are collectively the "senior notes." in february 2021, we issued $1 billion of convertible senior unsecured notes due february 2026
with a fixed rate of 0% (the "convertible notes"). as a result, if market interest rates decline, our required payments will exceed those based on market rates. additionally, the senior unsecured notes issued in may and july
2020, and march 2021 are subject to interest rate adjustments should our credit ratings be adjusted downwards, which would result in increased interest expense in the future. the total estimated fair value of our senior notes and convertible notes was approximately $9.2 billion and $9.1 billion as of december 31, 2021 and december 31,
2020. the fair value was determined based on quoted market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes by approximately $200 million.
we maintain revolving credit facilities of $2 billion, which bear interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings. because our interest rate is tied to a market rate, we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if, consistent with our practice to date, we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. we had no revolving credit facilities borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020.

table of contents foreign exchange risk we conduct business in certain international markets, primarily in australia, canada, china, the united kingdom, and the european union. because we operate in international markets, we have exposure to different economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates. our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in u.s.
dollars. changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses, which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations.
to the extent practicable, we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies. additionally, we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. these instruments are typically short-term and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other, net. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a net forward asset of $3 million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a net forward liability of $14 million included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively. we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds, customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies. in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results, we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges.
in june 2015, we issued euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 2.5%. the aggregate principal value of the 2.5% notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries. the notes are measured at euro to u.s. dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). the euro-denominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars at each balance sheet date, with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). since the notional amount of the recorded euro-denominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment, we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge.
future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the u.s. dollar, the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period, and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing, through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts, such exposures. as an example, if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10% against the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10% against the u.s. dollar, we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately $13 million based on our foreign currency forward positions (including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures) and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31, 2021. as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently, even daily, as do foreign exchange rates, the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period.
during 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $48 million ($37 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue), net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately $71 million ($2 million gain excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue) and net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $34 million ($34 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue). as we increase our operations in international markets, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases. the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. these changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies.

controls and procedures changes in internal control over financial reporting.
there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
as required by rule 13a-15(b) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), our management, including our chairman and senior executive, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rule 13a-15(e) under the exchange act). based upon that evaluation, our chairman and senior executive, chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rule 13a-15(f) of the exchange act. internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management has concluded that, as of december 31, 2021, the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. management has reviewed its assessment with the audit committee. ernst & young, llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, as stated in their report which is included below.
limitations on controls.
management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.

opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited expedia group, inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). in our opinion, expedia group, inc. (the company)
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated february
10, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of expedia group, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of expedia group, inc. (the company) as of december
31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at december 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework), and our report dated february 10, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
loyalty programs as discussed in note 2 of the financial statements, travelers enrolled in the expedia rewards and hotels.com rewards loyalty programs (collectively "loyalty programs") earn reward points with each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for free or discounted future bookings. member consideration is allocated between travel services and reward points earned in the loyalty programs. the company defers the relative standalone selling price of earned reward points, net description of the matter    of rewards not expected to be redeemed (known as "breakage"), as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. to estimate the relative standalone selling price for reward points, the company considers the stated redemption value per point dictated by the terms of the loyalty programs and then estimates the future breakage of reward points based on statistical modeling techniques using historical member activity. the deferred loyalty rewards balance, net of amounts paid to the travel suppler, is recognized as revenue when the travel service purchased with the loyalty reward is satisfied.
f- 2
table of contents auditing the company's deferred loyalty rewards balance is especially complex and judgmental due to significant measurement uncertainty in determining the expected future breakage of reward points. management uses statistical modeling techniques to estimate future breakage based on historical member activity. the amount of member consideration allocated to the reward points earned is sensitive to the expected future breakage assumption. changes in loyalty program terms or the method or manner in which reward points can be redeemed by members can change member behavior which increases the measurement uncertainty as historical member activity may not be indicative of future behavior.
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's review of the statistical modeling techniques and resulting breakage estimates.
we also tested controls over the completeness and accuracy of member activity data used in the breakage estimate analyses. this included controls over the company's systems and the application controls involved in the process to track loyalty reward member activity.
how we addressed the matter in our audit    to test the deferred loyalty rewards balance, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, involving our actuarial specialists to assist us in assessing the methods used by management and to develop an independent actuarial estimate of a reasonable range of breakage rates. we then compared this reasonable range of breakage rates to the company's estimates.
additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the member activity data used by our actuarial specialists in their breakage analyses.
deferred tax assets valuation allowance as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company records a valuation allowance based on the assessment of the realizability of the company's deferred tax assets. the company establishes a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized.   for the year ended december 31, 2021, the company description of the matter                   recorded deferred tax assets of $1,518 million and a related valuation allowance of $171 million.
auditing management's assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets is complex because management's projection of future taxable income includes forward-looking assumptions that are inherently judgmental because they may be affected by future market or other economic conditions.
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's review of the realizability of deferred tax assets. this included controls over management's evaluation of the sources of future taxable income.
we tested the assumptions used by the company to develop the anticipated future earnings used in the company's analysis in determining the valuation allowance. we tested the completeness and how we addressed the matter in our audit    accuracy of the underlying data used in the company's projections.
for example, we evaluated the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying the future projected financial information, as well as management's consideration of current operating, industry and economic trends. we also compared the projections of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the company. in addition, we evaluated the application of tax law in the projections of future taxable income.

notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 - organization and basis of presentation description of business expedia group, inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products and services to leisure and corporate travelers in the united states and abroad as well as various media and advertising offerings to travel and non-travel advertisers. these travel products and services are offered through a diversified portfolio of brands including:
brand expedia®, hotels.com®, expedia® partner solutions, vrbo®, trivago®, orbitz®, travelocity®, hotwire®, wotif®, ebookers®, cheaptickets®, expedia grouptm media solutions, carrentals.comtm, expedia cruises tm , and traveldoo®. in addition, many of these brands have related international points of sale. we refer to expedia group, inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as "expedia group," the "company," "us," "we" and "our" in these consolidated financial statements.
covid-19
the covid-19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world, had an unprecedented effect on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business, financial results and financial condition. since the first quarter of 2020, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have implemented, and continue to implement, a variety of containment measures, including travel restrictions, bans and advisories, instructions to practice social distancing, curfews, quarantine advisories, including quarantine restrictions after travel in certain locations, "shelter-in-place" orders, required closures of non-essential businesses, vaccination mandates or requirements for businesses to confirm employees' vaccination status, and other restrictions. while the process of vaccinating their residents against covid-19 is underway in many countries, with various levels of success, the large scale and challenging logistics of distributing the vaccines, the unavailability of vaccines in many regions, the impact of vaccine hesitancy, as well as uncertainty over the efficacy of the vaccine against new variants of the virus, may all contribute to delays in economic recovery, particularly for the travel industry. overall, the full duration and total impact of covid-19 remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict how the recovery will unfold for the travel industry and, in particular, our business, going forward.
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include expedia group, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities we control, or in which we have a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary of expected cash profits or losses. we record our investments in entities that we do not control, but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, using the equity method or at fair value. we have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts.
we believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements are reasonable. however, these consolidated financial statements do not present our future financial position, the results of our future operations and cash flows.
seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. for example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. since revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. historically, vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. furthermore, operating profits for our primary advertising business, trivago, have typically been experienced in the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring, summer and winter holiday travel. as a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. the growth of our international operations, advertising business or a change in our product mix, including the growth of vrbo, may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future.
impacts from covid-19 disrupted our typical seasonal pattern for bookings, revenue, profit and cash flows during
2020 and 2021. significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes, particularly in the first half of
2020, resulted in material operating losses and negative cash flow. although travel volumes remain materially lower than historic levels, booking and travel trends improved during the second half of 2020, and in 2021. this resulted in working capital benefits and positive f- 10
table of contents cash flow more akin to typical historical trends. it remains difficult to forecast the seasonality for the upcoming quarters, given the uncertainty related to the duration of the impact from covid-19 and the shape and timing of any sustained recovery.
note 2 - significant accounting policies consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of expedia group, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities for which we control a majority of the entity's outstanding common stock. we record non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements to recognize the minority ownership interest in our consolidated subsidiaries. non-controlling interest in the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners in our consolidated entities, which includes the non-
controlling interest share of net income or loss from our redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interest entities. trivago is a separately listed company on the nasdaq global select market and, therefore, is subject to its own reporting and filing requirements, which could result in possible differences that are not expected to be material to expedia group, inc.
we have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts in our consolidated financial statements.
accounting estimates we use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"). our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income or loss during any period. our actual financial results could differ significantly from these estimates. the significant estimates underlying our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition; recoverability of current and long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; income and transactional taxes, such as potential settlements related to occupancy and excise taxes; loss contingencies; deferred loyalty rewards; acquisition purchase price allocations; stock-based compensation and accounting for derivative instruments and provisions for credit losses, customer refunds and chargebacks.
the covid-19 pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions, which may cause further business disruptions and adversely impact our results of operations. as a result, many of our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility.
as events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future periods.
reclassifications we have reclassified prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. during the first quarter of 2021, we centralized the management of our licensing and maintenance costs and reclassified certain expenses to technology and content expense from within our other operating expense line items on our consolidated statements of operations. the following table presents a summary of the amounts as reported and as reclassified in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019:

administrative revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of our promised services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
for our primary transaction-based revenue sources, discussed below, we have determined net presentation (that is, the amount billed to a traveler less the amount paid to a supplier) is appropriate for the majority of our revenue transactions as the supplier is primarily responsible for providing the underlying travel services and we do not control the service provided by the supplier to the traveler. we exclude all taxes assessed by a government authority, if any, from the measurement of transaction f- 11
table of contents prices that are imposed on our travel related services or collected by the company from customers (which are therefore excluded from revenue).
we offer traditional travel services on a stand-alone and package basis generally either through the merchant or the agency business model.
under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms, alternative accommodations, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings.
under the agency model, we pass reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel supplier and the travel supplier serves as the merchant of record for such bookings. we receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier and/or traveler. for certain agency airline, hotel and car transactions, we also receive fees through global distribution systems ("gds") that provide the computer systems through which the travel supplier inventory is made available and through which reservations are booked.
under the advertising model, we offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on trivago and our transaction-based websites.
in addition, vrbo also provides subscription-based listing and other ancillary services to property owners and managers.
the nature of our travel booking service performance obligations vary based on the travel service with differences primarily related to the degree to which we provide post booking services to the traveler and the timing when rights and obligations are triggered in our underlying supplier agreements. we consider both the traveler and travel supplier as our customers.
refer to note 19 - segment information for revenue by business model and service type.
lodging. our lodging revenue is comprised of revenue recognized under the merchant, agency and vrbo subscription-
based listing services model.
merchant hotel. we provide travelers access to book hotel room reservations through our contracts with lodging suppliers, which provide us with rates and availability information for rooms but for which we have no control over the rooms and do not bear inventory risk. our travelers pay us for merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip, generally when they book the reservation. we record the payment in deferred merchant bookings until the stayed night occurs, at which point we recognize the revenue, net of amounts paid to suppliers, as this is when our performance obligation is satisfied. in certain nonrefundable, nonchangeable transactions where we have no significant post booking services (primarily opaque hotel offerings), we record revenue when the traveler completes the transaction on our website, less a reserve for chargebacks and cancellations based on historical experience.
payments to suppliers are generally due within 30 days of check-in or stay. in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience. cancellation fees are collected and remitted to the supplier, if applicable.
agency hotel. we generally record agency revenue from the hotel when the stayed night occurs as we provide post booking services to the traveler and, thus consider the stay as when our performance obligation is satisfied. we record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience.
merchant and agency vrbo alternative accommodations. vrbo's lodging revenue is generally earned on a pay-per-
booking basis, which can be either merchant or agency bookings depending on the nature of the payment processor.
pay-per-booking arrangements are commission-based where rental property owners and managers bear the inventory risk, have latitude in setting the price and compensate vrbo for facilitating bookings with travelers. under pay-
per-booking arrangements, each booking is a separate contract as listings are typically cancelable at any time and the related revenue, net of amounts paid to property owners, is recognized at check in, which is the point in time when our service to the traveler is complete. vrbo also charges a traveler service fee at the time of booking. the service fee charged to travelers provides compensation for vrbo's services, including but not limited to the use of vrbo's website and a "book with confidence guarantee" providing travelers with comprehensive payment protection and
24/7 traveler support. the performance obligation is to facilitate the booking of a property and assist travelers up to their check in process and, as such, the traveler service fee revenue is recognized at check-in.
subscription-based listing services. to a lesser extent, vrbo's lodging revenue is also earned on a pay-per-
subscription basis. in pay-per-subscription contracts, property owners or managers purchase in advance online advertising services related to the listing of their properties for rent over a fixed term (typically one year). as the performance obligation is the listing service and is provided to the property owner or manager over the life of the listing period, the pay-per-subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the listing period.
merchant and agency air. we record revenue on air transactions when the traveler books the transaction, as we do not typically provide significant post booking services to the traveler and payments due to and from air carriers are typically due at f- 12
table of contents the time of ticketing. we record a reserve for chargebacks and cancellations at the time of the transaction based on historical experience. in certain transactions, the gds collects commissions from our suppliers and passes these commissions to us, net of their fees. therefore, we view payments through the gds as commissions from suppliers and record these commissions in net revenue. fees paid to the gds as compensation for their role in processing transactions are recorded as cost of revenue.
advertising and media . we record revenue from click-through fees charged to our travel partners for leads sent to the travel partners' websites. we record revenue from click-through fees after the traveler makes the click-through to the related travel partners' websites. we record revenue for advertising placements ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of advertising impressions, depending on the terms of the contract. payments from advertisers are generally due within 30 days of invoicing.
other. other primarily includes transaction revenue for booking services related to products such as car, cruise and destination services under the agency business model. we generally record the related revenue when the travel occurs, as in most cases we provide post booking services and this is when our performance obligation is complete.
additionally, no rights or obligations are triggered in our supplier agreements until the travel occurs. we record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience. revenue from other ancillary alternative accommodation services or products are recorded either upon delivery or when we provide the service. in addition, other also includes travel insurance products primarily under the merchant model, for which revenue is recorded at the time the transaction is booked.
packages. packages assembled by travelers through the packaging functionality on our websites generally include a merchant hotel component and some combination of an air, car or destination services component. the individual package components are accounted for as separate performance obligations and recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies stated above.
prepaid merchant bookings. we classify payments made to suppliers in advance of vrbo performance obligations as prepaid merchant bookings included within prepaid and other current assets.prepaid merchant bookings was $
581million as of december 31, 2021 and $ 389million as of december 31, 2020.
deferred merchant bookings. we classify cash payments received in advance of our performance obligations as deferred merchant bookings.at december 31, 2020, $ 2.3billion of advance cash payments was reported within deferred merchant bookings, $ 1.7billion of which was recognized resulting in $ 301million of revenue during the year ended december 31, 2021 with the remainder primarily consisting of cancellations during the year. at december 31, 2021, the related balance was $ 4.9billion.
travelers enrolled in our internally administered traveler loyalty rewards programs earn points for each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for free or discounted future bookings. hotels.com rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions.
expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on various brand expedia websites. orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks, the currency of orbitz rewards, on flights, hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques. revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points, that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. the majority of rewards expected to be redeemed are recognized within oneto two yearsof being earned. at december 31, 2020,$ 769million of deferred loyalty rewards was reported within deferred merchant bookings, $ 569million of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended december 31, 2021. at december 31, 2021, the related balance was $ 798million.
deferred revenue. deferred revenue primarily consists of unearned subscription revenue as well as deferred advertising revenue.at december 31, 2020, $ 172million was recorded as deferred revenue, $ 105million of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended december 31, 2021. at december 31, 2021, the related balance was $
166million.
practical expedients and exemptions. we have used the portfolio approach to account for our loyalty points as the rewards programs share similar characteristics within each program in relation to the value provided to the traveler and their breakage patterns. using this portfolio approach is not expected to differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts. however, we will continue to assess and refine, if necessary, how a portfolio within each rewards program is defined.
we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.

table of contents cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial instruments, including u.s. treasury securities, money market funds and term deposit investments, with maturities of three months or less when purchased. restricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents that is restricted through legal contracts, regulations or our intention to use the cash for a specific purpose. our restricted cash primarily relates to certain traveler deposits and to a lesser extent collateral for office leases. the following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in our consolidated balance sheets to the total amount presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows:

the consolidated statement of cash flow short-term and long-term investments we determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. investments, other than minority equity investments, classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("oci"). realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale investments, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. investments with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments. all other investments are classified within long-term investments and other assets.
minority equity investments with either readily determinable fair values, such as our investment in despegar.com corp ("despegar"), or for which we have elected to apply the fair value option, such as our indirect investment in american express global business travel ("gbt"), are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded through net income or loss. minority investments without readily determinable fair values, for which we have not elected to measure at fair value, are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with observable price changes reflected through net income or loss. we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. changes in value of minority equity investments are recorded in other income (expense), net.
accounts receivable accounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are recorded net of an allowance for expected uncollectible amounts. we consider accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms as past due. the risk characteristics we generally review when analyzing our accounts receivable pools primarily include the type of receivable (for example, credit card vs hotel collect), collection terms and historical or expected credit loss patterns. for each pool, we make estimates of expected credit losses for our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, previous loss history continually updated for new collections data, the credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. the provision for estimated credit losses is recorded as cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. we also capitalize certain costs incurred related to the development of internal use software. we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal use software. we expense costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development as incurred.
we compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is threeto five yearsfor computer equipment, capitalized software development and furniture and other equipment,
15years for land improvements, and 40years for buildings, which includes our corporate headquarters. land is not depreciated. we amortize leasehold improvement using the straight-line method, over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease.
f- 14
table of contents we establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to return certain of our leased facilities to their original condition under the authoritative accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations. such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated restoration costs.
leases we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. operating leases are primarily for office space and data centers and are included in operating lease right-of-use ("rou") assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
for operating leases with a term of one year or less, we have elected to not recognize a lease liability or rou asset on our consolidated balance sheet. instead, we recognize the lease payments as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. short-term lease costs are immaterial to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.
we have office space and data center lease agreements with insignificant non-lease components and have elected the practical expedient to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
business combinations we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition.
any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names, and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. any changes to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. we assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, neither of which is amortized, for impairment annually as of october 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired.
we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units, except for trivago, which is a separately listed company on the nasdaq global select market, on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary, which is based on market valuation. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. the fair value of the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago's stock price, a level 1 input, adjusted for an estimated control premium.
we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet f- 15
table of contents industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.
in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company's total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.
in our evaluation of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, we typically first perform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value, if necessary. we base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. as with goodwill, periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired.
recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of oneto ten years. we review the carrying value of long-
lived assets or asset groups, including property and equipment, to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
assets held for sale, to the extent we have any, are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.
redeemable non-controlling interests we have non-controlling interests in majority owned entities, which were carried at fair value as the non-
controlling interests contained certain rights, whereby we could acquire and the minority shareholders could sell to us the additional shares of the company. if the redeemable non-controlling interest is redeemable at an amount other than fair value, we adjust the non-controlling interest to redemption value through earnings each period. in circumstances where the non-controlling interest is redeemable at fair value, changes in fair value of the shares for which the minority holders could sell to us were recorded to the non-controlling interest and as charges or credits to retained earnings (or additional paid-in capital in the absence of retained earnings). fair value determinations required high levels of judgment ("level 3" on the fair value hierarchy) and were based on various valuation techniques, including market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.we had noredeemable non-
controlling interests as of december 31, 2021 and $ 13million of redeemable non-controlling interests, which were included within other long-term liabilities, as of december 31, 2020.
income taxes we record income taxes under the liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense.
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated f- 16
table of contents operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.
we account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria. the first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority, including resolution of any appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. if the tax position meets the more likely than not criteria, the portion of the tax benefit greater than
50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements.
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line in our consolidated statement of operations. accrued interest and penalties are included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
in relation to tax effects for accumulated oci, our policy is to release the tax effects of amounts reclassified from accumulated oci to pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations. any remaining tax effect in accumulated oci is released following a portfolio approach.
we account for the global intangible low-tax income ("gilti") earned by our foreign subsidiaries included in gross u.s. taxable income in the period incurred.
derivative instruments derivative instruments are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. the fair values of the derivative financial instruments generally represent the estimated amounts we would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the contracts as of the reporting date.
at december 31, 2021 and 2020, our derivative instruments primarily consisted of foreign currency forward contracts. we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-
denominated operating liabilities. our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce, to the extent practicable, our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. our foreign currency forward contracts are typically short-term and, as they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we classify the changes in their fair value in other, net. we do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
in june 2015, we issued euro 650million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 2.5% (the " 2.5% notes"). the aggregate principal value of the 2.5% notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries. the notes are measured at euro to u.s. dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated oci. the euro-denominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars at each balance sheet date, with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated oci. since the notional amount of the recorded euro-denominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment, we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge.
foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses certain of our operations outside of the united states use the related local currency as their functional currency.
we translate revenue and expense at average rates of exchange during the period. we translate assets and liabilities at the rates of exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and include foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of accumulated oci. due to the nature of our operations and our corporate structure, we also have subsidiaries that have significant transactions in foreign currencies other than their functional currency. we record transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring remeasurement and settlement of such transactions.
to the extent practicable, we attempt to minimize this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities of similarly denominated foreign currencies. additionally, as discussed above, we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities.
debt issuance costs we defer costs we incur to issue debt, which are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, and amortize these costs to interest expense over the term of the debt or in circumstances where the debt can be redeemed at the option of the holders, over the term of the redemption option.
marketing promotions f- 17
table of contents we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services.
generally, our incentive offers are as follows:
current discount offers. these promotions include dollar or percent off discounts to be applied against current purchases. we record the discounts as reduction in revenue at the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.
inducement offers. these promotions include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase. we treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. we allocate the discount amount at the time of the offer between the current performance obligation and the potential future performance obligations based on our expected relative value of the transactions. we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers.
concession offers. these promotions include discounts to be applied against a future purchase to maintain customer satisfaction. upon issuance, we record these concession offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for concession offers.
advertising expense we incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs, including television and radio advertising, and online advertising expense to promote our brands. we expense the production costs associated with advertisements in the period in which the advertisement first takes place. we expense the costs of communicating the advertisement (e.g., television airtime) as incurred each time the advertisement is shown.for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020
and 2019, our advertising expense was $ 2.7billion, $ 1.2billion and $ 3.5billion.
stock-based compensation we measure and amortize the fair value of restricted stock units ("rsus") and stock options as follows:
restricted stock units. rsus are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests, typically over a four-yearperiod, but may accelerate in certain circumstances.
during 2019, we started issuing rsus as our primary form of stock-based compensation, which vested 25% after one yearand then vested quarterly over the following three years. beginning in 2021, we adopted a new vesting schedule for annual equity grants that provides for immediate quarterly vesting over the same four yearterm. we measure the value of rsus at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. we amortize the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line basis. in addition, we have a limited number of performance stock units ("psus"), for which we calculate the fair value using a monte carlo valuation model and amortized the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, as stock-based compensation over the vesting term, generally a twoor three yearperiod, on an accelerated basis. the number of shares that ultimately vest depends on achieving certain performance metrics or performance goals, as applicable, by the end of the performance period, assuming there is no accelerated vesting for, among other things, a termination of employment under certain circumstances. we record rsus that may be settled by the holder in cash, rather than shares, as a liability and we remeasure these instruments at fair value at the end of each reporting period. upon settlement of these awards, our total compensation expense recorded over the vesting period of the awards will equal the settlement amount, which is based on our stock price on the settlement date.
stock options. our employee stock options consist of service based awards, some of which also have market-based vesting conditions. we measure the value of stock options issued or modified, including unvested options assumed in acquisitions, on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, including the black-scholes and monte carlo option pricing models, for awards that contain market-based vesting conditions. we amortize the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, over the remaining explicit vesting term in the case of service-based awards and the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions on a straight-line basis. in addition, we classify certain employee option awards as liabilities when we deem it not probable that the employees holding the awards will bear the risk and rewards of stock ownership for a reasonable period of time. such options are revalued at the end of each reporting period and upon settlement our total compensation expense recorded from grant date to settlement date will equal the settlement amount. the majority of our stock options vest over four years.
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value.
f- 18
table of contents earnings per share we compute basic earnings per share by taking net income or loss attributable to expedia group, inc. available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common and class b common shares outstanding during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow. diluted earnings per share include the potential dilution that could occur from stock-based awards and other stock-based commitments (which includes our convertible notes) using the treasury stock or the if converted method, as applicable. for additional information on how we compute earnings per share, see note 12 - earnings per share.
fair value recognition, measurement and disclosure the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value as we maintain them with various high-quality financial institutions. the accounts receivable are short-term in nature and are generally settled shortly after the sale.
we disclose the fair value of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy using the following three categories:
level 1 - valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
level 2 - valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
level 3 - valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the company's own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. these valuations require significant judgment.
certain risks and concentrations our business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers, primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and payment related fraud. we also rely on global distribution system partners and third-party service providers for certain fulfillment services .
financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. we maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances with financial institutions that are in excess of federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits. our cash and cash equivalents are primarily composed of term deposits as well as bank (both interest and non-interest bearing) account balances denominated in u.s. dollars, euros, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, australian dollar, japanese yen and brazilian real.
contingent liabilities we have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding, as discussed further in note 15 - commitments and contingencies. periodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess the potential financial exposure. when (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and
(ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. we provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. we base accruals made on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
occupancy and other taxes some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax, and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. generally, hotels collect taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. when a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. in most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain. some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to collect and f- 19
table of contents remit such taxes. a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against certain of our companies for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on our services. we are an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting a vacation property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes. we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes when determined to be probable and estimable. see note 15 - commitments and contingencies for further discussion.
recently adopted accounting policies simplifying the accounting for income taxes. as of january 1, 2021, we adopted the accounting standards updates
("asu") guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. this new standard eliminated certain exceptions in current guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. it also clarified and simplified other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement s .
investments - equity securities; investments - equity method and joint ventures; derivatives and hedging. as of january 1, 2021, we adopted the new asu guidance which clarified the interaction between the accounting for investments in equity securities, equity method investments and certain derivative instruments. the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement s .
accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity. as of january 1, 2021, we adopted the new asu guidance which simplified the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity's own equity. specifically, the standard simplified accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current gaap, removing certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which permitted more equity contracts to qualify for it, and simplified the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement s . the convertible senior notes issued in february 2021 are accounted for in accordance with this new guidance. see note 7 - debt and note 12 - earnings per share for additional information.
recent accounting policies not yet adopted in october 2021, the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance relate to recognizing and measuring contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. the new guidance will require acquiring entities to apply topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as compared to current gaap where an acquirer generally recognizes such items at fair value on the acquisition date. the new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. while we are continuing to assess the timing and the potential impacts of adoption, we do not expected it will have a material impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.

we classify our cash equivalents and investments within level 1 and level 2 as we value our cash equivalents and investments using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. valuation of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on foreign currency exchange rates in active markets, a level 2 input.
we hold term deposit investments with financial institutions. term deposits with original maturities of less than three months are classified as cash equivalents and those with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments.
as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of term deposits, money market funds and u.s. treasury securities with maturities of three months or less and bank account balances.
our equity investments include our marketable equity investment in despegar, a publicly traded company, which is included in long-term investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. during the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recognized a loss of approximately $ 29million, a loss of approximately $
6million, and a gain of approximately $ 10million, respectively, within other, net in our consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value changes of this equity investment.
we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. as of december 31, 2021, we were party to outstanding forward contracts hedging our liability exposures with a total f- 21
table of contents net notional value of $ 1.7billion. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net forward assets of $ 3million ($
12million gross forward asset) recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $ 14million ($ 23million gross forward liability) recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. we recorded $ 1million, $
74million and $( 8) million in net gains (losses) from foreign currency forward contracts in 2021, 2020 and 2019.

in connection with our disposition of egencia as discussed in note 16 - acquisitions and divestiture, we received an indirect equity interest in gbt. the initial fair value estimate as of november 1 , 2021 was based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, level 3 inputs. the unobservable inputs used in the discounted cash flows model included projected ebitda margin growth rates of approximately 24%, a long term growth rate of 2.5%, and a weighted average cost of capital of 9%. our significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors that could be reasonably considered investment alternatives and assessing comparable valuation multiples while applying a control premium in estimating the fair value of the investment. the unobservable inputs to the market approach included a revenue multiple of 3.5x and a control premium of 20%. significant increases or decreases in the inputs to the discounted cash flow or market value approach would result in a significant higher or lower fair value measurements. as of december 31, 2021, we concluded that there was no change in valuation.
assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity method investments, are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized or the underlying investment is sold. such fair value measurements are based predominately on level 3 inputs. we measure our minority investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes with changes recorded within other, net on our consolidated statements of operations.
goodwill . during 2021, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $ 14million in our b2b segment resulting from valuing a component of our egencia reporting unit that remained after the sale on november 1, 2021.
during 2020, due to the severe and persistent negative effect covid-19 had on global economies, the travel industry and our business, as well as the uncertainty and high variability in anticipated versus actual rates of recovery, in addition to our annual assessment on october 1, 2020, we deemed it necessary to perform various interim assessments of goodwill. as a result of assessments during 2020, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $
799million, of which $ 559million related to our retail segment, primarily our vrbo reporting unit, and $
240million related to our trivago segment.
our assessments compared the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying value. the fair value estimates for all reporting units, except trivago, were based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, level 3 inputs. the significant estimates used in the discounted cash flows model included our weighted average cost of capital, projected cash flows and the long-term rate of growth. our assumptions were based on the actual historical performance of the reporting unit and took into account operating result trends, the anticipated duration of covid-19 impacts and rates of recovery, and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our equity and debt as of the assessment dates. our significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and earnings multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. the fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago's stock price, a level 1 input, adjusted for an estimated control premium. the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over our estimate of the fair value was recorded as goodwill impairment charges during 2020. as of december 31, 2020, the applicable reporting units within our retail segment had $ 2.3billion goodwill remaining after the impairments incurred in 2020 and our trivago segment had $ 337million goodwill remaining.
intangible and long-term assets. during 2021, we recognized long-term asset impairment charges of $ 6million in our b2b segment resulting from the write-off of capitalized software of a component of our egencia reporting unit that remained after the sale on november 1, 2021.
during 2020, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $ 175million within our retail segment, of which
$ 119million related to indefinite-lived trade names that resulted from changes in estimated future revenues of the related brands as well as $ 35million related to definite-lived intangible assets and $ 21million related to other long-lived assets.
f- 22
table of contents the indefinite-lived intangible assets, classified as level 3 measurements, were valued using the relief-from-
royalty method, which includes unobservable inputs, including projected revenues and royalty rates, which ranged from 2% to 8% with a weighted average royalty rate of 7%. for definite-lived intangible assets, classified as level
3 measurements, we compared the estimated future, net undiscounted cash flows, which included key inputs such as rates of growth and profitability of our business as well as incremental net working capital, to the long-lived asset's carrying amount. during 2020, we met the criteria to recognize certain smaller businesses within our retail segment as held-for-sale. as such, we remeasured the disposal groups at fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a level 3 measurement and was based on each transaction's estimated consideration as of the date of close.
the full duration and total impact of covid-19 remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict how the recovery will continue to unfold (in general and versus our expectations) for global economies, the travel industry or our business. additionally, as the stock of our trivago segment is publicly traded, it is difficult to predict market dynamics and the extent or duration of any stock price declines. as a result, we may continue to record impairment charges in the future due to the potential long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the covid-19 pandemic.
minority investments without readily determinable fair values. as of both december 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying values of our minority investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $ 330million. during 2021, we had nomaterial gains or losses recognized related to these minority investments. during 2020, we recorded $
134million of losses related to a minority investment, which had recent observable and orderly transactions for similar investments, using an option pricing model that utilizes judgmental inputs such as discounts for lack of marketability and estimated exit event timing. during 2019, we recorded $ 2million of losses related to the minority investments. as of december 31, 2021, total cumulative adjustments made to the initial cost basis of these investments included $ 2million in unrealized upward adjustments and $ 105million in unrealized downward adjustments (including impairments).

(1) net of applicable discounts and debt issuance costs.
outstanding debt during 2021, we took a number of actions to reduce our cost of capital, including extinguishing higher cost debt issued in the prior year as well as issuing new debt with more favorable terms.
extinguishment of debt. during 2021, we used the net proceeds from the february and march 2021 private placements discussed below, to (i) finance a redemption of all of our outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2025 (the " 7.0%
notes"), (ii) finance a tender offer for a portion of our issued and outstanding 6.25% senior notes due 2025 (the "
6.25% notes") and (iii) to pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing. on march 3, 2021, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding 7.0% notes as well as settled the tender offer to purchase $ 956million in aggregate principal of our 6.25% notes, which resulted in the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of $
280million during the year ended december 31, 2021. this loss primarily reflected the payment of early payment premiums and fees associated with the tender offer as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. the cash payments related to the debt extinguishment were classified as cash outflows from financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows and were $ 258million during the year ended december 31, 2021, which reflected the $ 280million loss on debt extinguishment adjusted for the non-cash write-off of debt issuance costs of approximately $ 23million. in addition, we paid accrued and unpaid interest on the 7.0% and tendered portion of the
6.25% notes up to the date of settlement.
february 2021 convertible senior notes private placement. on february 19, 2021, we completed our private placement of $ 1billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the "convertible notes"). the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes was approximately $ 983million after deducting debt issuance costs.
the convertible notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with each other and with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, including our existing senior notes. the convertible notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the subsidiary guarantors, which include each domestic subsidiary that is a borrower under or guarantees the obligations under our existing senior secured credit agreement. so long as the guarantees are in effect, each subsidiary guarantor's guarantee will be the unsecured, unsubordinated obligation of such subsidiary guarantor and will rank equally in right of payment with each other and with all of such subsidiary guarantor's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, including such subsidiary guarantor's guarantees of our existing senior notes.
the convertible notes will mature on february 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. the convertible notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the convertible notes will not accrete.
the convertible notes have an initial conversion rate of 3.9212 shares of common stock of expedia group with a par value $ 0.0001per share (referred to as "our common stock" herein), per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, which f- 26
table of contents is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 255.02per share of our common stock. the conversion rate is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to, the issuance of stock dividends and payment of cash dividends. at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding november 15, 2025, holders may convert their convertible notes at their option only under the following circumstances:
• during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on march 31, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price then in effect on each applicable trading day;
• during the fivebusiness day period immediately after any fiveconsecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;
• if the company calls any or all of the convertible notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the redemption date, but only with respect to the convertible notes called for redemption (or deemed called for redemption); or
• upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
irrespective of the foregoing conditions, holders may convert their convertible notes on or after november 15, 2025
and prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
additionally, upon the occurrence of a corporate event that constitutes a "make-whole fundamental change" per the indenture, or if we call the convertible notes for redemption, and a holder elects to convert its convertible notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or during the related redemption period, as the case may be, such holder may be entitled to an increase in the conversion rate in certain circumstances as described in the indenture. upon conversion, holders will receive cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
we may not redeem the convertible notes prior to february 20, 2024. on or after february 20, 2024 and prior to the
41st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period)
ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, we may redeem for cash all or part of the convertible notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, except as otherwise described in the indenture.
the net carrying amount of the convertible notes as of december 31, 2021 was $ 986million, which reflects the $
1billion in principal less unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 14million. interest expense related to the amortization of the debt issuance costs for the convertible notes was $ 3million during the year ended december 31,
2021.

99.081% of the aggregate principal amount. interest is payable semi-annually in arrears in march and september of each year, beginning september 15, 2021, and the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on certain ratings events. we may redeem some or all of the 2.95% notes at any time prior to december 15, 2030 by paying a "make-
whole" premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. we may redeem some or all of the 2.95% notes on or after december 15, 2030 at par plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2.95%

f- 32
table of contents as of december 31, 2021, we have a valuation allowance of approximately $ 171million related to certain tax attribute carryforwards for which it is more likely than not the tax benefits will not be realized. the valuation allowance decreased by $ 45million from the amount recorded as of december 31, 2020 primarily due to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards, as well as foreign operating losses. the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, may be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income increase, taxable income of the appropriate character is forecasted, capital gains are realized or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative gaap losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
due to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits in 2017, the majority of previously unremitted earnings have been subjected to u.s. federal income tax. to the extent the repatriation resulted in differences between the gaap and tax carrying values of expedia group's investment in foreign subsidiaries whose offshore earnings are not indefinitely reinvested, or to the extent future distributions from these subsidiaries will be taxable, a deferred tax liability has been accrued.
the amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the united states, and for which future distributions could be taxable, was $ 69million as of december 31, 2021. the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the u.s.
federal income tax consequences of these earnings was $ 18million as of december 31, 2021.

our effective tax rate for 2021 was higher than the 21% u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due to excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, release of valuation allowance and research and experimentation credits, partially offset by nondeductible compensation, measured against a pre-tax loss. our effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the 21% u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due to valuation allowances and nondeductible impairments measured against a pre-tax loss our effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the 21%
u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due to state income taxes, foreign income taxed at higher than the u.s.
federal statutory tax rate, as well as losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we did not record a tax benefit.

as of december 31, 2021, we had $ 349million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $ 213million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. as of december 31, 2020, we had $ 345million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $ 219million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. as of december 31, 2019, we had $ 305million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $ 188million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, total gross interest and penalties accrued was $ 56million and $ 49million, respectively. we recognized interest expense of $ 7million in 2021, $ 12million in 2020 and $ 8million in 2019 in connection with our unrecognized tax benefits.
the company is routinely audited by u.s. federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities. these audits include questioning the timing and amount of income and deductions, and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. the internal revenue service ("irs") is currently examining expedia group's consolidated u.s. federal income tax returns for the periods ended december 31, 2011 through december 31, 2016. the company has consented to an extension of the statute of limitations, until march 31, 2023 related to the 2011
through 2016 tax years, and until june 30, 2022 related to the 2017 tax year. as of december 31, 2021, for the expedia group, inc. and subsidiaries group, statute of limitations for tax years 2011 through 2020 remain open to examination in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and most state jurisdictions. for the homeaway and orbitz groups, the tax years 2001 through 2015 remain subject to examination in the u.s. federal and most state jurisdictions due to nol carryforwards.
during the fourth quarter of 2019, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 tax years. the proposed adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by $ 696million, which would result in u.s. federal tax of approximately $
244million, subject to interest. we do not agree with the position of the irs. we filed a protest with the irs for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and appeals returned the case to exam for further review. we are also under examination by the irs for our 2014 to 2016 tax years. subsequent years remain open to examination by the irs. we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years.

preferred stock and warrants on may 5, 2020, we issued and sold to (1) ap fort holdings, l.p., an affiliate of apollo global management, inc.
(the "apollo purchaser"), 600,000shares of the company's newly created series a preferred stock, par value $
0.001per share (the "series a preferred stock") and warrants (the "warrants") to purchase 4.2million shares of our common stock for an f- 34

during the second quarter of 2020, we suspended quarterly dividends on our common stock. at this time, we do not currently expect to declare future dividends on our common stock. future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors.
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
the balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of december 31, 2021 and 2020 was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments. these translation adjustments include foreign currency transaction losses at december 31, 2021 and 2020 of $ 15million ($ 22million before tax) and $ 69million ($ 90million before tax)
associated with our 2.5% notes. the 2.5% notes are euro-denominated debt designated as hedges of certain of our euro-denominated net assets. see note 2 - significant accounting policies for more information.
non-redeemable non-controlling interests as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, our ownership interest in trivago was approximately 58.3% and 59.0%.
note 12 - earnings per share basic earnings per share basic earnings per share was calculated for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 using the weighted average number of common and class b common shares outstanding during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow.
diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2019, we computed diluted earnings per share using (i) the number of shares of common stock and class b common stock used in the basic earnings per share calculation as indicated above, (ii) if dilutive, the incremental common stock that we would issue upon the assumed exercise or vesting of stock-based awards and common stock warrants using the treasury stock method, and (iii) other stock-based commitments. in periods when we recognize a net loss, such as the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, we exclude the impact of outstanding stock-based awards, common stock warrants and the potential share settlement impact related to our convertible notes from the diluted loss per share calculation as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.

for the year ended december 31, 2021, approximately 11million of outstanding stock-based awards and approximately four millionshares related to the potential share settlement impact related to our convertible notes have been excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders because their effect would have been antidilutive. for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 22million of outstanding stock-based awards and common stock warrants and seven millionof outstanding stock-based awards, respectively, were excluded.
the earnings per share amounts are the same for common stock and class b common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.
note 13 - restructuring and related reorganization charges in 2020, we committed to restructuring actions intended to simplify our businesses and improve operational efficiencies, which have resulted in headcount reductions and office consolidations. as a result, we recognized $
55million and $ 231million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2021 and 2020, respectively.
we continue to evaluate additional cost reduction efforts and should we make decisions in future periods to take further actions we may incur additional reorganization charges.
we also engaged in certain smaller scale restructure actions in 2019 to centralize and migrate certain operational functions and systems, for which we recognized $ 24million in restructuring and related reorganization charges, which were primarily related to severance, benefits and professional fees.

our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors.
these minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods. payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use.
we have guarantees which consist primarily of bonds relating to tax assessments that we are contesting as well as bonds required by certain foreign countries' aviation authorities for the potential non-delivery, by us, of packaged travel sold in those countries. the authorities also require that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel sold be bonded. our guarantees also include certain surety bonds related to various company performance obligations.
f- 38
table of contents our locs consist of stand-by locs, underwritten by a group of lenders, which we primarily issue for certain regulatory purposes as well as to certain hotel properties to secure our payment for hotel room transactions. the contractual expiration dates of these locs are shown in the table above. there were no material claims made against any stand-by locs during the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various lawsuits. management does not expect these lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of expedia group. we also evaluate other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax, excise tax, sales tax, transient occupancy or accommodation tax and similar matters. we do not believe that the aggregate amount of liability that could be reasonably possible with respect to these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial results;
however, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual losses incurred in the event that our legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
litigation relating to occupancy taxes. one hundred threelawsuits have been filed by or against cities, counties and states involving hotel occupancy and other taxes. eightlawsuits are currently active. these lawsuits are in various stages and we continue to defend against the claims made in them vigorously. with respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. we believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations. to date, forty-nineof these lawsuits have been dismissed. some of these dismissals have been without prejudice and, generally, allow the governmental entity or entities to seek administrative remedies prior to pursuing further litigation. thirty-
fourdismissals were based on a finding that we and the other defendants were not subject to the local tax ordinance or that the local government lacked standing to pursue its claims. as a result of this litigation and other attempts by certain jurisdictions to levy such taxes, we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $ 50million and $ 58million as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. our settlement reserve is based on our best estimate of probable losses and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. an estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made. changes to the settlement reserve are included within legal reserves, occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations.
pay-to-play. certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as
"pay-to-play." payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. if we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.
we are in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities, some of which, including in the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes, may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.
matters relating to international vat . we are in various stages of inquiry or audit in multiple european union jurisdictions regarding the application of vat to our european union related transactions. while we believe we comply with applicable vat laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes. in certain jurisdictions, including the united kingdom, we may be required to "pay-to-play" any vat assessment prior to contesting its validity. while we believe that we will be successful based on the merits of our positions with regard to audits in pay-to-play jurisdictions, it is nevertheless reasonably possible that we could be required to pay any assessed amounts in order to contest or litigate the applicability of any assessments and an estimate for a reasonably possible amount of any such payments cannot be made.
competition and consumer matters . on august 23, 2018, the australian competition and consumer commission, or
"accc", instituted proceedings in the australian federal court against trivago. the accc alleged breaches of australian consumer law, or "acl," relating to trivago's advertisements in australia concerning the hotel prices available on trivago's australian site, trivago's strike-through pricing practice and other aspects of the way offers for accommodation were displayed on trivago's australian website. the matter went to trial in september 2019
and, on january 20, 2020, the australian federal court issued a judgment finding trivago had engaged in conduct in breach of the acl. on october 18 and 19, 2021, the australian federal court heard submissions from the parties regarding penalties and other orders. in its submissions, the accc proposed a penalty of at least au$ 90million and an injunction restraining trivago from engaging in misleading conduct of the type found by the australian federal court to be in contravention of the acl. trivago submitted that an appropriate penalty for f- 39
table of contents the court to impose would be in the order of up to au$ 15million. the parties await a ruling. we recorded an estimated probable loss of approximately $ 11million with respect to these proceedings in a previous period. an estimate for the reasonable possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made.
note 16 - divestitures on november 1, 2021, we completed the sale of egencia, expedia group's corporate travel arm included within our b2b segment, to gbt. as a result of the sale, we deconsolidated egencia, recognized a gain of $ 401million within gain
(loss) on sale of business, net in the consolidated statement of operations and divested cash and restricted cash of $ 88million. we received no cash for this transaction but expedia group became an indirect holder of an approximately 19% interest of gbt with an initial fair value of $ 815million, and a subsidiary entered into a
10-yearlodging supply agreement with gbt. we have elected to account for our investment under the fair value option
(see note 3 - fair value measurements). the 19% of indirect interest is subject to changes based on final debt/cash and working capital adjustments and, any such adjustment, would impact our gain on the sale.
in addition, during 2020 and 2021, in connection with our efforts to focus on our core businesses and streamline our activities, we committed to plans to divest certain smaller businesses primarily within our retail segment. as a result, in 2020, we completed the sale of certain smaller businesses, including bodybuilding.com and silverrail, which combined resulted in a net losses of $ 13million and net cash divested of $ 21million. in 2021, we completed additional sales including classic vacations and alice, which combined resulted in net gains of $ 57million and net cash received of $ 27million. the resulting gains and losses in these transactions were recorded within gain (loss)
on sale of business, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
none of these dispositions were considered a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results and they did not represent individually significant components of our business; therefore, they have not been reported as discontinued operations.
note 17 - liberty expedia holdings transaction on july 26, 2019, expedia group acquired all of the outstanding shares of liberty expedia holdings, inc. ("liberty expedia holdings") in a merger transaction in which the outstanding shares of liberty expedia holdings' series a common stock and series b common stock were exchanged for newly issued shares of common stock of expedia group with a fair value of $ 2.9billion, assumption of $ 400million in debt and $ 15million of cash (the "liberty expedia transaction"). we accounted for the acquired liberty expedia holdings assets and liabilities, except for the expedia group shares repurchased, as a business combination. we accounted for the acquired expedia group shares held by liberty expedia holdings as a share repurchase for consideration of $ 3.2billion. as a result of this transaction, expedia group's shares outstanding were reduced by approximately 3.1million shares. the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination was $ 96million, which was primarily comprised of $
78million of cash and $ 10million of a trade name definite lived intangible asset related to bodybuilding.com.
bodybuilding.com is primarily an internet retailer of dietary supplements, sports nutrition products, and other health and wellness products. nogoodwill was recorded for the portion of the transaction accounted for as a business combination.
in connection with the liberty expedia transaction, a wholly-owned subsidiary of expedia group, inc. ("merger llc")
assumed the obligations of liberty expedia holdings with respect to the $ 400million aggregate outstanding principal amount of 1.0% exchangeable senior debentures due 2047 issued by liberty expedia holdings (the
"exchangeable debentures") and the indenture governing the exchangeable debentures. on august 26, 2019, merger llc redeemed all of the exchangeable debentures in exchange for a total payment, including accrued and unpaid interest, of approximately $ 401million.
bodybuilding.com was consolidated into our financial statements starting on the acquisition date and we recognized
$ 58million in revenue and $ 7million in operating losses for the year ended december 31, 2019, which was included within corporate and eliminations in our segment footnote.

former governance agreement during 2018 through july 26, 2019, liberty expedia holdings (as assignee of qurate retail, inc. ("qurate")) was a party to the amended and restated governance agreement, dated as of december 20, 2011, as amended, among the company, liberty expedia holdings and mr. diller (the "former governance agreement"), pursuant to which liberty expedia holdings had the right to nominate up to a number of directors equal to 20% of the total number of the directors on the board (rounded f- 41
table of contents up to the next whole number if the number of directors on the board were not an even multiple of five) and had certain rights regarding committee participation, so long as liberty expedia holdings satisfied certain stock ownership requirements. the former governance agreement was terminated on july 26, 2019 upon the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, at which time, pursuant to the merger agreement, each of the three directors serving on the expedia group board of directors who were nominated by liberty expedia holdings resigned from the board.
new governance agreement simultaneously with the entry into the merger agreement, the company and mr. diller entered into a second amended and restated governance agreement (the "governance agreement," the rights contemplated by which and by the exchange agreement were agreed by mr. diller to be deemed to be in recognition and in lieu of mr. diller's existing rights under the former governance agreement and the stockholders agreement), which provided, among other things, that mr.
diller could exercise a right (the "purchase/exchange right") during the nine month period following the closing of the combination, to acquire up to 7,276,547shares of expedia group class b common stock by (1) exchange with the company (or its wholly owned subsidiary) for an equivalent number of shares of expedia group common stock, or (2)
purchase from the company (or its wholly owned subsidiary) at a price per share equal to the average closing price of expedia group common stock for the fivetrading days immediately preceding notice of exercise (any shares acquired pursuant to the purchase/exchange right, the "additional shares"). the purchase/exchange right could be exercised from time to time in whole or in part.
on april 10, 2020, the company and mr. diller entered into amendment no. 1 (the "governance agreement amendment")
to the new governance agreement. the governance agreement amendment was entered into pursuant to the stipulation and order entered by the delaware court of chancery on march 30, 2020 (the "order"), and was approved by the special litigation committee of the board of directors of the company formed to, among other things, investigate and evaluate the claims raised against certain current and former members of the board of directors and officers of the company in the consolidated action captioned in re expedia group stockholders litigation, consolidated case no.
2019-0494-jtl (the "delaware litigation"). pursuant to the order, mr. diller was not permitted to exercise the purchase/exchange right prior to the special litigation committee notifying mr. diller that it had completed its investigation of the claims raised in the delaware litigation (the "completion date"). the governance agreement amendment extended the deadline by which mr. diller may have exercised the purchase/exchange right to december 7,
2020 (the close of business on the forty-fifth day following the completion date). the purchase/exchange right expired unexercised on december 7, 2020.
subject to limited exception, no current or future holder of original shares may (and no holder of additional shares would have been permitted to) participate in, or vote in favor of, or tender shares into, any change of control transaction involving at least 50% of the outstanding shares or voting power of capital stock of the company, unless such transaction provides for the same per share consideration and mix of consideration (or election right) and the same participation rights for shares of class b common stock and shares of expedia group common stock. these requirements negotiated by the expedia group special committee and agreed to by mr. diller under the governance agreement did not exist under the former governance agreement.
at the 2019 annual meeting of the company's stockholders, the company's stockholders approved a proposal to amend the company's certificate of incorporation to reflect the aforementioned transfer restrictions, automatic conversion provisions and change-of-control restrictions reflected in the governance agreement. the amendment was filed with the secretary of state of delaware on december 3, 2019, and became effective at 11:59 p.m., eastern time, on december 3, 2019.
on november 2, 2021, the parties to the delaware litigation and the special litigation committee entered into a stipulation of compromise and settlement (the "settlement agreement") which sets forth the terms and conditions for the proposed settlement and dismissal with prejudice of the delaware litigation, subject to review and approval by the court. on january 19, 2022, the court entered its order and final judgment (the "settlement order") approving the proposed settlement set forth in the settlement agreement, dismissing the litigation with prejudice and extinguishing and releasing the claims that were or would have been asserted in the litigation against the defendants and related persons. the court also awarded plaintiff's attorneys' fees and expenses in the sum of $
6.5million. pursuant to the settlement agreement, mr. diller, the other defendants, the special litigation committee of the board of directors, and the company agreed to the following governance and related provisions, among others:
• board and executive management composition . prior to mr. diller's departure from all roles at the company ("mr.
diller's departure"), no more than two of mr. diller's immediate family members (including mr. diller) will serve on the company's board of directors at any time. following mr. diller's departure (a) no immediate family member of mr. diller will serve in an executive position at the company or as chair of the company's board of directors and
(b) no more than one diller family member will serve on the board of directors at any time. the company agreed that, following mr. diller's departure, in the event that no family member of mr. diller is serving on the company's board, the company will nominate one diller family member or family-designated representative to serve on the board of directors (subject to the support of two-thirds of the independent directors if the new nominee is a diller family member), so long as mr. diller, his family members and certain related parties (collectively with mr.
diller and his f- 42
table of contents family members, "diller-related persons") in aggregate own at least 5% of the company's outstanding common equity or a 15% voting interest in the company.
the following provisions apply following mr. diller's departure:
• limitation on voting power of class b common shares on certain matters . the voting percentage cast by class b common shares held or controlled by diller-related persons on specified matters will be limited to 20% of the total voting power of the outstanding common shares. the specified matters are (a) any merger, sale or other extraordinary transaction requiring company stockholder approval (with any excess shares to be voted in proportion to votes cast by common shares not held by diller-related persons) and (b) the election of any director-nominee not supported by a majority of the board of directors (with any excess shares to be voted in proportion to votes cast by common shares not held by diller-related persons or others soliciting proxies in respect of one or more nominees not nominated by the company's board of directors).
• provisions relating to sales of class b common shares. before any sale by mr. diller or other diller-related persons of class b common shares representing 10% or more of the company's total voting power, the company will have the opportunity to offer to purchase the shares, and also to accept or reject any counteroffer that the diller-related person may make, subject to certain procedures. if the company does not buy the shares, the selling party will have 10 months following conclusion of the first offer process to sell or agree to sell the shares for not less than the price (if any) offered by the company, after which the company's right of first offer will again apply.
• the company agreed to cooperate reasonably in connection with any sale of class b common shares by mr. diller or other diller-related persons and to use its reasonable efforts to permit any such sale to be completed promptly.
subject to the acquiror agreeing to a customary standstill at 30% of the company's total voting power and absent certain fiduciary duty determinations, the company's obligations include granting a waiver of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which following the acquisition could otherwise restrict certain "business combination" transactions with the acquiror.
following the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, the company ceased to be a controlled company under the nasdaq stock market listing rules and is required to comply with all of nasdaq's corporate governance requirements.
while it is possible that mr. diller may at some point in the future beneficially own more than 50% of the outstanding voting power of the company, the provisions of the governance agreement and the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that, subject to limited exception, no current or future holder of original shares may participate in, or vote or tender in favor of, any change of control transaction involving at least 50% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the company, unless such transaction provides for the same per share consideration and mix of consideration (or election right) and the same participation rights for shares of expedia group class b common stock and shares of expedia group common stock.
other agreements simultaneously with the company's entry into the merger agreement, certain additional related agreements were entered into, including:
a stockholders agreement termination agreement by and among mr. diller, liberty expedia holdings and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of liberty expedia holdings, pursuant to which the stockholders agreement, including the diller proxy, terminated on july 26, 2019, upon the closing of the liberty expedia transaction;
a governance agreement termination agreement, by and among mr. diller, the company, liberty expedia holdings and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of liberty expedia holdings, pursuant to which the former governance agreement terminated on july 26, 2019, upon the closing of the liberty expedia transaction;
an assumption and joinder agreement to tax sharing agreement by and among the company, liberty expedia holdings and qurate, pursuant to which the company agreed to assume, effective at the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, liberty expedia holdings' rights and obligations under the tax sharing agreement, dated as of november
4, 2016, by and between qurate and liberty expedia holdings;
an assumption agreement concerning transaction agreement obligations by and among the company, liberty expedia holdings, qurate and the malone group, pursuant to which the company agreed to assume, effective at the closing of the liberty expedia transaction, certain of liberty expedia holdings' rights and obligations under the amended and restated transaction agreement, dated as of september 22, 2016, as amended by the letter agreement dated as of march 6, 2018, as further amended by amendment no. 2 to transaction agreement, dated as of april 15, 2019 (the
"transaction agreement"), which survived the termination of the transaction agreement; and an assumption and joinder agreement to reorganization agreement by and among the company, liberty expedia holdings and qurate, pursuant to which the company agreed to assume, effective at the closing of the liberty expedia f- 43
table of contents transaction, liberty expedia holdings' rights and obligations under the reorganization agreement, dated as of october 26, 2016, by and between qurate and liberty expedia holdings.
iac/interactivecorp the company and iac are related parties because mr. diller serves as chairman and senior executive of both expedia group and iac. each of expedia group and iac has a 50% ownership interest in threeaircraft that may be used by both companies. in april 2019, expedia group and iac entered into an agreement to jointly acquire the third of the jointly-owned corporate aircraft for a total expected cost of approximately $ 72million (including purchase and related costs) to be split evenly between the two companies. in 2019, we made an initial payment of $ 23million (
50% of the total purchase price and refurbishment costs) for our interest. 2020 payments were nominal and, in september 2021, we paid approximately $ 13million representing expedia group's respective share of the balance upon delivery of the third aircraft. members of the aircraft flight crews are employed by an entity in which the company and iac each have a 50% ownership interest. the company and iac have agreed to share costs relating to flight crew compensation and benefits pro-rata according to each company's respective usage of the aircraft, for which they are separately billed by the entity described above. we share equally in fixed and nonrecurring costs for the aircraft;
direct operating costs are pro-rated based on actual usage. in addition, in december 2021, we entered into agreements pursuant to which we may use additional aircraft owned by a subsidiary of iac on a cost basis. no flights have been undertaken pursuant to this arrangement to date.
as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the net basis in our ownership interest in the planes was $ 60million and $
50million, respectively, recorded in long-term investments and other assets. in 2021, 2020 and 2019, operating and maintenance costs paid directly to the jointly-owned subsidiary for the airplanes were nominal.
note 19 - segment information we have the following reportable segments: retail, b2b, and trivago. our retail segment, which consists of the aggregation of operating segments, provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including: expedia.com and hotels.com in the united states and localized expedia and hotels.com websites throughout the world, vrbo, orbitz, travelocity, wotif group, ebookers, cheaptickets, hotwire.com, carrentals.com and expedia cruises. our b2b segment is comprised of our expedia business services organization including expedia partner solutions, which offers private label and co-branded products to make travel services available to travelers through third-party company branded websites, and egencia (until its sale on november 1, 2021), a full-service travel management company that provides travel services to businesses and their corporate customers. our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites.
we determined our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. our primary operating metric is adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda for our retail and b2b segments includes allocations of certain expenses, primarily related to our global travel supply organization and the majority of costs from our product and technology platform, as well as facility costs and the realized foreign currency gains or losses related to the forward contracts hedging a component of our net merchant lodging revenue. we base the allocations primarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics. we do not allocate certain shared expenses such as accounting, human resources, certain information technology and legal to our reportable segments. we include these expenses in corporate and eliminations. our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change. during the fourth quarter of 2021, we consolidated our divisional finance teams into one global finance organization, which resulted in the reclassification of expenses from retail and b2b into our corporate function. we have reclassified prior period segment information to conform to our current period presentation.
our segment disclosure includes intersegment revenues, which primarily consist of advertising and media services provided by our trivago segment to our retail segment. these intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at amounts that approximate fair value as if the transactions were between third parties, and therefore, impact segment performance. however, the revenue and corresponding expense are eliminated in consolidation. the elimination of such intersegment transactions is included within corporate and eliminations in the table below.
corporate and eliminations also includes unallocated corporate functions and expenses as well as bodybuilding.com through its sale in may 2020. in addition, we record amortization of intangible assets and any related impairment, as well as stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and related reorganization charges, legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, and other items excluded from segment operating performance in corporate and eliminations.
such amounts are detailed in our segment reconciliation below.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020 ("2020 form 10-k"). all percentages within this section are calculated on actual, unrounded numbers.
trends the covid-19 pandemic, and measures to contain the virus, including government travel restrictions and quarantine orders, have had a significant negative impact on the travel industry. covid-19 has negatively impacted consumer sentiment and consumer's ability to travel, and many of our supply partners, particularly airlines and hotels, continue to operate at reduced service levels.
as the spread of the virus has been contained to varying degrees in certain countries during different times, travel restrictions have been lifted and consumers have become more comfortable traveling, particularly to domestic locations. this led to a moderation of the declines in travel bookings and in cancellation rates at certain points in 2021. however, travel bookings remain below and cancellation rates still remain elevated compared to pre-covid levels due largely to the most recent omicron variant.
the degree of containment of the virus, and the recovery in travel, has varied country by country. during the recovery period, there have been instances where cases of covid-19 have started to increase again after a period of decline, which in some cases impacted the recovery of travel in certain countries. additionally, there continues to be uncertainty over the impact of the omicron or other new variants of the virus, including the efficacy of the vaccines against such variants, which has contributed, and may continue to contribute, to delays in economic recovery. covid-19 has also had broader economic impacts, including an increase in unemployment levels and reduction in economic activity globally, which if covid-19 starts to increase again, could lead to a reduction in consumer or business spending on travel activities, which may negatively impact the timing and level of a recovery in travel demand. broader, sustained negative economic impacts could also put strain on our suppliers, business and service partners which increases the risk of credit losses and service level or other disruptions.
our financial and operating results for 2021 were significantly impacted due to the continued decrease in travel demand related to covid-19. the full duration and total impact of covid-19 remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict how the recovery will unfold for the travel industry and, in particular, our business.
additionally, further health-related events, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, sovereign debt issues, and natural disasters, are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future.
prior to the onset of covid-19, we began to execute a cost savings initiative aimed at simplifying the organization and increasing efficiency. following the onset of covid-19, we accelerated execution on several of these cost savings initiatives and took additional actions to reduce costs to help mitigate the impact to demand from covid-19
and reduce our monthly cash usage. while some cost actions during covid-19 are temporary and intended to minimize cash usage during this disruption, we expect to continue to benefit from the majority of the savings when business conditions return to more normalized levels. in 2021, we successfully achieved the previously outlined annualized run-rate fixed cost savings of $700 to $750 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 exit rate, as well as the greater than $200 million in variable costs savings, at 2019 volume levels. we also believe we have improved our marketing efficiency and continue to evaluate additional opportunities to increase efficiency and improve operational effectiveness across the company.
30
table of contents as a result of these cost savings initiatives, we expect adjusted ebitda margins to increase compared to historical levels when revenue returns to more normalized levels.
for additional information about our business strategy for expedia group, see the disclosure set forth in part i, item 1, business, under the caption "marketing opportunity and business strategy."
online travel increased usage and familiarity with the internet has continued to drive rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. online penetration is higher in the u.s. and european markets with online penetration rates in the emerging markets, such as asia pacific and latin american regions, historically lagging behind those regions.
the emerging market penetration rates increased over the past few years, and are expected to continue growing, which presents an attractive growth opportunity for our business, while also attracting many competitors to online travel. this competition intensified in recent years, and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. in addition to the growth of online travel agencies, we see increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies such as google, evidenced by continued product enhancements, including new trip planning features for users and the integration of its various travel products into the google travel offering, as well as further prioritizing its own products in search results. competitive entrants such as
"metasearch" companies, including kayak.com (owned by booking holdings), trivago (in which expedia group owns a majority interest) as well as tripadvisor, introduced differentiated features, pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies, as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools. further, airlines and lodging companies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services.
in addition, the increasing popularity of the "sharing economy," accelerated by online penetration, has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry. businesses such as airbnb, vrbo (previously homeaway, which expedia group acquired in december 2015) and booking.com (owned by booking holdings) have emerged as the leaders, bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market. many other competitors, including vacation rental metasearch players, continue to emerge in this space, which is expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market. finally, traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites expanded their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their websites.
the online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers, which in some cases place pressure on historical business models. in particular, the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe. expedia group facilitates both merchant (expedia collect) and agency (hotel collect) hotel offerings with our hotel supply partners through both agency-only contracts as well as our hybrid etp program, which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay.
in 2020, we shifted to managing our marketing investments holistically across the brand portfolio in our retail segment to optimize results for the company, and making decisions on a market by market and customer segment basis that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity, the expected returns and the competitive environment. over time, intense competition historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries, and a meaningful unfavorable impact on our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins. during 2020, we increased our focus on opportunities to differentiate brands across customer and geographic segments, increase marketing efficiency, drive a higher proportion of transactions through direct channels and ultimately improve the balance of transaction growth and profitability. for more detail, see part i, item 1a, risk factors - "we rely on the value of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing" and "our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally."
lodging lodging includes hotel accommodations and alternative accommodations. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2021, lodging accounted for 75%. as a result of the impact on travel demand from the covid-19 outbreak, room nights grew 35% in 2021 as compared to a decline 55% in 2020 and a growth of 11% in 2019. the timing of recovery in consumer sentiment on travel and on staying at hotels will be a factor in our level of room night growth, and as noted above, we expect that to vary by country. adrs for rooms booked on expedia group websites decreased 1% in 2019, increased 3% in 2020, and increased 20% in 2021. during 2021 and 2020, the increase in adrs for our vrbo business remained elevated compared to years prior to the covid-19 outbreak. vrbo carries a higher adr than hotels and has accounted for a higher percentage of room nights due to the faster recovery and shift to alternative accommodations during these periods.
the uncertain environment as a result of covid-19, including travel restrictions and shifts in consumer behavior, the mix of our lodging bookings across geographies and types of accommodations, and general variability in supply and demand, make it difficult to predict adr trends in the near-term.
31
table of contents as of december 31, 2021, our global lodging marketplace had approximately 3 million lodging properties available, including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings and approximately 875,000 hotels.
hotel. we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations (stand-alone and package bookings). after rolling out etp globally over a period of several years, during which time we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs, our relationships and overall economics with hotel supply partners have been broadly stable in recent years. as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering, in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions. these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth. additionally, increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night and profitability.
since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis, any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night. over the course of the last several years, occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry generally increased on a currency-neutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment. however, due to covid-19, current occupancy rates for hotels in the united states are at reduced levels. in addition, other factors could pressure adr trends, including the continued growth in hotel supply in recent years and the increase in alternative accommodation inventory. further, while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented, there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups. in the meantime, certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on third-party websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points, increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wi-fi.
alternative accommodations. with our acquisition of vrbo (previously homeaway) and all of its brands in december
2015, we expanded into the fast growing alternative accommodations market. vrbo is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia group. vrbo has transitioned from a listings-based classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners, with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology. vrbo offers hosts subscription-based listing or pay-per-booking service models. it also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings. in addition, we have actively moved to integrate vrbo listings into our global retail services, as well as directly add alternative accommodation listings to our offerings, to position our key global brands to offer a full range of lodging options for consumers.
air the airline industry has been dramatically impacted by covid-19. as a result of the significantly reduced air travel demand due to government travel restrictions and the impact on consumer sentiment related to covid-19, airlines have been operating with less capacity and passenger traffic has declined significantly. while we experienced some improvement in air bookings during 2021 versus 2020, it continues to lag lodging bookings and is still meaningfully below 2019 levels. the recovery in air travel remains difficult to predict, and may not correlate with the recovery in lodging demand. according to the transportation security administration ("tsa"), air traveler 7-day average throughput declined 95% in april 2020 compared to prior year levels. the declines moderated to approximately 50% by the end of 2020, and further improved in 2021 with throughput down approximately 20% at the end of the year, compared to 2019 levels.
in addition, there is significant correlation between airline revenue and fuel prices, and fluctuations in fuel prices generally take time to be reflected in air revenue. given current volatility, it is uncertain how fuel prices could impact airfares. we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine, certain supply agreements renew, and as we continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets.
air ticket volumes increased 7% in 2019, declined 63% in 2020, and increased 43% during 2021. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2021, air accounted for 3%.
advertising & media our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago, a leading hotel metasearch website, and expedia group media solutions, which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands. in 2021, we generated $603 million of advertising and media revenue, a 49%
increase from 2020, representing 7% of our total worldwide revenue. given the decline in travel demand related to covid-19, online travel agencies dramatically reduced marketing spend, including on trivago, and given the uncertain duration and impact of covid-19 it is difficult to predict when spend will recover to normalized levels.
in response, in 2020, trivago significantly reduced its marketing spend and took additional actions to lower operating expenses, which continued throughout 2021. we expect trivago to continue to experience pressure on revenue and profit until online travel agencies and other hotel suppliers see consumer demand that warrants increasing in their advertising spend with trivago.
32
table of contents seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. for example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. since revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. historically, vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. furthermore, operating profits for our primary advertising business, trivago, have typically been experienced in the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring, summer and winter holiday travel. as a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. the growth of our international operations, advertising business or a change in our product mix, including the growth of vrbo, may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future.
impacts from covid-19 disrupted our typical seasonal pattern for bookings, revenue, profit and cash flows during
2020 and 2021. significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes, particularly in the first half of
2020, resulted in material operating losses and negative cash flow. although travel volumes remain materially lower than historic levels, booking and travel trends improved during the second half of 2020, and in 2021. this resulted in working capital benefits and positive cash flow more akin to typical historical trends. it remains difficult to forecast the seasonality for the upcoming quarters, given the uncertainty related to the duration of the impact from covid-19 and the shape and timing of any sustained recovery.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. we base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:
• it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and
• changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
for more information on each of these policies, see note 2 - significant accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below.
accounting for certain merchant revenue we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience. actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior.
deferred loyalty rewards we currently offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our travelers, such as our hotels.com rewards program, our expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program. hotels.com rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions. expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on various brand expedia websites. orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks, the currency of orbitz rewards, on flights, hotels and vacation
33
table of contents packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. in 2021, we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform spanning all products and global brands. as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques.
revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points, that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in reward value, product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets goodwill . we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. during 2020, as a result of the significant turmoil related to covid-19, we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform multiple interim impairment assessments. in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and, if applicable, record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired.
we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units, except for trivago, which is a separately listed company on the nasdaq global select market, on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary, which is based on market valuation. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. the fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago's stock price, a level 1 input, adjusted for an estimated control premium.
we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.
in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company's total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.
indefinite-lived intangible assets . we base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.
definite-lived intangible assets. we review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets
34
table of contents over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in an impairment or, in the period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge.
for additional information on our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2021 and 2020, see note 3 -
fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes we record income taxes under the liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense.
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.
we account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria. the first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority, including resolution of any appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. if the tax position meets the more likely than not criteria, the portion of the tax benefit greater than
50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements. the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.
other long-term liabilities various legal and tax contingencies . we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities. in addition, we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss. in addition, our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel. the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.
occupancy and other taxes . some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. generally, hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. when a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. in most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator, on the portion of the customer payment we retain. some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard.
while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes. a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against certain of our companies for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on our services. we are an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting an alternative accommodations property and we believe are similarly not liable for such taxes. we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments, including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments, prior to contesting any such assessments.
35
table of contents we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes.
we note that there are more than 10,000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states, and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction. rather, we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue. many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce. certain jurisdictions have enacted, and others may enact, legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that facilitate the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations. we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level of reserves, as developments warrant.
additionally, certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation, which is discussed in part i, item
3, legal proceedings.
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see note 2 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
occupancy and other taxes we are currently involved in eight lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes. we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. with respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes and/or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide, namely the facilitation of travel planning and reservations, and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations.
for additional information and other recent developments on these and other legal proceedings, see part i, item 3, legal proceedings.
we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $50 million as of december 31, 2021 and $58 million as of december 31, 2020.
certain jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of new york, new jersey, north carolina, minnesota, oregon, rhode island, maryland, pennsylvania, hawaii, iowa, massachusetts, arizona, wisconsin, idaho, arkansas, indiana, maine, nebraska, vermont, mississippi, virginia, the city of new york, and the district of columbia, have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel and/or other accommodations and/or car rental. in addition, in certain jurisdictions, we have entered into voluntary collection agreements pursuant to which we have agreed to voluntarily collect and remit taxes to state and/or local taxing jurisdictions. we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of new york, new jersey, south carolina, north carolina, minnesota, georgia, wyoming, west virginia, oregon, rhode island, montana, maryland, kentucky, maine, pennsylvania, hawaii, iowa, massachusetts, arizona, wisconsin, idaho, arkansas, indiana, nebraska, vermont, colorado, mississippi, virginia, the city of new york and the district of columbia, as well as certain other jurisdictions.
pay-to-play certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as "pay-to-
play." payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. if we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. however, any significant pay-to-play payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity.
other jurisdictions. we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities, some of which, including the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes, may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.

table of contents segments we have the following reportable segments: retail, b2b, and trivago. our retail segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including:
expedia.com and hotels.com in the united states and localized expedia and hotels.com websites throughout the world, vrbo, orbitz, travelocity, wotif group, ebookers, cheaptickets, hotwire.com, carrentals.com and expedia cruises.
our b2b segment is comprised of our expedia business services organization including expedia partner solutions, which offers private label and co-branded products to make travel services available to travelers through third-
party company branded websites, and, through its sale in november 2021, egencia, a full-service travel management company that provides travel services to businesses and their corporate customers. our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites.
operating metrics our operating results are affected by certain metrics, such as gross bookings and revenue margin, which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us. gross bookings generally represent the total retail value of transactions booked for agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are reduced for cancellations and refunds. revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.

___________________________________
(1) trivago, which is comprised of a hotel metasearch business that differs from our transaction-based websites, does not have associated gross bookings or revenue margin. however, third-party revenue from trivago is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin.
the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2021 compared to 2020 reflected improvements in the travel environment.
revenue margin in 2021 was lower than 2020 due in part to significant lodging cancellations in the prior year period, which reduced gross bookings, creating an unusual mix of bookings and revenue.

lodging revenue increased 59% in 2021 on a 35% increase in room nights stayed and an 18% increase in revenue per room night across hotel and alternative accommodations. revenue per room night in 2021 benefited from higher adrs driven by an increase in regional rates and a higher mix of u.s. hotels.
air revenue increased 141% in 2021 driven by an increase in air tickets sold of 43% as air travel demand improved as well as the prior year impact of certain significant covid-19 related accruals that did not repeat in 2021.
advertising and media revenue increased 49% in 2021 due to increases at both trivago and expedia group media solutions. all other revenue, which includes car rental, insurance, destination services, fee revenue related to our corporate travel business (through egencia's sale in november 2021) and bodybuilding.com (through its sale in may 2020), increased 103% in 2021 from growth in travel insurance products as well as car.

the increase in merchant revenue in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in merchant hotel revenue driven by an increase in room nights stayed, an increase in vrbo merchant alternative accommodations revenue and the growth in travel insurance products.
the increase in agency revenue in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in agency hotel, car and air revenue.
advertising, media and other increased 12% in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by declines related to our prior year sale of bodybuilding.com and certain miscellaneous other declines.

cost of revenue primarily consists of direct costs to support our customer operations, including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors; credit card processing, including merchant fees, fraud and chargebacks; and other costs, primarily including data center and cloud costs to support our websites, supplier operations, destination supply, certain transactional level taxes, costs related to bodybuilding.com during our period of ownership as well as related personnel and overhead costs, including stock-
based compensation.
cost of revenue decreased $127 million during 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense, which was significantly elevated in 2020 due to the initial impacts of covid-19, decreased customer service and personnel costs, and the absence of expenses related to bodybuilding.com, which was disposed of in the second quarter of 2020. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in merchant fees resulting from recovering transaction volumes.

selling and marketing expenses increased $1.7 billion during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in direct costs as marketing spend increased in response to improved demand. the change in indirect costs reflect lower personnel costs in connection with previously announced cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense of $48 million.

impairment of goodwill, intangible and other long-term assets during 2021, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14 million and intangible and other long-term asset impairment charges of $6 million related to our b2b segment. during 2020, as a result of the significant negative impact related to covid-19, which has had a severe effect on the entire global travel industry, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $799 million as well as intangible asset impairment charges of $175 million. see note 3 - fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

legal reserves, occupancy tax and other for year ended december 31, 2021 included a charge for certain other legal reserves, mostly offset by net reductions to our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes. during 2020, we recorded a $25 million gain in relation to a legal settlement, which was partially offset by changes in our reserves related to occupancy and other matters.
restructuring and related reorganization charges in 2020, we committed to restructuring actions intended to simplify our businesses and improve operational efficiencies, which have resulted in headcount reductions and office consolidations. as a result, we recognized $55
million and $231 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2021 and 2020. we continue to actively evaluate additional cost reduction efforts and should we make decisions in future periods to take further actions we may incur additional reorganization charges.

adjusted ebitda is our primary segment operating metric. see note 19 - segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on intersegment transactions, unallocated overhead costs and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda by segment to net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. for the periods presented above. during the fourth quarter of 2021, we consolidated our divisional finance teams into one global finance organization, which resulted in the reclassification of expenses from retail and b2b into our corporate function. we have reclassified prior period segment information to conform to our current period presentation.
our retail, b2b and trivago segments all experienced improvements in adjusted ebitda in 2021 as a result of the recovering travel environment as well as impacts of the costs saving initiatives implemented in 2020.
our retail, b2b and trivago segment adjusted ebitda significantly declined during 2020, compared to 2019, resulting from impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, which drove meaningful revenue declines, partially offset by a decline in direct sales and marketing expense as a percent of revenue. unallocated overhead costs decreased $130 million during 2020 primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses.

we are subject to taxation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions. our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. during the fourth quarter of 2019, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to
2013 tax years. the proposed adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by $696 million, which would result in federal tax of approximately $244 million, subject to interest. we do not agree with the position of the irs. we filed a protest with the irs for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and appeals returned our case to exam for further review. we are also under examination by the irs for our 2014 to 2016 tax years. subsequent years remain open to examination by the irs. we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years.
for additional information, see note 10 - income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. we
41
table of contents endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-gaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-gaap measure.
adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above, in the legal proceedings section, as well as the notes to the financial statements. the non-gaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. adjusted for (1) net income
(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net;
(4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans;
(5) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, if any, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree, if any; (6)
certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other; (8)
that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation.
the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. in addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-
based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.

managing our balance sheet prudently and maintaining appropriate liquidity have been high priorities during the covid-19 pandemic. in 2020, in order to best position the company to navigate our temporary working capital changes and depressed revenue, we took a number of actions to bolster our liquidity and preserve financial flexibility. in
2021, we continued certain of these actions, including suspension of our share repurchases and quarterly common stock dividends, but, with an improvement in market condition and trends in the current year, we were able to complete the following actions to reduce our cost of capital:
• 0% convertible notes issuance. in february 2021, we completed our private placement of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the "convertible notes"). the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes was approximately $983 million after deducting debt issuance costs. the convertible notes will mature on february 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. the convertible notes will not bear regular interest. the convertible notes have an initial conversion rate of 3.9212
shares of common stock of expedia group with a par value $0.0001 per share, per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $255.02 per share of our common stock. the conversion rate is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to, the issuance of stock dividends and payment of cash dividends.
• 2.95% senior notes issuance. in march 2021, we privately placed $1 billion of senior unsecured notes that are due in march 2031 that bear interest at 2.95% (the "2.95% notes"). the 2.95% notes were issued at a price of 99.081% of the aggregate principal amount. interest is payable semi-annually in arrears in march and september of each year, beginning september 15, 2021, and the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on certain ratings events. the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2.95% notes was approximately $982 million after deducting the discount and debt issuance costs.
• extinguishment of high cost debt. in march 2021, we used the net proceeds from the convertible notes and 2.95%
notes and completed the redemption of all of our outstanding 7.0% notes as well as settled the tender offer to purchase $956 million in aggregate principal of our 6.25% notes, which resulted in the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of $280 million in 2021 comprised of early payment premiums and fees associated with the tender offer as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
• repayment of preferred stock . in may 2021, we completed the prepayment of 50% of the outstanding series a preferred stock at a price equal to 103% of the preference amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions as to the redemption dates using cash on-hand. in october 2021, we prepaid the remaining 50% of the outstanding series a preferred stock under the same terms as the may prepayment using cash on-hand.
on february 1, 2022, notice was provided to the holders of the company's 2.5% notes due 2022 that the company will redeem all of the €650 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes on march 3, 2022. the redemption price for the notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date.
our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. as of december 31, 2021, moody's rating was baa3
with an outlook of "stable," s&p's rating was bbb- with an outlook of "stable" and fitch's rating was bbb- with an outlook of "negative." changes in our operating results, cash flows, financial position, capital structure, financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase, dividends, investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow and/or limited access to capital markets and interest rates on the 6.25% notes issued in may
2020, the 3.6% and 4.625% notes issued in july 2020 as well as the 2.95% notes issued in march 2021 will increase, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt as detailed in note 7 - debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction. for most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant lodging business, we generally pay after the travelers' use and, in some cases, subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers. therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. typically, the seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings have affected the timing of our annual cash flows. generally, during the first half of the year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. during the second half of the year, this pattern typically reverses and cash flows are typically negative. during 2020, impacts of covid-19 disrupted our typical working
43
table of contents capital trends. significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes, particularly in the first half of
2020, resulted in material operating losses and negative cash flow. although travel volumes remain materially lower than historic levels, booking and travel trends normalized during the second half of 2020, and during 2021 have increased from 2020 levels, resulting in working capital benefits and positive cash flow in the current period more akin to typical historical trends. however, it remains difficult to forecast the working capital trends for the upcoming quarters, given the uncertainty related to the duration of the impact from covid-19 and the shape and timing of any sustained recovery.
prior to covid-19, we embarked on an ambitious cost reduction initiative to simplify the organization and increase efficiency. in response to covid-19, we took several additional actions to further reduce costs to help mitigate the financial impact from covid-19 and continue to improve our long-term cost structure. in addition, certain capital expenditures were deferred in 2020, including temporarily halting construction on several real estate projects. in 2021, as economic conditions improved, we substantially completed the construction of our new headquarters and the project was within the expected total project spend of approximately $900 million. for 2022, we expect total capital expenditures for the full year to increase over 2021 spending levels.
our cash flows are as follows:

on cash and cash equivalents in 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.7 billion compared to cash used in operating activities of $3.8 billion for 2020. in the prior year period, impacts from the covid-19 pandemic resulted in a significant use of cash to fund working capital changes and operating losses compared to a current year cash benefit from working capital. the largest driver of the swing in working capital relates to a significant use of cash in the prior year for deferred merchant bookings as refunds for cancelled bookings exceeded new bookings compared to a meaningful increase in booking volumes and deferred merchant bookings in the current year period.
in 2021, $668 million more cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net purchase of investments of
$178 million in 2021 compared to net sales and maturities of investments of $476 million in 2020, partially offset by lower capital expenditures, including those related to our new headquarters as our construction winds down.
cash used in financing activities in 2021 primarily included payments of approximately $2 billion related to the extinguishment of debt and $1.2 billion for the redemption of preferred stock both discussed above as well as $165
million of cash paid for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments and $67 million in preferred stock dividends. these uses of cash were largely offset by approximately $2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and 2.95% notes issued in february and march 2021, respectively, as well as $503
million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily included $3.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in may and july 2020, $1.1 billion of net proceeds from our private equity issuance, as well as $319 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. these sources of cash were partially offset by the august 2020 repayment of $750 million of 5.95% notes, cash paid to acquire shares of $425 million, including the repurchased shares in the first quarter of 2020 and treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments, and cash dividend payments of $123 million.
our board of directors, or the executive committee, acting on behalf of the board of directors, have authorized share repurchases under authorized programs. as disclosed above, these programs were temporarily halted in early
2020 but repurchases prior to that time were as follows:

table of contents as of december 31, 2021, there were approximately 23.3 million shares remaining under prior repurchase authorizations. there is no fixed termination date for the repurchases.
during 2021, while we didn't pay common stock dividends, we did pay $67 million (or $74.96 per share of series a preferred stock) of dividends on the series a preferred stock. during 2020, the total dividend payment of $123
million included a common stock dividend of $0.34 per share for the first quarter of 2020 as well as $75 million
(or $62.47 per share of series a preferred stock) of dividends on the series a preferred stock. at this time, we do not expect to make future quarterly dividend payments on our common stock. future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors.
foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a decrease of our cash and restricted cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2021 of $177 million reflecting a net depreciation in foreign currencies relative to the u.s.
dollar during the year. foreign exchange rate changes resulted in increases of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2020 of $61 million, reflecting a net appreciation in foreign currencies relative to the u.s.
dollar during the year.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments. our material cash requirements as of december 31, 2021 include the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising in the normal course of business:
• principal payments related to our debt that is included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments. the company had senior notes and convertible notes, as described in note 7 - debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, with varying maturities and an aggregate principal amount of
$8.5 billion, with $735 million payable within 12 months. based on current stated fixed rates and current exchange rates, if applicable, future interest payments associated with the senior notes total approximately $1.6 billion, with approximately $304 million payable within 12 months;
• our operating leases had fixed lease payment obligations, including imputed interest, of $504 million, with $91
million payable within 12 months; and
• purchase obligations representing the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners. these minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods, and payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use. the company had purchase obligations of $824 million, with $589 million payable within 12 months.
in addition, we had $275 million of net unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31,
2021, for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment.
see note 15 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our purchase obligations as well as amounts outstanding as of december 31, 2021 related to letters of credit and guarantees. other than the items described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2021.
in our opinion, our liquidity position provides sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable cash needs.
there can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, including refinancings, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us.

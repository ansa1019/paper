item 1a.       risk factors.
this report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity. words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as "may," "could," "will," "should," "possible," "plan," "predict," "forecast," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," "goal," "strategy" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses. in addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include the risks discussed below.
our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.
covid-19 pandemic risks the covid-19 pandemic has materially adversely affected, and could continue to materially adversely affect, our operations, supply chain, manufacturing, product distribution, customers and other business activities: the global covid-19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the market and the united states and international economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown. in response, various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented, and may continue to implement, numerous measures to contain the pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. a significant number of our customers, global suppliers, distributors and manufacturing facilities are located in regions that have been affected by the pandemic and those operations have been, and could continue to be, materially affected by restrictive measures implemented in response to the pandemic. as a result, some of our customers, distributors and indirect sales channels have at times been unable to retain employees, distribute or use our products or provide required services. any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or delay in delivering our products may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all, which could harm our reputation, future sales and profitability. for example, certain of our products contain electronic components and we have experienced, and could continue to experience, limited product availability due to the electronic components shortage in certain product lines. if the shortage persists, we may not be able to obtain electronic components from our suppliers on a timely basis, or at all, or identify any alternative suppliers to provide the electronic components we need to produce our products.
in addition, the pandemic could adversely impact our ability, and the ability of our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers, to retain key employees and ensure the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our, and their, complex operations. to the extent our management or other personnel, or the management or other personnel of our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers, are impacted in significant numbers by the pandemic and are not available to perform their job duties, we could experience delays in, or the suspension of, our manufacturing operations, sales activities, research and product development activities, regulatory work streams, clinical development programs and other important commercial and corporate functions.
dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
stryker corporation 2021 form 10-k moreover, the actions we take to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on our workforce could reduce the efficiency of our operations or prove insufficient. our relationships with our employees may be disrupted due to measures implemented in response to the covid-19 pandemic. we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market due to labor shortages caused in part by the covid-19 pandemic and responsive measures, which has included increased wages offered by other employers and voluntary attrition of our employees and the employees of our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers.
the extent of the pandemic's effect on our business and industry will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, including future resurgences and/or the spread of variants, and the successful development, distribution and acceptance of vaccines for covid-19, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. we are not able at this time to estimate with certainty the effect of these and other unforeseen factors on our business, but the adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations has been, and could in the future be, material. a prolonged impact of covid-19 also could heighten many of the other risks described in this report.
we have experienced, and may continue to experience, a significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations as market demand for certain of our products has shifted and continues to shift or as may be mandated by governmental authorities in response to the covid-19 pandemic: some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures. elective medical procedures were suspended or reduced at various times in 2020 and 2021 in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold, which negatively affected our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. it is not possible to predict whether elective medical procedures will again be suspended or reduced in the future and, to the extent individuals and customers are required to continue to de-prioritize, delay or cancel elective procedures as a result of the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.
in addition, our products in certain divisions, such as medical, have experienced, and could continue to experience, higher demand as our customers focus on treating covid-19 patients. unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products have exceeded in the past, and could exceed in the future, our capacity to meet such demand timely, which could adversely affect our customer relationships and result in negative publicity. in this regard, the accelerated development and production of products and services in an effort to address medical and other requirements as a result of the pandemic could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or related claims.
legal and regulatory risks current economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change: our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings. we are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform in the countries in which we operate as new guidance and regulations are published. in addition, further changes in the tax laws could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd). the oecd, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. these contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by oecd members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.
we could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate: we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally. accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations. income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings. income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.
the impact of united states healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain: in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act (aca) was enacted. while the provisions of the aca are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time, other provisions of the legislation, including medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business. there have been ongoing litigation and congressional efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the aca. we face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the aca, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect that any future legislation or regulation in the united states may have on our business.
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the classification, manufacturing, sterilization, labeling, marketing and sale of our products: the classification, manufacturing, sterilization, labeling, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the fda, european union, the nmpa in china, and other governmental authorities in the united states and internationally. the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and/or approvals to market and sell our products can be costly and time consuming and the clearances and/or approvals might not be granted timely. we have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system, medical device reporting regulations and other requirements. costs to comply with regulations, including the european union medical device regulation enacted by the european union in may 2017 and effective in may 2021, the free trade agreement between the united kingdom and the european union that became effective january 1, 2021, and the regulatory laws established by the nmpa in china, and costs associated with remediation can be significant. if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
stryker corporation 2021 form 10-k requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action, product seizures, recalls, the suspension of product manufacturing, revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, substantial fines and criminal prosecution.
we are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare regulations, including anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-kickback and false claims laws, globally and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws: the relationships that we, and third-parties that market and/or sell our products, have with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals, healthcare organizations and others, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. in addition, the united states and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws. we also must comply with a variety of other laws that impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals and others. these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been, and in the future could be, required to incur substantial costs to investigate, audit and monitor compliance or to alter our practices. violations of these laws could result in litigation and we may be subject to criminal or civil penalties and sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. in 2013 and 2018 we settled claims brought by the united states securities and exchange commission (sec) related to the fcpa. pursuant to these settlements, we paid fines and penalties and retained an independent compliance consultant. we continue to implement recommendations that resulted from the independent compliance consultant's review of our commercial practices to enhance our commercial business practices.
we are subject to privacy, data protection and data security regulations and laws globally, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws: we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personally identifiable healthcare information. for example, in the united states, privacy and security regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, including the expanded requirements under the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009, establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information (phi), by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of phi. further, the european union's general data protection regulation (gdpr), which became effective in may 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to european union customers and employees. the gdpr established requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of total company revenue). other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, which could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data. these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been, and in the future could be, required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices.
we may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements: we are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. we may be exposed to additional potential product liability risks related to products designed, manufactured and marketed in response to the covid-19 pandemic, including discretionary products and products permitted under the emergency use authorization granted by the fda. we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to our rejuvenate and abgii modular-neck hip stems, lfit anatomic cocr v40 femoral heads and the product liability lawsuits and claims relating to wright legacy hip products discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. these matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable. further, in november 2020 the european parliament voted in favor of the european representative actions directive (the collective redress directive), which mandates a class action regime in each member state to facilitate domestic and cross-border class actions in a wide range of areas, including product liability claims with medical devices. the collective redress directive will take effect in 2023 after a 24-month implementation period. the collective redress directive, when implemented, could result in additional litigation risks and significant legal expenses for us. in addition, we may incur significant legal expenses for product liability claims regardless of whether we are found to be liable.
intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products: the medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation. regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues. a successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.
dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios: our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. if we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio. also, our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues. in addition, currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents.
market risks we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into united states dollars: we report our financial results in united states dollars and approximately 30% of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies, including the australian dollar, british pound, canadian dollar, chinese yuan, euro and japanese yen. cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
stryker corporation 2021 form 10-k foreign currency exchange effects. while we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. in addition, the weakening or strengthening of the united states dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into united states dollars.
additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms, which could negatively affect our liquidity: our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt. our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets, including disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic. changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing. higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements. in addition, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, loss of sales and profits due to delayed payments or insolvency of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers and suppliers facing liquidity issues caused by the covid-19 pandemic. as a result, we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow, including through the reduction of operating expenses or suspension of dividend payments, at least until the consequences of the pandemic subside.
business and operational risks we are subject to cost containment measures in the united states and other countries resulting in pricing pressures: initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business. these initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing. for example, china has implemented a volume-based procurement process designed to decrease prices for medical devices and other products. this has already impacted our joint replacement business on a national level, and our trauma and spine products on a provincial level, and we expect further adoption of volume-based procurement provincially or nationally in china in 2022. pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally.
we operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant: the markets in which we compete are highly competitive. new business models, products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by us, as we continue to innovate to address physician and patient needs, or by our existing competitors and new market entrants. our existing competitors and new market entrants may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater access to clinical information to support ongoing product position in the market, have greater financial, marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.
we may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals: we seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in healthcare organizations, such as hospitals and universities, who assist in product research and development. we rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, our access to these professionals has been limited as hospitals have restricted access for non-patients, including our research and development specialists and other employees, and governmental authorities have imposed travel restrictions, shutdowns or similar measures, which has adversely affected our ability to develop, market and sell products. if we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could be further adversely affected.
we rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that are independent of stryker: in many markets, we rely on indirect distribution channels to market, distribute, and sell our products. these indirect channels often are the main point of contact for the healthcare professionals and healthcare organization customers who buy and use our products. our ability to market, distribute, and sell our products through indirect channels has been adversely affected as a result of precautionary responses to the covid-19 pandemic, including travel restrictions, suspension and shutdown orders and other measures intended to limit person-to-person contact. our ability to continue to market, distribute, and sell our products may be at risk if the indirect channels become insolvent, choose to sell competitive products, choose to stop selling medical technology, or are subject to new or additional government regulation, whether related to the covid-19 pandemic or for unrelated reasons.
we are subject to risks associated with our extensive global operations: we develop, manufacture and distribute our products globally. our global operations are subject to risks and potential costs, including changes in reimbursement, changes in regulatory requirements, differing local product preferences and product requirements, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries, tariffs and other trade protection measures, international trade disputes and import or export requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations, introduction of new internal business structures and programs, political and economic instability, such as the united kingdom's exit from the european union (brexit), and disruptions of transportation due to a global pandemic of contagious diseases like covid-19 or otherwise, such as reduced availability of transportation, port closures, increased border controls or closures, increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain. our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations in an increasingly volatile environment.
we may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions: in addition to internally developed products, we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions, including our pending acquisition of vocera communications, inc. such investments are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us. the risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses, diversion of dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
stryker corporation 2021 form 10-k management time that could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel, litigation resulting from the acquisition and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies. in addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable.
we could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers: we rely extensively on information technology (it) systems to conduct business. in addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, cloud and saas solutions, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software (including open source software) and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats have posed, and will continue to pose, risks to the security of our it systems, networks and product offerings, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. some of our products and services, and information technology systems, contain or use open source software, which poses particular risks, including potential security vulnerabilities, licensing compliance issues and quality issues. a security breach, whether of our products, of our customers' network security and systems or of third-party hosting services, could impact the use of such products and the security of information stored therein. while we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. in addition, a greater number of our employees working remotely during the covid-19 pandemic has exposed us, and may continue to expose us, to greater risks related to cybersecurity and cyber-liability. if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.
an inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new commercial global enterprise resource planning (erp) system could adversely affect our operations and operating results: we are in the process of implementing a new commercial global erp system. this system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems. such an implementation is a major undertaking, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.
we may be unable to attract and retain key employees: our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products. if we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force in our highly competitive industry, or if we are unable to plan effective succession for the future, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives. in addition, if we are unable to maintain an inclusive culture that aligns our diverse work force with our mission and values, this could adversely impact our ability to recruit, hire, develop and retain key talent. further, the ongoing remote work environment in response to covid-19 could harm our culture and/or decrease employee engagement, which could adversely impact our ability to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force.
interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business: we and our suppliers have manufacturing and supply sites all over the world; however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants or geographic regions. we have principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the united states in arizona, california, florida, illinois, indiana, michigan, minnesota, new jersey, tennessee, texas, utah, virginia and washington, and outside the united states in china, france, germany, ireland, mexico, the netherlands, puerto rico, switzerland and turkey. damage to our facilities, to our suppliers' or service providers' facilities, or to our central distribution centers as a result of natural disasters, fires, explosions or otherwise, as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation, equipment breakdown or malfunction, it system failures or cybersecurity incidents, environmental hazard incidents or changes to environmental regulations or other factors, could adversely affect the availability of our products. in the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand. in the event of a significant interruption, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals, and we may experience loss of market share, additional expense and harm to our reputation.
we use a variety of raw materials, components, devices and third-party services in our global supply chains, production and distribution processes; significant shortages, price increases or unavailability of third-party services could increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the competitive position of our products: our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials, components and finished devices, and on certain third-party service providers, such as sterilization service providers, exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices, whether due to inflationary pressure, regulatory changes or otherwise. in addition, several raw materials, components, finished devices and services are procured from a sole-source due to the quality considerations, unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements. if sole-source suppliers or service providers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials or services, we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer. in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or service providers for such services in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of fda and other regulations that require, among other things, validation of materials, components and services prior to their use in or with our products. in addition, dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
stryker corporation 2021 form 10-k during 2021, the market experienced increasing inflationary pressures in part due to global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and other impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, which we anticipate will continue in 2022. we may experience inflationary increases in manufacturing costs and operating expenses, caused by the covid-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, and may not be able to pass these cost increases on to our customers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.
our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses: we maintain third-party insurance to cover our exposure to certain property and casualty losses and are self-insured for claims and expenses related to other property and casualty losses, including product liability, intellectual property infringement and enforcement, environmental, and cybersecurity and data privacy losses. we manage a portion of our exposure to self-insured losses through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. insurance coverage limits provided by third-party insurers and/or our captive insurance company may not be sufficient to fully cover unanticipated losses.
environmental, social and governance (esg) risks we could be negatively impacted by esg and sustainability-related matters: governments, investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on corporate esg practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving. on occasion, we announce new initiatives, including goals, under our corporate responsibility framework. this framework is aligned with our areas of interest, which include environment and sustainability, social impact, diversity, equity and inclusion and supply chain management, among others. the criteria by which our esg practices are assessed may change due to the quickly evolving landscape, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. moreover, the increasing attention to corporate esg initiatives could also result in reduced demand for products, reduced profits and increased investigations and litigation. if we are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our policies and/or actions with respect to esg matters are inadequate. if we fail or are perceived to have failed to achieve previously announced initiatives or goals or to accurately disclose our progress on such initiatives or goals, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
physical effects of climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures intended to address climate change could adversely affect our operations and operating results: risks associated with climate change are subject to increasing societal, regulatory and political focus in the united states and globally. shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, extreme temperatures or flooding, which could cause more significant business and supply chain interruptions, damage to our products and facilities as well as the infrastructure of hospitals, medical care facilities and other customers, reduced workforce availability, increased costs of raw materials and components, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues than what we have experienced in the past from such events. in addition, increased public concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change, which could include the adoption of more stringent environmental laws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations. such developments could result in increased compliance costs and adverse impacts on raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products, which could adversely affect our operations and operating results.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
about stryker stryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies and, together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better. we offer innovative products and services in medical and surgical, neurotechnology, orthopaedics and spine that help improve patient and hospital outcomes. our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (medtech) industry and maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy that prioritizes: (1) acquisitions, (2) dividends and (3) share repurchases.
covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the market and the global and united states economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown. in response, various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented numerous measures to contain the pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. a significant number of our customers, global suppliers, vendors, distributors and manufacturing facilities are located in regions that have been affected by the pandemic. those operations have been materially adversely affected by restrictive government and private enterprise measures implemented in response to the pandemic.
some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures. elective medical procedures were suspended in the first quarter of 2020 in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold, which negatively affected our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations through the first quarter of 2021. in the second quarter of 2021 we saw partial recovery of elective procedures in most geographies; however, in the third quarter of 2021 we saw hospitalization rates increase, especially in the united states, as a result of the delta variant. this, along with the omicron variant, has continued to adversely impact elective procedures and increased inflationary pressure on our gross margin, including an increase in freight and transportation costs as well as increased absenteeism in the fourth quarter of 2021.
overview of 2021
in 2021 we achieved reported net sales growth of 19.2%. excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales grew 12.6% in constant currency. we reported net earnings of $1,994 and net earnings per diluted share of $5.21. excluding the impact of certain items, we achieved adjusted net earnings(1) of $3,474
and adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $9.09 representing growth of 22.3%.
effective december 31, 2021 we changed our reportable business segments to (i) medsurg and neurotechnology and (ii) orthopaedics and spine to align to our new internal reporting structure. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
we continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $339 in acquisitions and paying $950 in dividends to our shareholders.
in 2021 we had total long-term debt repayments of $1,151. in october 2021 we entered into a new revolving credit agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated august 19, 2016. refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
in 2021 we completed acquisitions for total net cash consideration of $339 and $54 in future milestone payments primarily due upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. in september 2021 we completed the acquisition of gauss surgical, inc. (gauss) for $120 in cash and up to $40 in future milestone payments. gauss is a medical device company that has developed triton, an artificial intelligence-enabled platform for real-time monitoring of blood loss during surgery. gauss is part of our instruments business within medsurg and neurotechnology. in january 2022 we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of vocera communications, inc. (vocera) for $79.25 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.1 billion (including convertible notes). refer to note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
in 2021 we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our authorized repurchase program. the total dollar value of shares of our common stock that could be acquired under our authorized repurchase program was $1,033 as of december 31, 2021.
in 2021 we recorded asset impairments of $264, $105 for certain long-lived and intangible assets related to the china volume-based procurement program and the remaining consisting primarily of in-process research and development, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as a result of covid-19-related demand impacts on in-process product development and certain other divestiture and restructuring activities. refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

non-gaap financial measures we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (gaap) with certain non-gaap financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research, development and engineering expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; adjusted net earnings per diluted share (diluted eps); free cash flow; and free cash flow conversion. we believe these non-gaap financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. management uses these non-gaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-gaap financial measures. to measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. to measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. to measure free cash flow, we adjust cash provided by operating activities by the amount of purchases of property, plant and equipment and proceeds from long-lived asset disposals and remove the impact of certain legal settlements and recall payments. to measure free cash flow conversion we divide free cash flow by adjusted net earnings. these adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
stryker corporation 2021 form 10-k indicative of our past and future performance. the following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:
1.acquisition and integration-related costs. costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses (e.g., costs associated with the termination of sales relationships, workforce reductions and other integration-related activities) and specific costs (e.g., inventory step-up and deal costs) related to the consummation of the acquisition process.
2.amortization of purchased intangible assets. periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets.
3.restructuring-related and other charges. costs associated with the termination of sales relationships in certain countries, workforce reductions, elimination of product lines, certain long-lived and intangible asset impairments and associated costs and other restructuring-related activities.
4.medical device regulations. costs specific to updating our quality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product remanufacturing to comply with the new medical device reporting regulations and other requirements of the european union and the more stringent regulations for medical devices in china.
5.recall-related matters. our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the rejuvenate, lfit v40 and other product recalls.
6.regulatory and legal matters. our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements.
7.tax matters. charges represent the impact of accounting for certain significant and discrete tax items.
because non-gaap financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-gaap financial measures having the same or similar names. these adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures at the end of the discussion of consolidated results of operations below. we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates despite the covid-19 pandemic. operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. we supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary. our overall cash position reflects our business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $3,263, $3,277 and $2,191 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. the slight decrease from 2020 was primarily due to higher accounts receivable, partially offset by increased net earnings and accounts payable.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $859, $4,701 and $1,455 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. the decrease in cash used in 2021 was primarily due to decreased payments for acquisitions and certain other businesses and related assets. in 2020 we acquired wright, while in 2019 we acquired mobius imaging and cardan robotics and certain other businesses and related assets.
financing activities cash provided by (used in) financing activities was ($2,365), ($11) and $3 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by long-term debt repayments of $1,151 and dividend payments of $950 in 2021. in 2020 we secured a $400 term loan in november, issued $600 of notes in november and $2,300 of notes in june, which was offset by total debt repayments of $2,297 and dividend payments of $863. there were no share repurchases in 2021 or 2020.
we maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital. refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

liquidity cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $3,019 and $3,024, and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $5,468 and $4,666 on december 31, 2021 and 2020. we anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. in october 2021 we entered into a new revolving credit agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated august 19, 2016. the primary changes were to increase the aggregate principal amount of the facility by $750 to $2,250, extend the maturity date to october 26, 2026, increase the leverage ratio to 3.75 and provide libor replacement language.
we raised funds in the capital markets in 2020 and 2019 and may continue to do so from time-to-time. we continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.
our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the united states was approximately 26% and 30% on december 31, 2021 and 2020. we intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions.
guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
contractual obligations and forward-looking cash requirements as further described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, in 2021 we recorded charges to earnings related to the rejuvenate and abg ii and lfit anatomic cocr v40 femoral heads recall matters and recorded product liabilities relating to wright legacy hip products claims. recorded reserves represent the minimum of the range of probable cost remaining to resolve these matters. the final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. the ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different from the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.
as further described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, on december 31, 2021 we had a reserve for dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
stryker corporation 2021 form 10-k uncertain income tax positions of $444. due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.
as further described in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, on december 31, 2021 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $493, of which approximately $491 related to plans outside the united states. due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.

critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, there are certain accounting policies, which may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. we believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. if actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
income taxes our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. in certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. these differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.
acquisitions, goodwill and intangibles, and long-lived assets our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. in addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. with the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
stryker corporation 2021 form 10-k brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.
in some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (iprd) intangible assets. for acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, iprd is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired). for asset acquisitions, iprd is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use.
the value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. we consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill and periodically corroborate that assessment with quantitative information. in certain circumstances, we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the carrying value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. we test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual carrying values compared to the fair value. we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values significantly exceeded their respective recorded values. future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.
we review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
legal and other contingencies we are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. in certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. for legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. the estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. if actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. we are currently self-insured for certain claims and expenses. the ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

item 1a. risk factors these risks, which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
business & operational risk factors the outbreak of the covid-19 global pandemic and associated responses has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations.
the covid-19 pandemic has negatively affected many parts of our business and operations. the extent that the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact general economic conditions and our business, operations and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak and additional variants, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the distribution and efficacy of vaccines and the speed of critical mass adoption of available vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.
we have experienced, and may experience in the future, slowdowns and temporary idling of certain of our production facilities due to a number of covid-19 related factors, including implementing additional safety measures, testing of our team members, team member absenteeism, and governmental orders. during fiscal 2021, we experienced slowdowns at our production facilities. we anticipate we may experience additional volatility in our ability to operate our facilities at full utilization rates, depending on the factors detailed above. the idling and slowdowns impacted our results of operations for fiscal 2021, and additional or prolonged idling of facilities or an extended period of operating at a reduced capacity or more significant reductions in our operations at our facilities could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate our business and on our results of operations.
we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, an increase in operating costs in connection with higher costs associated with ensuring the continued health and safety of team members including regular temperature checks, providing additional personal protective equipment and deep cleaning facilities. during fiscal 2021, we incurred direct incremental expenses related to covid-19 totaling approximately $335 million, which primarily included team member costs associated with worker health and availability, including direct costs for personal protection equipment, production facility sanitization, covid-19 testing and vaccinations, donations, product downgrades, rendered product and certain professional fees, partially offset by the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act (the "cares act") credits. there can be no assurance that the health and safety measures we have taken (which include adding temperature and symptom screening stations for employees prior to entering our facilities, increasing physical distancing of our employees and requiring the vaccination of team members) will eradicate the risks associated with working in a critical infrastructure industry, including but not limited to, infection of our employees or the temporary closure of a facility. further, there can be no assurance that we will not incur additional direct incremental expenses related to covid-19 going forward, and that such amounts will not be material or have a material impact on our business, cash flows or results of operations.
workforce limitations and travel restrictions resulting from covid-19 and related government actions adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, many aspects of our business. a number of our team members at various facilities have tested positive for covid-19. these team members, and in some cases those working in close contact with diagnosed persons, are required to be quarantined, which has led to a decrease in our available workforce in various locations. the decrease in our available workforce has at times adversely impacted our ability to operate our business effectively. if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness, travel or government restrictions in connection with covid-19, this could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations. in addition, certain of our team members who claim to have tested positive for covid-19, or their family members, have filed lawsuits seeking compensatory and punitive damages for wrongful death and personal injury claims in several states. we expect additional team members or family members of team members may assert similar claims as the covid-19 pandemic continues. if we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims, we may experience significant losses and expenses in connection with these lawsuits, which could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
we have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, disruption and volatility in our supply chain, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs for certain raw materials, packaging materials and transportation costs. the spread of covid-19 has also disrupted and may continue to disrupt logistics necessary to import, export and deliver products to us and our customers. ports and other channels of entry have been closed or operating at only a portion of capacity and means of transporting products within regions or countries may be limited for the same reason. other supply chain risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic include but are not limited to shutdowns or reduced operations at our suppliers' facilities, the continued inability of some of our contract producers to manage their livestock, supply chain disruptions for feed grains, changes in consumer orders due to shifting consumer patterns, changes in livestock and protein market prices, and additional disruptions in logistics or the distribution chain for our products ,the occurrence of any of which may result in a reduction in our fill rates to our customers. in addition, our operations, or those of independent contract poultry producers and producers who provide the live animals to our production operations, may become more limited in their ability to procure, deliver, or produce our food products because of transport restrictions related to quarantines or travel bans and the closure of certain of our production facilities.
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, each of our segments experienced a shift in demand from foodservice to retail during 2020. while each of our segments has subsequently experienced varying levels of foodservice recovery and the return of volumes during fiscal 2021, the long-term impact of covid-19 remains uncertain and will depend on a number of future developments which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. in addition, in the event of a protracted period of economic downturn, demand for our foodservice products may remain below expectations or decrease further, and demand for our retail consumption products may also decrease, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
governmental authorities at the federal, state and local levels may increase or impose new or stricter social distancing directives, stay-at-home restrictions, travel bans, quarantines, workforce and workplace restrictions or other measures related to covid-19 variants and resurgences, including any variants such as the delta variant. such actions could cause us to continue to incur additional costs.
we also face other risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic, including:
•additional increase in input cost may not be adequately captured through pricing;
•an increase in consumer demand in our retail channel, such as grocery stores, club stores and value stores, which has and may continue to strain our supply chain;
•an increase in working capital needs and/or an increase in trade accounts receivable write-offs (and associated reserves) as a result of increased financial pressures on our suppliers or customers who are not able to pay in a timely manner or at all;
•adverse changes to the global economy may subject us to risk of material intangible and long-lived asset impairments, adjustments for inventory and market volatility for items subject to fair value measurements such as derivatives and investments;
•an inability to effectively implement our marketing and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer shopping habits due to, among other things, reduced in-person shopping and travel restrictions;
•a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn, which could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products; and
•litigation.
the severity and duration of the current covid-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response are unknown and are impossible to predict with certainty. any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
we may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of our financial excellence programs, which may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected.
in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the company approved a restructuring program (the "2020 program"), which is expected to contribute to the company's overall strategy of financial fitness through the elimination of overhead and consolidation of certain enterprise functions. for more information regarding this program, refer to part ii, item 8. notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 7: restructuring and related charges. beginning in fiscal 2022, we are launching a new productivity program, which is designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision making.
the success of the financial excellence programs, or future financial excellence programs, including the realization of the anticipated benefits, will depend in part on our ability to successfully implement the programs in an efficient and effective manner. the implementation of the financial excellence programs may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the financial excellence programs may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits. if we are unable to implement the financial excellence programs smoothly or successfully, or we otherwise do not capture the anticipated savings, our business, results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted.
in addition, we may incur higher costs associated with reductions in overhead than anticipated, and the reduction in overhead could result in performance shortfalls. the financial excellence programs may become a distraction for our organization and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in team member morale; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and result in negative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation. if we are unable to successfully manage the negative consequences of the financial excellence programs, our business, results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be adversely affected.
we are subject to risks associated with our international activities, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign locations, as well as our operations and assets in such locations.
in fiscal 2021, we sold products to customers in approximately 140 countries. major sales markets include australia, canada, central america, chile, china, the european union, the united kingdom, japan, mexico, malaysia, the middle east, south korea, taiwan and thailand. our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2021 totaled $7.0 billion of which $4.9 billion related to export sales from the united states. in addition, we had approximately $1,369 million of long-lived assets located in foreign locations, primarily brazil, china, the european union, new zealand and thailand, at the end of fiscal 2021.
as a result, we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:
•the ongoing impact of covid-19, including any resurgence and variants such as the delta variant, on the global economy and on consumer demand worldwide; imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by foreign countries regarding the importation of beef, pork, poultry and prepared foods products, in addition to import or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries;
•closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of beef, pork and poultry products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;
•impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the brazilian real, the british pound sterling, the canadian dollar, the chinese renminbi, the european euro, the japanese yen, the thai baht, the malaysian ringgit and the mexican peso;
•political and economic conditions;
•difficulties and costs to comply with, and enforcement of remedies under, a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws, treaties and regulations, including, without limitation, the united states foreign corrupt practices act and economic and trade sanctions enforced by the united states department of the treasury's office of foreign assets control;
•different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments;
•tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;
•potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and
•distribution costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation.
negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results.
our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber-attacks, other cyber incidents or security breaches or if our information technology systems are otherwise disrupted.
information technology is an important part of our business operations and we rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes. we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. in addition, we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers. like other companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues. in addition, such incidents could result in unauthorized or accidental disclosure of material confidential information or regulated individual personal data. attempted cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise.
although we have in the past experienced, and may in the future face, cyber attacks, other cyber incidents or security breaches, we have not experienced anything significant in the current year. we have implemented and continue to evaluate security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks, but these measures may not be adequate. any significant failure of our systems, including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended or our failure to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents, could cause transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers and sales, have negative consequences on our team members and our business partners, have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation and expose us to liability, litigation and regulatory enforcement actions. in addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our business partners, customers, consumers or suppliers. finally, the disclosure of non-public information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image. similar risks exist with respect to the third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors.
we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable strategic acquisitions or divestitures or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures and other initiatives, and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies, processing plants, technologies, products and services. acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties, including:
•challenges in realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction;
•difficulty integrating acquired businesses, technologies, operations and personnel with our existing business;
•diversion of management attention in connection with negotiating transactions and integrating the businesses acquired;
•difficulty identifying suitable candidates;
•consummating a transaction on terms that are favorable to us;
•challenges in retaining the acquired businesses' customers and key team members;
•inability to implement and maintain consistent standards, controls, procedures and information systems;
•exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies; and
•the availability and terms of additional debt or equity financing for any transaction.
we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units. if we are unable to do this, such expansion could adversely affect our financial results. additionally, from time to time, we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us. gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may affect our profitability and margins. moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability. our divestiture activities may present financial, managerial and operational risks. those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems, possible need for providing transition services to buyers, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers. any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control.
as of october 2, 2021, tyson limited partnership (the "tlp") owns 99.985% of the outstanding shares of the company's class b common stock, $0.10 par value ("class b stock") and the tlp and members of the tyson family own, in the aggregate, 2.28% of the outstanding shares of the company's class a common stock, $0.10 par value ("class a stock"), giving them, collectively, control of approximately 71.04% of the total voting power of the company's outstanding voting stock. at this time, the tlp does not have a managing general partner, as such, the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners. as of october 2, 2021, mr. john tyson, chairman of the board of directors, has 33.33% of the general partner percentage interests, and ms. barbara tyson, a director of the company, has 11.115% general partner percentage interests (the remaining general partnership interests are held by the donald j. tyson revocable trust (44.44%) and harry c. erwin, iii (11.115%)). as a result of these holdings, positions and directorships, the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price. additionally, as a result of the tlp's significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock, we are eligible for "controlled company" exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange.
industry risk factors fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials, especially feed grains, live cattle, live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings.
our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the selling prices for our products, are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as beef, pork, poultry, corn, soybean meal, packaging materials and energy and, to a lesser extent, cheese, fruit, seasoning blends, flour, corn syrup, corn oils, butter and sugar. corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients, for instance, represented roughly 59% of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2021.
production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control. such factors include, among other things, weather patterns throughout the world, outbreaks of disease, the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients, as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments.
volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability. the company's objective is to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time. however, we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors. in addition, if we increase prices to offset higher costs, we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes. conversely, decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices. while we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices.
over time, if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program, then commodity and raw material price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and results of operations.
the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors.
the food industry in general is intensely competitive. we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach. some of the factors on which we compete include: pricing, product safety and quality, brand identification, innovation, breadth and depth of product offerings, availability of our products (including distribution channels used, such as e-commerce) and competing products, customer service, and credit terms.
from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share, we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing, advertising and promotions and new product innovation. such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases. any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures, or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases, could harm our profit margins. if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes, then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer. alternatively, if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected.
outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and the supply and demand for our products.
supply of and demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases, which can have a significant impact on our financial results. efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock. however, outbreaks of disease and other events, which may be beyond our control, either in our own livestock or livestock owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us, could significantly affect demand for our products, consumer perceptions of certain protein products, the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations. moreover, the outbreak of livestock diseases, particularly in our chicken segment, could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to, among other things, destroy any affected livestock. furthermore, an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers, facilities or customers. this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results.
changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business.
the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. trends within the food industry change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products. we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, but we may not be successful in our efforts.
we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
we have a number of iconic brands with significant value. maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers.
failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results.
our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences, purchasing behaviors and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want in the channels where they shop. we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions, however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify, develop, manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, our financial results and our competitive position will suffer. in addition, our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights, which could negatively impact our results of operations.
we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments, including advertising, consumer promotions and trade spend. due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising, promotions and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. continuing global focus on health and wellness, including weight management, and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices.
our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image.
we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products, for instance marketing to children, which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image. if we do not maintain or extend our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business.
our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers' plans and/or markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers, including, for example, walmart inc., which accounted for 18.3% of our sales in fiscal 2021. our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts, and if they do sign contracts, they generally are limited in scope and duration. there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. alternative retail channels, such as convenience stores, dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and internet-based retailers have increased their market share.
this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted. many of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years, and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets. these consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories, opposing price increases, and demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products. these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products. because of these trends, our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products. the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to, or adverse change to trade terms with, a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products, especially during economic downturn, may adversely affect our profitability.
in many product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices. consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives. if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows, or if there is a perception of such a narrowing, consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us. in addition, in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more lower-priced private label or other economy brands. to the extent this occurs, we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. in addition, in times of economic uncertainty, consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers, which in turn reduces our product sales.
labor & employment risk factors labor shortages and increased turnover or increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.
we have recently experienced increased labor shortages at some of our production facilities and other locations. while we have historically experienced some level of ordinary course turnover of employees, the covid-19 pandemic and resulting actions and impacts have exacerbated labor shortages and increased turnover. a number of factors have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the labor force available to us, including reduced employment pools, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the covid-19 pandemic, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers' health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. labor shortages and increased turnover rates within our team members have led to and could in the future lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our production facilities or otherwise operate at full capacity. an overall or prolonged labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.
we depend on the availability of, and good relations with, our team members and their labor unions.
we have approximately 137,000 team members, approximately 38,000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions. our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with team members and the labor unions. if we fail to maintain good relations with our team members or with the labor unions, we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages, which could adversely affect our financial results.
if we are unable to attract, hire or retain key team members or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our continued growth requires us to attract, hire, retain and develop key team members, including our executive officers and senior management team, and maintain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce. we compete to attract and hire highly skilled team members and our own team members are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies. competition could cause us to lose talented team members, and unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for team members. in addition, our compensation arrangements may not always be successful in attracting new employees or retaining our existing team members.
we depend on contract farmers and independent producers to supply us with livestock.
we contract primarily with independent contract farmers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations. a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market. if we do not attract and maintain contracts with farmers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers, our production operations could be negatively affected. certain of our competitors may also negotiate more favorable contract terms that could provide them with competitive advantages and affect our supply.
legal & regulatory risk factors if our products become contaminated, we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could adversely affect our financial results and damage our reputation.
our products may be subject to contamination by foreign materials or disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes, salmonella and e. coli. these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more, as a result of food processing, could be present in our products. these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further-processing, foodservice or consumer level. these risks may be controlled, but may not be eliminated, by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing. we have little, if any, control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, increased scrutiny and penalties, including injunctive relief and plant closings, by federal and state regulatory agencies, and adverse publicity, which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction. any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results. in addition, we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil, become contaminated, are tampered with or are mislabeled. a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.
new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products. see "environmental regulation and food safety" in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information. changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us (including the united kingdom's exit from the european union) could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. for example, increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices.
increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, as well as alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives (including those related to single use plastics), may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us. we use natural gas, diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability.
climate change and legal or regulatory responses may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
global average temperatures are gradually increasing due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which may contribute to significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities and natural resources, as well as raw materials such as beef, pork, poultry, corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients, which are important sources of ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the world. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. increasing concern over climate change also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer preferences and result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. in addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures. increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements could be prohibitively costly and may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the running of our production facilities. furthermore, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations and strategy, which will likely incur substantial time, attention and costs. even if we make changes to align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant fines if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. the effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. finally, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint. if we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon emissions reduction goals and commitments, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our products.
the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations.
our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. compliance with these laws and regulations, and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations, is material to our business. new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation, assessment, or expenditures. in addition, some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous. future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses. the occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our financial results.
legal claims, class action lawsuits, other regulatory enforcement actions, or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales, reputation and profitability.
we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. consequently, we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our team members, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies and procedures. moreover, a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those contained in item 3, legal proceedings and part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 21: commitments and contingencies in this annual report on form 10-k, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, including debarment from governmental contracts that could materially and adversely affect our product sales, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results.
financial risk factors our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position.
our indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, may increase from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, working capital needs, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions, joint ventures or other significant initiatives. our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because:
•it may limit or impair our ability to obtain financing in the future;
•our credit ratings (or any decrease to our credit ratings) could restrict or impede our ability to access capital markets at desired interest rates and increase our borrowing costs;
•it may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;
•a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; and
•it may restrict our ability to pay dividends.
our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. in addition, we are required to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio.
our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates, ebitda multiples, and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors. goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using income and market approaches. the income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. the market approach measures value based on what other purchasers in the market have paid for assets or business interests that can be considered reasonably similar to each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relief-from-royalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. under these valuation approaches, we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates, amongst other assumptions. disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions, could, among other things, cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations. we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines. these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future, which could be substantial. as of october 2, 2021, we had $14.6 billion of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which represented approximately 40% of total assets.
participation in a multiemployer pension plan could adversely affect our business.
we participate in a "multiemployer" pension plan that provides defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements. these type of plans are typically administered by boards of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives. we are required to make periodic contributions to this plan to allow the plan to meet its pension benefit obligation to its participants. our required contributions to this fund could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to this fund, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. in the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan, then applicable law could require us to make additional lump-sum contributions to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. the plan in which we participate is reported to have a significant underfunded liability. such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal was to occur with respect to the multiemployer plan, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material.
volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans.
we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for team members in the united states. the difference between plan obligations and assets, which signifies the funded status of the plans, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements. as of october 2, 2021, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of $215 million, as compared to an underfunded position of $234 million at the end of fiscal 2020. changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements.
market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions.
our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. we hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures, that are not hedges for financial reporting purposes. these positions are marked to fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. therefore, losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results. while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices.
general risk factors deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business.
our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, access to capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products, or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials, cooking ingredients and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results.
disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could, among other things:
•make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future;
•cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any amendment of, or waivers under, our credit agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future;
•impair the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers, thereby increasing customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers;
•negatively impact global demand for protein products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows;
•decrease the value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including our marketable debt securities, company-owned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets;
•negatively impact our commodity purchasing activities if we are required to record losses related to derivative financial instruments; or
•impair the financial viability of our insurers.
extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business.
our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. natural disasters, fire, bioterrorism, pandemic or extreme weather, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, decrease in availability of water, damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels or unfavorably impact the demand for, or our consumers' ability to purchase our products, among other things. any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness.
we consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our trade secrets, patents and copyrights, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions.
we cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. in addition, even if such rights are obtained in the united states, the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.

overview covid-19
we continue to monitor and respond to the evolving nature of the covid-19 pandemic and its impact to our global business. in addition to our ongoing internal covid-19 task force formed for the primary purposes of maintaining the health and safety of our team members, ensuring our ability to operate our processing facilities and maintaining the liquidity of our business, we have expanded our medical team with the addition of a chief medical officer during fiscal 2021. we have experienced and continue to experience multiple challenges related to the pandemic. these challenges increased our operating costs during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. operationally, we experienced slowdowns and temporary idling of production facilities due to team member absenteeism and choices we made to ensure team member health and safety. each of our segments experienced a shift in demand from foodservice to retail during 2020 and have seen varying levels of foodservice recovery and the return of volumes during fiscal 2021. the long-term impact of covid-19 remains uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, covid-19 variants and resurgences, and related actions taken by federal, state and local government officials to prevent and manage disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. additionally, we continue to assess the potential of more permanent impacts to our businesses.
team members the health and safety of our team members is our top priority. to protect our team members, we implement safety measures recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention ("cdc") and the occupational safety and health administration ("osha") in our facilities and coordinate with other health officials as appropriate. in addition to hiring a chief medical officer, we have added 200 nurse and administrative support staff positions and developed an "always-on" testing strategy rooted in contact tracing. in august 2021, we announced all domestic team members were required to be fully vaccinated by november 1, 2021.
customers and production our most significant impacts from covid-19 relate to channel shifts and lower production. we are committed to doing our best to ensure the continuity of our business and the availability of our products to customers. our production capabilities, including our large scale and geographic proximities, allow us to adapt some of our facilities to the changing demand. in addition, our production facilities experienced varying levels of production impacts, including reduced volumes, due to the implementation of additional worker health precautions and worker absenteeism.
supply chain our supply chain has stayed largely intact as we have built contingency plans for redundant supply for our production facilities as well as our external suppliers. we have been able to leverage our extensive distribution network and large private transportation fleet to help mitigate the impacts of covid-19. we have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in commodity inputs, which has impacted our input costs, in part due to impacts caused by covid-19. since we also export globally, container availability and port capacities have been among the challenges in meeting the global demand for our products.
insurance and cares act although we maintain insurance policies for various risks, we do not believe most covid-19 impacts will be covered by our policies. the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act (the "cares act"), among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of the employer portion of social security payments, and a number of income tax provisions. the provisions related to income tax will not have a significant impact on our financial statements.
overall financial condition we continue to proactively manage the company and its operations through the pandemic. the major challenge we face is the availability of team members to operate our production facilities due to our production facilities experiencing varying levels of absenteeism and due to labor shortages associated with the economic impact of the pandemic. we will continue to operate our production facilities with team member health and safety as a top priority. however, we cannot predict the ultimate impact that covid-19 will have on our short- and long-term demand at this time, as it will depend on, among other things, the severity and duration of the covid-19 pandemic. we generated $3.8 billion of operating cash flows during fiscal 2021. at october 2, 2021, we had $4.8 billion of liquidity, which included availability under our revolving credit facility and $2.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents. we have $1.1 billion of current debt. combined with the cash expected to be generated from the company's operations, we anticipate that we will maintain sufficient liquidity to operate our business, make capital expenditures, pay dividends and address other needs including our ability to meet maturing debt obligations.
fiscal year our accounting cycle resulted in a 52-week year for both fiscal 2021 and 2019 and a 53-week year for fiscal 2020.
general sales grew 9% in fiscal 2021 over fiscal 2020 to $47.0 billion, primarily due to increased average sales prices in each of our segments, partially offset by the impact of an additional week in fiscal 2020. fiscal 2021 operating income increased compared to fiscal 2020, as strong beef results and the gain on the sale of our pet treats business were partially offset by a decline in operating income in the chicken and pork segments. in fiscal 2021, our results were impacted by $626 million of charges related to legal contingency accruals, $27 million of charges related to the relocation of a production facility in china, $17 million of production facilities fire costs, net of insurance proceeds and a $784 million gain on the sale of our pet treats business. in fiscal 2020, our results were impacted by $77 million of restructuring and related charges offset by the positive impact of the additional week.
during fiscal 2021, we incurred direct incremental expenses related to covid-19 totaling approximately $335 million, which were recorded in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. during fiscal 2020, we incurred direct incremental expenses related to covid-19 totaling approximately $540 million, of which approximately $500 million and $40 million were recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative, respectively, in our consolidated statements of income. these covid-19 direct incremental expenses in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 primarily included team member costs associated with worker health and availability and production facility downtime, including direct costs for personal protection equipment, production facility sanitization, covid-19 testing and vaccinations, donations, product downgrades, rendered product, certain professional fees and $114 million of thank you bonuses to frontline team members in fiscal 2020, which was partially offset by the cares act credits. due to the nature of these direct incremental covid-19 expenses, our segments were primarily impacted based on their relative number of team members, absenteeism and the degree of production disruptions they have experienced, and thus, our beef and chicken segments incurred a greater proportion of the total costs. these direct incremental covid-19 related costs exclude market related impacts that may have been driven in part by covid-19, including such items as derivatives, deferred compensation investments and other market driven impacts to margin and demand. other indirect costs associated with covid-19 are not reflected in these amounts, including costs associated with raw materials, distribution and transportation, plant underutilization and reconfiguration, premiums paid to cattle producers, and pricing discounts.
market environment according to the usda, domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) was relatively flat in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. we continue to monitor trade and tariff activity as well as covid-19 and its potential impacts to exports and input costs across all of our segments. additionally, all segments experienced increased operating costs in fiscal 2021. we will pursue recovery of these increased costs through pricing. the beef segment experienced strong global demand and ample supply of market-ready cattle. the pork segment experienced strong demand and lower hog supplies. the chicken segment experienced strong demand relative to supply. the prepared foods segment experienced growth, but faced increased costs partially due to the impact of an inflationary environment and challenging labor and supply conditions during fiscal 2021.
margins our total operating margin was 9.3% in fiscal 2021. operating margins by segment were as follows:
•beef - 18.0%
•pork - 5.2%
•chicken - (4.6)%
•prepared foods - 16.4%
strategy our strategy is to sustainably feed the world with the fastest growing protein brands. we intend to achieve our strategy as we: grow our business by delivering superior value to consumers and customers; deliver fuel for growth and returns through commercial, operational and financial excellence; and sustain our company and our world for future generations.
•in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated a plan to sell our pet treats business, which is included in our prepared foods segment. in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business for $1.2 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. the business had a net carrying value of approximately $411 million as of july 6, 2021, which included approximately $44 million of working capital consisting of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, $17 million of property, plant and equipment and $350 million of goodwill. the transaction closed on july 6, 2021, and we recognized a gain of $784 million from the sale of this business, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2021.
•beginning in fiscal 2022, we are launching a new productivity program, which is designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision making. we are targeting $1 billion in productivity savings by fiscal 2024, relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline. the execution of this program will be supported by a program management office that will ensure delivery of key project milestones and report on savings achievements connected with the three pillars of the program. the first pillar is operational and functional excellence, which includes functional efficiency efforts in finance, hr and procurement focused on applying best practices to reduce costs. the second pillar is the use of new digital solutions like artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to drive efficiency in operations, supply chain planning, logistics and warehousing. the third pillar is automation, which will leverage automation and robotics technologies to automate difficult and higher turnover positions. at this time, we do not anticipate costs associated with this program to be material.

2021 vs. 2020 -
•sales volume - sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in sales volume across each of our segments, which accounted for a decrease of $1,190 million, due in part to the impacts of a challenging labor environment as well as the impact of an additional week in fiscal 2020.
•average sales price - sales were positively impacted by higher average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of $5,599 million. the increase in average sales price was primarily attributable to favorable product mix and the pass through of increased raw material costs.
•the above change in average sales price for fiscal 2021 excludes a $545 million reduction of sales from the recognition of legal contingency accruals.
2020 vs. 2019 -
•sales volume - sales were positively impacted by an increase in sales volume, which accounted for an increase of $278 million primarily due to incremental volumes from business acquisitions as well as the impact of an additional week in fiscal 2020, partially offset by decreased volumes in each of our segments in fiscal 2020 due to lower production throughput associated with the impact of covid-19.
•average sales price - sales were positively impacted by higher average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of $502 million. the increase in average sales price was primarily attributable to favorable product mix related to robust demand in the retail channel across all of our segments and beef and pork demand remaining strong amid supply disruptions related to covid-19, partially offset by approximately $45 million of incremental discounted sales in the prepared foods segment.

liquidity and capital resources our cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, repurchases of senior notes, repayment of maturing debt, the payment of dividends and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand, cash flows provided by operating activities, or short-term borrowings. based on our current expectations, we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business. however, we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions. the amount, nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions.

•the revolving credit facility supports our short-term funding needs and also serves to backstop our commercial paper program. we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2021. under the terms of the facility, we have the option to establish incremental commitment increases of up to $500 million if certain conditions are met.
•we expect net interest expense will approximate $380 million for fiscal 2022.
•our ratio of short-term assets to short-term liabilities ("current ratio") was 1.6 to 1 and 1.8 to 1 at october 2, 2021, and october 3, 2020, respectively. the decrease in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to increased accounts payable, current debt and legal contingency accruals, partially offset by increased cash, accounts receivable and inventories.
•at october 2, 2021, $464 million of our cash was held in the international accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. generally, we do not rely on the foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. we intend to repatriate excess cash (net of applicable withholding taxes) not subject to regulatory requirements and to indefinitely reinvest outside of the united states the remainder of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. we do not expect the regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.
capital resources credit facility cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. we also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed capacity of $2.25 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs and to backstop our commercial paper program.
at october 2, 2021, amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility totaled $2.25 billion. our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 20 banks, with commitments ranging from $35 million to $175 million per bank.
commercial paper program our commercial paper program provides a low-cost source of borrowing to fund general corporate purposes including working capital requirements. the maximum borrowing capacity under the commercial paper program is $1 billion. the maturities of the notes may vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. as of october 2, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program. our ability to access commercial paper in the future may be limited or its costs increased.
capitalization to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our long-term financing decisions. at october 2, 2021, and october 3, 2020, the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 1.2x and 2.3x, respectively. refer to other key financial measures below for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") measures.
credit ratings revolving credit facility s&p's applicable rating is "bbb+." moody's applicable rating is "baa2." the below table outlines the fees paid on the unused portion of the facility ("facility fee rate") and letter of credit fees and borrowings ("all-in borrowing spread") that corresponds to the applicable ratings levels from s&p and moody's.

in the event the ratings fall within different levels, the applicable rate will be based upon the higher of the two levels or, if there is more than a one-notch split between the two levels, then the applicable rate will be based upon the level that is one level below the higher level.
debt covenants our revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. in addition, we are required to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio.
our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october 2, 2021 and expect that we will maintain compliance.
pension plans as further described in part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 16: pensions and other postretirement benefits, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets. the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of $215 million at the end of fiscal 2021 as compared to an underfunded position of $234 million at the end of fiscal 2020. we expect to contribute approximately $14 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2022 as compared to approximately $15 million in fiscal 2021. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements. as a result, the actual funding in fiscal 2022 may be different from the estimate.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. the off-balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties, including leases, debt and livestock grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. see part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 21: commitments and contingencies for further discussion.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 2, 2021 (in millions):
payments due by period
2022                                                                 2023-2024                  2025-2026                 2027 and thereafter                    total debt principal payments (1)               $1,069                  $1,719                       $828                           $5,824                        $9,440
interest payments (2)                        409                     712                        580                            3,277                         4,978

operating lease obligations (4)              162                     214                        116                               61                           553
purchase obligations (5)                   2,455                     455                        201                              124                         3,235
capital expenditures (6)                   1,610                     727                          -                                -                         2,337

total contractual commitments             $5,729                  $3,842                     $1,759                           $9,312                       $21,459
(1)in the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur.
(2)interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective interest rates at october 2, 2021, and expected payment dates.
(3)amounts include guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties, which consist of leases, debt and livestock grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. the amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.
(4)for additional information regarding operating leases, refer to part ii, item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 6: leases.
(5)amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains and livestock purchase contracts, that provide terms that meet the above criteria. for certain grain purchase commitments with a fixed quantity provision, we have assumed the future obligations under the commitment based on available commodity futures prices as published in observable active markets as of october 2, 2021. we have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. purchase orders are not included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is cancellable. contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded.
(6)amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of october 2, 2021.
(7)other long-term liabilities primarily consist of deferred compensation, deferred income, self-insurance and asset retirement obligations. amount also consists of $134 million of payroll tax deferrals associated with the cares act, which we expect will be paid in fiscal 2023. we are unable to reliably estimate the amount and timing of the remaining payments beyond fiscal 2021; therefore, we have only included the total liability in the table above. we also have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits of $285 million that are excluded from the table above. a discussion of the company's pension and postretirement plans, including funding matters, is included in part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 16: pensions and other postretirement benefits.
in addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $135 million and related interest and penalties of $49 million at october 2, 2021, recorded in other long-term liabilities.
the potential maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at october 2, 2021, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier's net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $305 million. after analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions, we had no allowance for these programs' estimated uncollectible receivables at october 2, 2021.

(c)for the total debt to capitalization calculation, capitalization is defined as total debt plus total shareholders' equity.
(d)book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity by the sum of class a and b shares outstanding.
ebitda is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. net debt to ebitda represents the ratio of our debt, net of cash and short-term investments, to ebitda. ebitda and net debt to ebitda are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. we believe the presentation of these financial measures helps investors to assess our operating performance from period to period, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt, enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. these measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies; however, the measurements of ebitda and net debt to ebitda may not be comparable to those of other companies, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. ebitda and net debt to ebitda are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. ebitda is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine ebitda involve outlays of cash. as a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from ebitda. investors should rely primarily on our gaap results, and use non-gaap financial measures only supplementally, in making investment decisions.
recently issued/adopted accounting pronouncements refer to the discussion under part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 1: business and summary of significant accounting policies and note 2: changes in accounting principles.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. we have considered the impact of the global covid-19 pandemic on our consolidated financial statements. in addition to the covid-19 impacts we have already experienced, and continue to experience, there are likely to be future impacts, the ultimate extent of which is uncertain and largely subject to whether the severity worsens or duration lengthens. these impacts could include but may not be limited to risks and uncertainty related to worker availability, our ability to operate production facilities, demand-driven production facility closures, shifts in demand between sales channels and market volatility in our supply chain. consequently, this may subject us to future risk of material goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairments, increased reserves for uncollectible accounts, and adjustments for inventory and market volatility for items subject to fair value measurements such as derivatives and investments. the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical. these estimates require levels of subjectivity and judgment, which could result in actual results differing from our estimates.
contingent liabilities description we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, antitrust, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. we disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable.
judgments and uncertainties our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events, and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages, and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years. as set forth in part ii, item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 21: commitments and contingencies, we recognized $626 million of charges in fiscal 2021 from legal accruals related to our broiler antitrust civil litigation, broiler chicken grower litigation, and wage rate litigation based on our assessment of the likelihood and amount of probable losses. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.
revenue recognition description we recognize revenue for the sale of our product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale. revenue is measured by the transaction price, which is defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing goods to customers. the transaction price is adjusted for estimates of known or expected variable consideration, which includes consumer incentives, trade promotions, and allowances, such as coupons, discounts, rebates, volume-based incentives, cooperative advertising, and other programs. variable consideration related to these programs is recorded as a reduction to revenue based on amounts we expect to pay.
judgments and uncertainties the transaction price contains estimates of known or expected variable consideration. we base these estimates on current performance, historical utilization, and projected redemption rates of each program. we review and update these estimates regularly until the incentives or product returns are realized and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue. as noted above, estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. typically, programs that are offered have a short duration, and historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. however, if the level of redemption rates or performance were to vary significantly from estimates, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue during the past three fiscal years.
accrued self-insurance description we are self-insured for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers' compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. we use an independent third-party actuary to assist in determining our self-insurance liability. we and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self-insurance liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. we periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third-party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self-insurance liability. our policy is to maintain an accrual at the actuarial estimated median.
judgments and uncertainties our self-insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used. costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self-insurance liability to change. incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self-insurance liability to change.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self-insurance liability. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. a 10% change in the actuarial estimate at october 2, 2021, would not have a significant impact on our liability.
income taxes description we estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income. income tax includes an estimate for withholding taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted to the united states but does not include an estimate for taxes on earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary. deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. we record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
judgments and uncertainties changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future. our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. other than those potential impacts, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances. however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. to the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
defined benefit pension plans description we sponsor four defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain team members. we also participate in a multi-employer plan that provides defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements. such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives. we use independent third-party actuaries to assist us in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. we and the actuaries review assumptions that include estimates of the present value of the projected future pension payment to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. we accumulate and amortize the effect of actuarial gains and losses over future periods. net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit pension plans was $11 million in fiscal 2021. the projected benefit obligation was $248 million at the end of fiscal 2021. unrecognized actuarial loss was $40 million at the end of fiscal 2021. we currently expect net periodic benefit cost associated with our pension plans to be approximately $10 million in fiscal 2022. we expect to contribute approximately $14 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2022. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements.
judgments and uncertainties our defined benefit pension plans contain uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used. the key assumptions used in developing the required estimates include such factors as discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement rates, and mortality. these assumptions can have a material impact upon the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost. the expected liquidation of certain plans has been considered along with these assumptions. the discount rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. in determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans. we then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based on expected returns. investment, management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. it is reasonably likely that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods.
the risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans. the net pension cost of the multi-employer plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our team members. the future cost of these plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, they are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect the net periodic benefit cost in future periods. a 1% change in the discount rate at october 2, 2021, would not have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation or net periodic benefit cost. a 1% change in the return on plan assets at october 2, 2021, would not have a significant impact on net periodic benefit cost. the sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time with the remaining assumptions held constant. economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effect of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear.
impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets description goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. if it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. additionally, we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
for indefinite life intangible assets, a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired. similar to goodwill, we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test. upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. however, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets outside of the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization.
judgments and uncertainties we estimate the fair value of our reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method) and another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method), which use significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. we include assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. generally, we utilize operating margin assumptions based on future expectations, operating margins historically realized in the reporting units' industries and industry marketplace valuation multiples.
our chicken segment reporting units had goodwill at october 2, 2021 of $3.3 billion. we generally assumed operating margins in future years would normalize over time as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year, we would have failed the quantitative step of the annual impairment test, which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. the current year results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to a decline in hatch rate, a challenging labor environment and market disruptions, which impacts we expect to be mostly temporary in nature. to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2021, projected long-term operating margins, utilizing the discounted cash flow method, had to exceed approximately 3.1% on a weighted average basis, which has been achieved in eight of the previous ten years. an increase in the discount rates of approximately 130 basis points on a weighted average basis would have caused the carrying values of our material chicken reporting units to exceed their discounted cash flows' fair values.
our international reporting units, which are presented in international/other for segment presentation, had goodwill at october 2, 2021 of $0.4 billion, which originated from acquisitions in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. we generally assumed operating margins in future years would increase as we continue to integrate recent acquisitions and implement our international growth strategy, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year, reporting units with goodwill totaling $0.2 billion at october 2, 2021 would have failed the quantitative step of the annual impairment test, which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. we are still integrating the recent acquisitions and executing our international and global business strategy, in addition to managing through the temporary impacts of covid-19. to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2021, projected long-term operating margins, utilizing the discounted cash flow method, had to exceed 2%. an increase in the discount rates of approximately 50 basis points would have caused the carrying values of the international reporting units to exceed their discounted cash flows' fair values.
the fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using multi-period excess earnings and relief-from-royalty valuation approaches, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy, and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years. during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, all of our material reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets passed the impairment analysis.
some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market ebitda comparables and credit ratings. while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles, it is possible a material change could occur. if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in material impairments of our goodwill.
all of our material reporting units' estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20% at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination, other than the chicken segment and international reporting units. consequently, we do not currently consider any of our other material reporting units at significant risk of impairment.
our fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analyses did not result in an impairment charge. all indefinite life intangible assets' estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20% at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination. consequently, we do not currently consider any of our material indefinite life intangible assets at significant risk of impairment.
impairment of long-lived assets and definite life intangibles description long-lived assets and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset, a change in its physical condition, or an unexpected change in financial performance.
when evaluating long-lived assets and definite life intangibles for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated undiscounted future cash flows. an impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. for assets held for sale, we compare the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value. the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.
we recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets and definite life intangibles of $60 million, $48 million and $94 million, in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
judgments and uncertainties our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including useful lives and intended use of assets, observable market valuations, forecasted sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles during the last three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments or useful lives of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material. we periodically conduct projects to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity, manufacturing efficiencies and business technology. if we have a significant change in strategies, outlook, or a manner in which we plan to use these assets, we may be exposed to future impairments.
business combinations description we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
we use various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as net realizable value to value inventory, cost method and market approach to value property, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings to value intangibles and discounted cash flow to value goodwill.
for significant acquisitions we may use independent third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
judgments and uncertainties significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, particularly intangible assets. we make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including sales growth, operating margins, attrition rates, and discount rates based on historical results, business plans, expected synergies, perceived risk and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants.
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions, which could result in subsequent impairments. we had no material business combinations during fiscal 2021.

item 1a. risk factors our future results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results, and from our projections. the following risk factors represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business. these are not the only risks we face. additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect, possibly to a material extent, our business, cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. in addition, refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of part i of this form 10-k.
our business and results of operations have been, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the outbreak of covid-19 and such impact could be materially adverse. the global spread of covid-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. in the united states and globally, governmental authorities instituted certain preventative measures, including border closures, travel restrictions, operational restrictions on certain businesses, shelter-in-place orders, quarantines and recommendations to practice social distancing. these restrictions disrupted and may continue to disrupt economic activity, resulting in reduced commercial and consumer confidence and spending, increased unemployment, closure or restricted operating conditions for businesses, volatility in the global capital markets, instability in the credit and financial markets, labor shortages, regulatory recommendations to provide relief for impacted consumers, disruption in supply chains, and restrictions on many hospitality and travel industry operations.
the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our business, operations, and financial results is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the duration or recurrence, of the pandemic, the related length and severity of its impact on the u.s. and global economy, and the continued governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and economic disruption. impacts related to the covid-19 pandemic are expected to continue to pose risks to our business for the foreseeable future, heightened many of the risks and uncertainties identified below, and could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our business is substantially dependent on our clients continued use of our solutions and services, and our results of operations will decline if our clients are no longer willing or able to use them. our clients are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions. if they cease operations or file for bankruptcy protection, we may not be paid for services we already provided, and our client base will shrink, which will lower our revenue. if under financial pressure, our clients may determine that they are no longer willing to pay for the services and solutions we provide, which would reduce our revenue. our clients may decrease their workforce, which would decrease their demand for our services. because of spending constraints on our clients and competition in the industry, we may face pricing pressure on our services and face challenges in onboarding new clients, which would reduce revenue and ultimately impact our results of operations. if the third-party service providers we rely on are unable to perform their services for us and our clients, our operations could be materially disrupted and we could face significant penalties or liabilities.
our operational risk, including data security risk, has increased during the pandemic as a majority of our employees are working remotely and cybercriminal activity increases in an attempt to profit from the disruption to typical operations.
there has been and may continue to be a significant number of new laws and regulations promulgated by federal, state, local, and foreign governments following the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic. we have expended additional resources and incurred additional costs in addressing regulatory requirements applicable to us and our clients. these regulations may be unclear, difficult to interpret or in conflict with other applicable regulations. the failure to comply with these new laws and regulations could result in financial penalties, legal proceedings, and reputational harm.
our business, services, and financial condition may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies. many of our services, particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services, are designed according to government regulations that often change. changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay. such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue. added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business.
our business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with u.s. and foreign laws and regulations. our services are subject to various laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the aca and anti-money laundering rules. the growth of our international operations via acquisition also subjects us to additional risks, such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations. the enactment of new laws and regulations, modifications of existing laws and regulations, or the adverse application or interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations can adversely affect our business. failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the area of health care reform as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base. failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. in addition, as a u.s. company, we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies worldwide, and the foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"). a violation of a sanction or embargo program, or of the fcpa, or similar laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, could subject us, and individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties which could adversely impact our business and operations.
we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services.  the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advancements, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions, and enhancements and changing industry standards. to maintain our growth strategy, we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients. our future success will depend on our ability to: enhance our current products and introduce new products in order to keep pace with products offered by our competitors; enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems, particularly our systems that meet our clients' requirements; and adapt to technological advancements and changing industry standards. we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology. if our systems become outdated, it may negatively impact our ability to meet performance expectations related to quality, time to market, cost and innovation relative to our competitors. the failure to provide more efficient and user-friendly customer-facing digital experience across internet and mobile platforms as well as in physical locations may adversely impact our business and operating results. there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful. if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner, or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results, there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations. the failure to continually develop enhancements and use of technologies such as robotics and other workflow automation tools, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence/machine learning may impact our ability to increase the efficiency of and reduce costs associated with operational risk management and compliance activities.
we could be subject to reduced revenues, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position as a result of cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities or internet disruptions. we rely upon information technology ("it") networks, cloud-based platforms, and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to support a variety of business processes, some of which are provided by third-party vendors. cyberattacks and security threats are a risk to our business and reputation. a cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption or outage, corruption of data, or theft of personal or other sensitive information, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients, result in liability or regulatory sanction, or cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss in confidence in our ability to serve clients all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. the rapid speed of disruptive innovations involving cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities and internet disruptions enabled by new and emerging technologies may outpace our organization's ability to compete and/or manage the risk appropriately. in addition, cybercriminals may seek to exploit the disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic by attempting to engage in payment-related fraud or by more frequently attempting to gain access to our systems through phishing or other means that may be more successful when most of our employees are working remotely.
data security and privacy leaks: we collect, use, and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients, employees of our clients, and our employees, including: bank account numbers, credit card numbers, social security numbers, tax return information, health care information, retirement account information, payroll information, system and network passwords, and other sensitive personal and business information. at the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile cyber-attacks and data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. we may be particularly targeted for cyber-attack because of the amount and type of personal and business information that we collect, use, and retain. vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.
our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premise or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment that we host. the security of our it infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers' purchasing decisions. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures. as cyber threats continue to evolve, we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information. we may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. while we have security systems and it infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information, if our security measures are breached, our business could be substantially harmed, and we could incur significant liabilities. any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us, result in reputational damage, and subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. third-parties, including vendors that provide services for our operations, could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.
data loss and business interruption: if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, including internet or systems failure, or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons, both the company and our clients could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. hardware, applications and services, including cloud-based services, that we develop or procure from third-party vendors may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services. any delays or failures caused by network outages, software or hardware failures, or other data processing disruptions, could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all. we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future. such events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation, regulatory investigation and penalties, loss of clients' business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
our reputation, results of operations, or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy laws and regulations. our services require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees, including personal or identifying information, as well as their financial and payroll data. our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal, state, and local levels, including those governing personal privacy. in the u.s., we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission, the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, the family medical leave act of 1993, the aca, federal and state labor and employment laws, and state data breach notification and data privacy laws, such as the california consumer protection act, which became effective on january 1, 2020. in addition, the european union's general data privacy regulation became fully effective in may 2018. failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.
in the event of a catastrophe, our business continuity plan may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations.    our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster, severe weather including events resulting from climate change, unauthorized security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, public health emergency, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events. our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather, including hurricanes, floods, and snowstorms, and has been successful. however, these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future. if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients.
we may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party service providers to perform their functions.    as part of providing services to clients, we rely on a number of third-party service providers. these service providers include, but are not limited to, couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees. failure by these service providers, for any reason, to deliver their services in a timely manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in material interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us.
we may be exposed to additional risks related to our co-employment relationship within our peo business.    many federal and state laws that apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the "co-employment" relationship within our peo business. state and federal positions regarding co-employment relationships are in a constant state of flux and changed with varying degrees of impact on our operations. we cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations. there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations. although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees' conduct, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. in addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the "employer" under any applicable state or federal laws. incurring additional liabilities related to our peo business may adversely affect our results of operations.
we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers' compensation rates and underlying claims trends.    within our peo business, we maintain health and workers' compensation insurance covering worksite employees. the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo costs. if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity, our costs could increase. in addition, in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts, we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms. also, as a co-employer in the peo, we assume or share many of the employer-related responsibilities associated with health care reform, which may result in increased costs. increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients.
our clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we made on their behalf, resulting in financial loss to us. as part of our payroll processing service, we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities. it is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them. we have in the past, and may in the future, make payments on our clients' behalf for which we may not be reimbursed, resulting in loss to us. if a significant number of our clients are unable to cover payments we make on their behalf, our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted.
our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance.    we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income.
we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment.    trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability. these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business. current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services. in addition, new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit.
we invest our funds held for clients in high quality, investment-grade marketable securities, money markets, and other cash equivalents. however, these funds held for clients are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. these risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility. the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates. in addition, during periods of volatility in the credit markets, certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in, further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds. if we sell available-for-sale securities to satisfy short-term funding requirements, we may recognize losses, which would reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients.
constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings. historically, we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet short-term liquidity needs. however, should we require additional short-term liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds, a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us. growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited. in addition, our ability to grow through significant acquisitions may be limited. see also "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk." if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we made and may continue to make acquisitions that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. acquisitions subject us to risks, including increased debt, assumption of unforeseen liabilities, and difficulties in integrating operations. successful integration involves many challenges, including the difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services, our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, and the loss of key employees of an acquired business. the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions, if any, could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved, a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process, and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process. in addition, an acquisition could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute stockholder interests, for many reasons, including charges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets including goodwill, interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition, and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current stockholders. if the integration of any or all of our acquisitions or future acquisitions is not successful, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.
certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that may constrain the operation of our business, and our failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. the note purchase and guarantee agreement (the "agreement") that we entered into in january 2019 in connection with our acquisition of oasis, contains covenants which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business. these covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, substantial changes in the general nature of our business and our subsidiaries (taken as a whole), certain merger transactions, certain sales of assets and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. the agreement also contains financial covenants, which are reviewed for compliance on a quarterly basis, that require us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00. in addition, certain of our indebtedness may not exceed 20% of our consolidated stockholders' equity. if we do not comply with these covenants, it could result in material adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition.
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified people, which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction. our success, growth, and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified people at all levels, including management, technical, compliance, and sales personnel. competition for these individuals can be intense, and we may not be able to retain our key people, or attract, assimilate, or retain other highly-qualified individuals in the future, which could harm our future success.
failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases. our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees or third-parties. to the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others' advantage. competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products. any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete. third-parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. to the extent we seek to enforce or must defend our intellectual property rights with litigation, we could incur significant expenses and/or be required to pay substantial damages. we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or vendors in connection with claims or litigation. the litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming.
in the event we receive negative publicity, our reputation and the value of our brand could be harmed, and clients may not use our products and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. negative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us, our corporate employees, or others associated with us, whether or not justified, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. if we are unable to maintain quality hcm and employee benefit-related solutions and peo and insurance solutions, our reputation with our clients may be harmed and the value of our brand may diminish. in addition, if our brand is negatively impacted, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, including challenges retaining clients or attracting new clients and recruiting talent and retaining employees.
we are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and, as such, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees, or other costs. we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees, or other third-parties for various actions. from time to time, we are involved in litigation involving claims related to, among other things, breach of contract, tortious conduct, and employment and labor law matters. the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial. although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: refer to the "market risk factors" section contained in item 7a of this form 10-k for a discussion on this type of risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reviews the operating results of paychex, inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries ("paychex," the "company," "we," "our," or "us") for each of the three fiscal years ended may 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020" or the "fiscal year"), may 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019"), and may 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018"), and our financial condition as of may 31, 2020. this review should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k ("form 10-k") and the "risk factors" discussed in item 1a of this form 10-k. forward-looking statements in this review are qualified by the cautionary statement under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements pursuant to the united states private securities litigation reform act of 1995" contained at the beginning of part i of this form 10-k.
overview we are a leading provider of integrated human capital management ("hcm") solutions for human resources ("hr"), payroll, benefits, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses. within our hcm solutions, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse hr and payroll needs.

covid-19 response in march 2020, the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid-19 as a pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic began affecting our operations and employees, our customers' businesses, and the markets we serve in the three months ended may 31, 2020 (the "fourth quarter"). the health and safety of our employees remains our top priority. we were expedient with the implementation of our business continuity plan, which included moving 95% of our workforce to work remotely and restricting unnecessary travel. results of operations for the fourth quarter were adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic as businesses suspended operations. management solutions revenue was impacted by a decline in check volumes, partially offset by increased penetration of retirement services and time and attendance services. the decline in check volumes was due to a reduction in the number of clients processing payrolls as well as the number of employees paid due to state and regional shutdowns. peo and insurance solutions revenue was impacted by a decline in the number of worksite employees serviced by our existing clients. insurance solutions revenue was impacted by a decrease in the number of health and benefit applicants and a decline in workers' compensation premiums. since the end of april, we have seen sequential improvement in our key business metrics across our lines of business.
as our clients continue to manage through the covid-19 pandemic, our priority remains helping them keep their businesses open and return to more normal operations. our blend of technology and service provides valuable tools and resources to assist our clients and their employees during this critical time. the technology investments we made to our paychex flex payroll and human resources suite of products positioned us to service our clients and support them in managing a remote workforce.
we created a covid-19 help center on our website to assist our clients and provide them with the support and resources they need, including:
webinars and white papers with information on the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act, including the historic ppp, and families first coronavirus response act;
guidance on the small business administration ("sba") loan and debt relief process,
interactive ppp loan estimation tool for businesses who are considering or have received funding through the sba program; and
state-by-state resources to help our clients understand specific directives that may impact their business.
the covid-19 help center also provides resources to our key business partners, including accountants, financial institutions, financial advisors, and national associations. the covid-19 help center has been translated into spanish to serve our spanish-speaking clients.
our strong balance sheet and operational flexibility allowed us to successfully manage through the initial impact of covid-19 while protecting our cash flow and liquidity. we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of future changes to market and economic conditions related to covid-19 and will assess the potential impact to our business and financial position. we expect to take a cautious approach to modifying our office and travel restrictions and will wait until we have a clearer vision on how the pandemic unfolds and utilizing guidance provided by the federal, state, and local governments.

management solutions revenue:  management solutions revenue was $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020 and $2.9 billion for fiscal 2019, reflecting growth of 3% and 4%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year periods. both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 benefited from increases in our client base and growth in revenue per client, which improved as a result of higher price realization and increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly hr outsourcing, retirement services, and time and attendance. retirement services revenue growth for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 benefited from an increase in the number of retirement services plans, along with an increase in revenue earned on the asset value of participants' 401(k) funds.
peo and insurance solutions revenue:  peo and insurance solutions revenue was $990.6 million for fiscal 2020 and $814.2 million for fiscal 2019, reflecting growth of 22% and 46%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year periods. in addition to the acquisition of oasis, peo and insurance solutions revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was driven by growth in clients across our peo business. in addition, for fiscal 2019, peo and insurance solutions revenue growth was driven by growth in client worksite employees across our peo business.
insurance solutions revenue for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit clients, offset by declining rates in the workers' compensation market. in addition, for fiscal 2019, insurance solutions revenue was impacted by an increase in the number of health and benefit applicants.
interest on funds held for clients:  interest on funds held for clients increased 8% for fiscal 2020 and 27% for fiscal 2019 to $86.9 million and $80.6 million, respectively. for fiscal 2020 the increase was due to higher realized gains, offset by lower average investment balances and average interest rates. the realized gains primarily resulted from the strategic repositioning of our client fund portfolio to enhance liquidity in response to the uncertainty caused by covid-19. for fiscal 2019, the increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates earned.
average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1% and 2% for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. for fiscal 2020, funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by lower client fund collections due to covid-19 and changes in client base mix, offset by wage inflation and timing of collections and remittances. for fiscal 2019, the decrease in average investment balances for funds held for clients was primarily driven by the impact of lower client withholdings as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tax act"), and changes in client base mix, partially offset by the impact of wage inflation.

(1)percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
compensation-related expenses increased 6% for fiscal 2020 and 13% for fiscal 2019. for fiscal 2020, the increases in compensation-related expenses were driven by the acquisition of oasis, increased headcount, and higher wages, offset by a decrease in performance-based pay. for fiscal 2019, the increases in compensation-related expenses were driven by the acquisition of oasis, increased headcount, higher wages, and an increase in performance-based pay. as of may 31, 2020, we had approximately 15,800 employees compared with 15,600 employees as of may 31, 2019.
depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and both purchased and internally developed software. amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions. the growth in depreciation and amortization for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, were primarily driven by the amortization of acquired oasis intangible assets.
peo insurance costs include workers' compensation, minimum premium medical insurance plan arrangements, and self-insured dental and vision plans where we retain risk. the acquisition of oasis, along with the growth in our peo business, contributed to the increase in peo insurance costs for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. in addition, the acquisition of hr outsourcing holdings, inc. ("hroi") contributed to the increase in peo insurance costs for fiscal 2019.
other expenses include items such as non-capital equipment, delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business. other expense growth for fiscal 2020 was impacted by the acquisition of oasis and by continued investment in product development and supporting technology, tempered by the impact of covid-19 in the fourth quarter which drove decreases in other selling, general and administrative expenses, including travel and entertainment. the increase in other expenses for fiscal 2019 was impacted by the acquisitions of oasis and hroi and continued investment in product development and supporting technology. other expenses for fiscal 2018 included a one-time expense of $32.6 million related to the termination of certain license agreements.
operating income:  operating income increased 7% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020 and 6% to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2019. operating margin (operating income, as a percentage of total revenue), was 36.1%, 36.3%, and 38.2% for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. adjusted operating income(1) increased 7% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020 and 4% to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2019. earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda")(1) increased 8% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2020 and 9% to $1.6 billion for fiscal 2019. ebitda margin(1) was 41.4%, 41.2%, and 42.3% for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

other (expense)/income, net:  other (expense)/income, net, primarily represents interest expense incurred on our debt instruments, netted against earnings from our corporate cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. we recognized $23.4 million and $3.3 million of other expense, net in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, which was driven by interest expense related to our long-term borrowings. other expense, net included $33.3 million and $13.7 million of interest expense related to our long-term borrowings in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.
income taxes:  our effective income tax rate was 23.6% for fiscal 2020, 24.4% for fiscal 2019, and 23.5% for fiscal 2018. the effective income tax rates in all periods were impacted by recognition of net discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments. in fiscal 2019, the effective income tax rate included discrete tax expense for changes in tax reserves and the revaluation of deferred tax balances for legislative updates. in fiscal 2018, as a result of the tax act, we recorded a non-recurring net tax benefit for the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities. this amount impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.23 per diluted share for fiscal 2018. additional discrete tax items recognized during each respective period are insignificant. refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional disclosures on income taxes.
net income and diluted earnings per share:  net income increased 6% to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020 and 4% to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019. diluted earnings per share increased 6% to $3.04 per diluted share for fiscal 2020 and 4% to $2.86 per diluted share for fiscal 2019. adjusted net income increased 5% to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020 and increased 11% to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019. adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.00 per diluted share for fiscal 2020 and $2.84 per diluted share for fiscal 2019, reflecting increases of 6% and 11%, respectively. refer to the "non-gaap financial measures" section that follows for a discussion of these non-gaap measures.

(1)additional expense and corresponding tax benefit recognized as a result of the termination of certain license agreements. this event is not expected to recur.
(2)net tax windfall benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments recognized in income taxes. this item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price, neither of which is within the control of management.
(3)for fiscal 2019, this line item represents a one-time tax charge that was recognized during the three months ended august 31, 2018 as a result of updated guidance on internal revenue code section 162(m). this event is not expected to recur. for fiscal 2018, this line item represents non-recurring tax benefits recognized as a result of the tax act related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities.
in addition to reporting operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, which are u.s. gaap measures, we present adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, ebitda, and ebitda margin (ebitda as a percentage of total revenue), which are non-gaap measures. we believe these additional measures are indicators of our core business operations' performance period over period. adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, ebitda and ebitda margin are not calculated through the application of u.s. gaap and are not required forms of disclosure by the sec. as such, they should not be considered as a substitute for the u.s. gaap measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the u.s. gaap measures. the use of any non-gaap measure may produce results that vary from the u.s. gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-gaap measure used by other companies.
liquidity and capital resources our financial position as of may 31, 2020 remained strong with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.0 billion. total short-term and long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs were $801.9 million as of may 31, 2020. our primary source of cash is generated by our ongoing operations. cash flows from operations were $1.4 billion for fiscal 2020. our positive cash flows for fiscal 2020 allowed us to support our business and pay substantial dividends. we currently anticipate that cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments as of may 31, 2020, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our business operations, capital purchases, share repurchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
we believe that our investments in an unrealized loss position as of may 31, 2020 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any other-than-temporary impairment.
financing short-term financing: we maintain committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of our normal and recurring business operations. the purpose of these credit facilities is to meet short-term funding requirements, finance working capital needs, and for general corporate purposes. we typically borrow on an overnight or short-term basis on our credit facilities. refer to note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion on our credit facilities.

short-term borrowings are primarily used for the settlement of client fund obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have been invested in available-for-sale securities allocated to our long-term portfolio.
subsequent to may 31, 2020, we borrowed twice on an overnight basis, $89.5 million on a weighted-average basis under our pnc credit facility.
we expect to have access to the amounts available under our current credit facilities as needed to meet our ongoing financial needs. however, if we experience reductions in our operating cash flows due to any of the risk factors outlined in, but not limited to, item 1a in this form 10-k and other sec filings, including any impacts related to covid-19, we may need to adjust our capital, operating and other discretionary spending to realign our working capital requirements with the capital resources available to us. additionally, if we determined the need for additional short-term liquidity, there is no assurance that such financing, if pursued and obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.
letters of credit:  as of may 31, 2020, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling $147.9 million, required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. the letters of credit expire at various dates between june 2020 and january 2022. no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2020 or as of may 31, 2020. subsequent to may 31, 2020, letters of credit expiring in june and july 2020 were renewed through june and july 2021, respectively.
long-term financing: on march 13, 2019, we borrowed $800.0 million through the issuance of long-term private placement debt. certain information related to the senior notes are as follows:

(1)operating leases are primarily for office space and equipment used in our service, fulfillment, and sales operations.
(2)purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and services and legally binding contractual arrangements with future payment obligations. included in the total purchase obligations is $5.0 million of commitments to purchase capital assets. amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be different due to variable components of these agreements.
(3)includes principal and interest payments on our senior notes. refer to note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10-k for more information.
the liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was approximately $26.5 million as of may 31, 2020. refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10-k for more information on income taxes. we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above.
we are involved in two limited partnership agreements to contribute a maximum amount of $20.0 million to venture capital funds in the financial technology sector. as of may 31, 2020, we have contributed approximately $8.4 million of the total funding commitment. the timing of future contributions to be made to these venture capital funds cannot be specifically or reasonably determined and thus have been excluded from the table above.
in the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees. we have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us.
we currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and peo employee benefit plans. our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and are not material as of may 31, 2020. we also maintain corporate insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company.
off-balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. we do maintain investments as a limited partner in both low-income housing projects and venture capital funds focused on the financial technology sector. these are not considered part of our ongoing operations. these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of may 31, 2020.

operating cash flow activities the changes in our operating cash flows for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 compared to the prior fiscal year periods were due to higher net income, higher non-cash adjustments, and fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities.
the increase in non-cash adjustments for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were primarily driven by larger adjustments for the amortization of intangible assets.
in fiscal 2020, the smaller outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to the prior fiscal year period was due to changes in accounts receivable and peo unbilled receivables, which were adversely impacted by covid-19. we experienced an increase in the number of non-processing clients and a reduction in the number of employees and worksite employees paid as businesses suspended operations due to the pandemic. in addition, accounts payable and other current liabilities were impacted by a decrease in accrued compensation related to worksite employees and timing of accruals and cash settlement. in fiscal 2019, the larger outflow was due to higher accounts receivable balances related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing agency clients.
investing cash flow activities the changes in our investing cash flows for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 compared to prior year periods were primarily attributable to fluctuations in the net purchases and sales/maturities of available-for-sale securities, changes in net cash outflows related to acquisitions of businesses, and purchases of other assets.
fluctuations in the net change in purchases and sales/maturities of available-for-sale securities are largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio. the amount will vary based upon the timing of collection from clients, and the related remittance to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. specific timing impacting cash flows for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 are discussed further in the financing cash flows discussion of net changes in client fund obligations. in addition to timing fluctuations, the net change in purchases and sales/maturities of available-for-sale securities for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 compared to prior year periods were due to changes in investment mix.
the changes in net cash outflows related to acquisition of businesses reflect our acquisitions of oasis in december 2018, lessor group ("lessor") in february 2018, and hroi in august 2017. we paid cash for the oasis and lessor acquisitions, while we paid a combination of cash and common stock for the hroi acquisition.
the net cash outflow for purchases of other assets during fiscal 2018 was impacted by the resolution of a contractual dispute with certain licensees and the acquisition of rights to certain client lists for approximately $30.0 million.
discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the "market risk factors" section contained in item 7a of this form 10-k.
financing cash flow activities the changes in our financing cash flows for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 compared to prior fiscal year periods were impacted by net proceeds from long-term borrowings, the net change in client fund obligations, repurchases of common shares, and dividends paid.
in fiscal 2019, we borrowed $800.0 million under our jpm credit facilities to fund the acquisition of oasis which was replaced by the issuance of long-term private placement debt in march 2019. refer to note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional disclosures on our long-term financing.
the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. may 31, 2020 fell on a sunday and may 31, 2019 fell on a friday, which is a significant disbursement day for direct pay funds, and as such only created minor timing differences in this liability when comparing fiscal 2020 with fiscal 2019. however, may 31, 2020 balances were impacted by lower client fund collections due to covid-19. in contrast, may 31, 2018 fell on a thursday, which is a significant collection day for direct pay funds. these funds were then paid out on friday june 1, 2018.
the increase in dividend payments for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding prior year periods is primarily due to an 11% and 12% increase in our dividend rate beginning in may 2019 and april 2018, respectively. the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board.
during fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2018, we repurchased 2.0 million shares, 0.7 million shares, and 2.5 million shares, respectively. as of may 31, 2020, $228.1 million remains available under the common stock repurchase program. refer to note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion on our common stock repurchase program.
other recently issued accounting pronouncements:  refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10-k for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting policies note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10-k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex. our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. we base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
revenue recognition:  service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. fees earned for funding of temporary staffing clients' payrolls via purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract. the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are included in cost of service revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
we receive advance payments for set-up fees on some of our service offerings from our clients. advance payments received for certain of our service offerings are considered a material right. we defer the revenue associated with these advance payments, recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the right exists.
peo solutions revenue is reported net of certain direct pass-through costs billed and incurred, which include payroll wages, payroll taxes, including federal and state unemployment insurance, and certain health insurance benefit premiums, primarily costs related to our guaranteed cost benefit plans. direct costs related to workers' compensation and certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as cost of service revenue rather than as a reduction in service revenue.
interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services.
assets recognized from the costs to obtain and fulfill contracts: we recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new contracts and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. we do not incur incremental costs to obtain a contract renewal. the company determined that certain sales commissions and bonuses, including related fringe benefits, meet the capitalization criteria under accounting standards codification ("asc") subtopic 340-40, "other assets and deferred costs: contracts with customers" ("asc 340-40"). we also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. we determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and meet the capitalization criteria under asc 340-40. these capitalized costs to fulfill a contract principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered and enhance our ability to satisfy future performance obligations.
the assets related to both costs to obtain and costs to fulfill contracts with clients are capitalized and amortized using an accelerated method over an eight-year life to closely align with the pattern of client attrition over the estimated life of the client relationship. we regularly review our deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during the fiscal years ended may 31, 2020 or may 31, 2019.
peo insurance reserves:  as part of the peo solution, we offer workers' compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees. workers' compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers' compensation insurance policies. workers' compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. these reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. in establishing the peo workers' compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims. the evaluation, review and determination of estimated ultimate losses by our appointed actuary are based on actuarial methods and assumptions. the estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon estimated loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees' job responsibilities, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. each reporting period, changes in actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers' compensation claims cost estimates.
with respect to our peo health insurance, we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier. in addition, we also provide self-insured dental and vision plans to certain peo clients. under the minimum medical premium insurance arrangement and self-insured dental and vision plans, our health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with our service contract with the carrier. the claims liability includes estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims.
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and independent actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly with workers' compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future. we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves. adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends. adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for the fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018.
goodwill and other intangible assets:  goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.  we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter. a qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value. the qualitative assessment considered various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors. based on the results of our testing, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2020, 2019, or 2018. subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the company's goodwill balance.
we also test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for potential impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances change in a way that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. we have determined that there is no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal 2020, 2019, or 2018.
impairment of long-lived assets: long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. we have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for fiscal 2020, 2019, or 2018.
stock-based compensation costs:  all stock-based awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a black-scholes option pricing model. this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life. volatility is estimated based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility. expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior. we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model. we will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.
the fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant. for grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents, the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period.
we estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified, with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.
the assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. any material change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award.
refer to note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.
income taxes:  we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. we record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. at the time of the exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards, we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions. we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements. prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements, we must conclude that tax positions will be more-likely-than-not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities. if a tax position drops below the more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. a change in the assessment of the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions.

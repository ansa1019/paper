risk factors summary an investment in our securities involves various risks. such risks, including those set forth in the summary of material risks in this item 1a, should be carefully considered before purchasing our securities.
risks related to operating factors
•we may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions, investments, or development or redevelopment projects or to successfully and profitably operate properties.
•we could default on our ground leases or be unable to renew or re-lease our land or space on favorable terms or at all. our tenants may also be unable to pay us rent.
•the cost of maintaining and improving the quality of our properties may be higher than anticipated, and we may be unable to pass any increased operating costs through to our tenants, which can result in reduced cash flows and profitability.
•we could be held liable for environmental damages resulting from our tenants' use of hazardous materials, or from harmful mold, poor air quality, or other defects from our properties, or we could face increased costs in complying with other environmental laws.
•the loss of services of any of our senior officers or key employees and increased competition for skilled personnel could adversely affect us and/or increase our labor costs.
•we rely on a limited number of vendors to provide utilities and other services at our properties, and disruption in such services may have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.
•our insurance may not adequately cover all of our potential losses, or we may incur costs due to the financial condition of our insurance carriers.
•we may change business policies without stockholder approval.
•failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business.
•if we failed to qualify as a reit, we would be taxed at corporate rates and would not be able to take certain deductions when computing our taxable income.
•we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations due to adverse changes in our credit ratings, our inability to refinance our existing debt or issue new debt, or our inability to sell existing properties quickly.
•we may invest or spend the net proceeds from our equity or debt offerings in ways with which our investors may not agree and in ways that may not earn a profit.
•our debt service obligations may restrict our ability to engage in some business activities or cause other adverse effects on our business.
•we face risks and liabilities associated with our investments (including those in connection with short-term liquid investments) and the companies in which we invest (including properties owned through partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures, as well as through our non-real estate venture investment portfolio), which expose us to risks similar to those of our tenant base and additional risks inherent in venture capital investing. we may be limited in our ability to diversify our investments.
risks related to market and industry factors
•there are limits on ownership of our stock under which a stockholder may lose beneficial ownership of its shares, as well as certain provisions of our charter and bylaws that may delay or prevent transactions that otherwise may be desirable to our stockholders.
•possible future sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect its market price.
•we are dependent on the health of the life science, technology, and agtech industries, and changes within these industries, increased competition, or the inability of our tenants and non-real estate equity investments within these industries to obtain funding for research, development, and other operations may adversely impact their ability to make rental payments to us or adversely impact their value.
•market disruption and volatility, poor economic conditions in the capital markets and global economy, including in connection with the covid-19 pandemic, and high unemployment levels could adversely affect the value of the companies in which we hold equity investments or the ability of tenants and the companies in which we invest to raise additional capital or access capital from venture capital investors or financial institutions on favorable terms.
risks related to government and global factors
•actions, policy, or key leadership changes in government agencies, or changes to laws or regulations, including those related to tax, accounting, debt, derivatives, government spending, or funding (including those related to the fda, the national institutes of health (the "nih"), the sec, and other agencies), and drug and healthcare pricing, costs, and programs could have a significant negative impact on the overall economy, our tenants, and our business.
•partial or complete government shutdown resulting in temporary closures of agencies could adversely affect our tenants (some of which are also government agencies) and the companies in which we invest, including delays in the commercialization of such companies' products, decreased funding of research and development, or delays surrounding approval of budget proposals.
•the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.
•the current outbreak of covid-19, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could adversely impact or cause disruption to our financial condition and results of operations, and/or to the financial condition and results of operations of our tenants and non-real estate investments.
risks related to general and other factors
•social, political, and economic instability, unrest, significant changes, and other circumstances beyond our control, including circumstances related to changes in the u.s. presidential administration, could adversely affect our business operations.
•seasonal weather conditions, climate change and severe weather, changes in the availability of transportation or labor, especially in connection with the covid-19 pandemic, and other related factors may affect our ability to conduct business, the products, and services of our tenants, or the availability of such products and services of our tenants and the companies in which we invest.
•we may be unable to meet our sustainability goals.
•system failures or security incidents through cyber attacks, intrusions, or other methods could disrupt our information technology networks and related systems, cause a loss of assets or data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could result in substantial reputational damage and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
•we are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies and downgrades of domestic and foreign government sovereign credit ratings.
we attempt to mitigate the foregoing risks. however, if we are unable to effectively manage the impact of these and other risks, our ability to meet our investment objectives would be substantially impaired and any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or the market price of our common stock.
operating factors we may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions and successfully operate acquired properties.
we continually evaluate the market of available properties and may acquire properties when opportunities exist. our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully operate them may be exposed to significant risks, including, but not limited to the following:
•we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including both publicly traded reits and institutional funds;
•even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price or result in other less favorable terms;
•even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties, these agreements are subject to customary conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction;
•we may be unable to complete an acquisition because we cannot obtain debt and/or equity financing on favorable terms or at all;
•we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;
•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of operating properties or portfolios of properties, into our existing operations;
•acquired properties may be subject to reassessment, which may result in higher-than-expected property tax payments;
•market conditions may result in higher-than-expected vacancy rates and lower-than-expected rental rates; and
•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities, such as liabilities for the remediation of undisclosed environmental contamination; claims by tenants, vendors, or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties; and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers, and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.
the realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.
we may suffer economic harm as a result of making unsuccessful acquisitions in new markets.
we may pursue selective acquisitions of properties in markets where we have not previously owned properties. these acquisitions may entail risks in addition to those we face in other acquisitions where we are familiar with the markets, such as the risk of not correctly anticipating conditions or trends in a new market and therefore not being able to generate profit from the acquired property. if this occurs, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, and the market price of our common stock.
the acquisition of new properties or the development of new properties may give rise to difficulties in predicting revenue potential.
we may continue to acquire additional properties and/or land and may seek to develop our existing land holdings strategically as warranted by market conditions. these acquisitions and developments could fail to perform in accordance with expectations. if we fail to accurately estimate occupancy levels, rental rates, lease commencement dates, operating costs, or costs of improvements to bring an acquired property or a development property up to the standards established for our intended market position, the performance of the property may be below expectations. acquired properties may have characteristics or deficiencies affecting their valuation or revenue potential that we have not yet discovered. we cannot assure our stockholders that the performance of properties acquired or developed by us will increase or be maintained under our management.
we may fail to achieve the financial results expected from development or redevelopment projects.
there are significant risks associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, but not limited to, the following possibilities:
•we may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;
•we may be unable to lease development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;
•we may encounter project delays or cancellations due to unavailability of necessary labor and construction materials;
•we may expend funds on, and devote management's time to, development and redevelopment projects that we may not complete;
•we may abandon development or redevelopment projects after we begin to explore them, and as a result, we may lose deposits or fail to recover costs already incurred;
•market and economic conditions may deteriorate, which can result in lower-than-expected rental rates;
•we may face higher operating costs than we anticipated for development or redevelopment projects, including insurance premiums, utilities, real estate taxes, and costs of complying with changes in government regulations or increases in tariffs;
•we may face higher requirements for capital improvements than we anticipated for development or redevelopment projects, particularly in older structures;
•we may be unable to proceed with development or redevelopment projects because we cannot obtain debt and/or equity financing on favorable terms or at all;
•we may fail to retain tenants that have pre-leased our development or redevelopment projects if we do not complete the construction of these properties in a timely manner or to the tenants' specifications;
•tenants that have pre-leased our development or redevelopment projects may file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, which may adversely affect the income produced by, and the value of, our properties or require us to change the scope of the project, which may potentially result in higher construction costs and lower financial returns;
•we may encounter delays, refusals, unforeseen cost increases, and other impairments resulting from third-party litigation, natural disasters, or severe weather conditions;
•we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, and other required government permits and authorizations; and
•development or redevelopment projects may have defects we do not discover through our inspection processes, including latent defects that may not reveal themselves until many years after we put a property in service.
the realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.
we could default on leases for land on which some of our properties are located or held for future development.
if we default under the terms of a ground lease obligation, we may lose the ownership rights to the property subject to the lease. upon expiration of a ground lease and all of its options, we may not be able to renegotiate a new lease on favorable terms, if at all. the loss of the ownership rights to these properties or an increase in rental expense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our stockholders, as well as the market price of our common stock. refer to "ground lease obligations" in the "uses of capital" subsection of the "capital resources" section under "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our ground lease obligations.
we may not be able to operate properties successfully and profitably.
our success depends in large part upon our ability to operate our properties successfully. if we are unable to do so, our business could be adversely affected. the ownership and operation of real estate is subject to many risks that may adversely affect our business and our ability to make payments to our stockholders, including, but not limited to, the following risks:
•our properties may not perform as we expect;
•we may have to lease space at rates below our expectations;
•we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms; and
•we may underestimate the cost of improvements required to maintain or improve space to meet standards established for the market position intended for that property.
the realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.
we may not be able to attain the expected return on our investments in real estate joint ventures.
as of december 31, 2020, we had several consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we shared ownership and decision-making power with one or more parties. our joint venture partners must agree in order for the applicable joint venture to take specific major actions, including budget approvals, acquisitions, sales of assets, debt financing, execution of lease agreements, and vendor approvals. under these joint venture arrangements, any disagreements between us and our partners may result in delayed decisions. our inability to take unilateral actions that we believe are in our best interests may result in missed opportunities and an ineffective allocation of resources and could have an adverse effect on the financial performance of the joint venture and our operating results.
we may experience increased operating costs, which may reduce profitability to the extent that we are unable to pass those costs through to our tenants.
our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses, including insurance, property taxes, utilities, administrative costs, and other costs associated with security, landscaping, and repairs and maintenance of our properties. as of december 31, 2020, approximately 94% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate and other rent-related taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.
our operating expenses may increase as a result of tax reassessments that our properties are subject to on a regular basis (annually, triennially, etc.), which normally result in increases in property taxes over time as property values increase. in california, however, pursuant to the existing state law commonly referred to as proposition 13, properties are generally reassessed to market value at the time of change in ownership or completion of construction; thereafter, annual property reassessments are limited to 2% of previously assessed values. as a result, proposition 13 generally results in significant below-market assessed values over time. from time to time, lawmakers and political coalitions initiate efforts to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial properties, including by introducing proposition 15 on the ballot in california, which failed to pass adoption on november 3, 2020.
our triple net leases allow us to pass through, among other costs, substantially all real estate and rent-related taxes to our tenants in the form of tenant recoveries. consequently, as a result of our triple net leases, we do not expect potential increases on property taxes as a result of tax reassessments to significantly impact our operating results. we cannot be certain, however, that we will be able to continue to negotiate pass-through provisions related to taxes in tenant leases in the future, or that higher pass-through expenses will not lead to lower base rents in the long run as a result of tenants' not being able to absorb higher overall occupancy costs. thus, the repeal of or amendment to proposition 13 could lead to a decrease in our income from rentals over time. if our operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish. in addition, we cannot be certain that increased costs will not lead our current or prospective tenants to seek space outside of the state of california, which could significantly hinder our ability to increase our rents or to maintain existing occupancy levels. the repeal of or amendment to proposition 13 in california may significantly increase occupancy costs for some of our tenants and may adversely impact their financial condition, ability to make rental payments, and ability to renew lease agreements, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
in addition, we expect to incur higher costs as a result of doing business in california and other states. for example, compliance with various laws passed in california and civil unrest in washington may result in cost increases due to new constraints on our business and the effects of potential non-compliance by us or third-party service providers. any changes in connection with compliance could be time consuming and expensive, while failure to timely implement required changes could subject us to liability for non-compliance, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
the cost of maintaining the quality of our properties may be higher than anticipated, which can result in reduced cash flows and profitability.
if our properties are not as attractive to current and prospective tenants in terms of rent, services, condition, or location as properties owned by our competitors, we could lose tenants or suffer lower rental rates. as a result, we may, from time to time, be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain the competitiveness of our properties. however, there can be no assurances that any such expenditures would result in higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter existing tenants from relocating to properties owned by our competitors.
our inability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire may significantly affect our business.
our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. if our tenants experience a downturn in their business or other types of financial distress, they may be unable to make timely payments under their leases. in addition, because of the impact to business environment due to the civil unrest, high cost of living, taxes, and other increased region specific costs of doing business in certain of our markets and submarkets, such as those located in the states of california and washington, tenants may choose not to renew or re-lease space. also, if our tenants terminate early or decide not to renew their leases, we may not be able to re-lease the space. even if tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, concessions, and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. consequently, we could generate less cash flows from the affected properties than expected, which could negatively impact our business. we may have to divert cash flows generated by other properties to meet our debt service payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected properties.
the inability of a tenant to pay us rent could adversely affect our business.
our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. if our tenants, especially significant tenants, fail to make rental payments under their leases, our financial condition, cash flows, and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. additionally, the inability of the u.s. congress to enact a budget for a fiscal year or the occurrence of partial or complete u.s. government shutdowns may result in financial difficulties for tenants that are dependent on federal funding, which could adversely affect the ability of those tenants to pay us rent.
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a property. if any of our tenants becomes a debtor in a case under the u.s. bankruptcy code, as amended, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. the bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. our claim against such a tenant for uncollectible future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant's lease. any shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
we could be held liable for damages resulting from our tenants' use of hazardous materials.
many of our tenants engage in research and development activities that involve controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, and biological and radioactive compounds. in the event of contamination or injury from the use of these hazardous materials, we could be held liable for damages that result. this liability could exceed our resources and any recovery available through any applicable insurance coverage, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
together with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or changes thereto, could adversely affect our business or our tenants' businesses and their ability to make rental payments to us.
our properties may have defects that are unknown to us.
although we thoroughly review the physical condition of our properties before they are acquired, and as they are developed or redeveloped, any of our properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could adversely affect the property's value or revenue potential.
our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs to remedy the problem.
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold may grow, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses, and bacteria. indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. as a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. in addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants, and others if property damage or health concerns arise.
we may not be able to obtain additional capital to further our business objectives.
our ability to acquire, develop, or redevelop properties depends upon our ability to obtain capital. the real estate industry has historically experienced periods of volatile debt and equity capital markets and/or periods of extreme illiquidity. a prolonged period in which we cannot effectively access the public debt or equity markets may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing sources to undertake new investments. an inability to obtain debt or equity capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from acquiring, financing, and completing desirable investments and could otherwise adversely affect our business. also, the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or interests in subsidiaries to fund future operations could dilute the ownership of our then-existing stockholders. even as liquidity returns to the market, debt and equity capital may be more expensive than in prior years.
we may not be able to sell our properties quickly to raise capital.
investments in real estate are relatively illiquid compared to other investments. accordingly, we may not be able to sell our properties when we desire or at prices acceptable to us in response to changes in economic or other conditions. in addition, the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "internal revenue code"), limits our ability to sell properties held for less than two years. these limitations on our ability to sell our properties may adversely affect our cash flows, our ability to repay debt, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing ability.
our credit ratings may affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and/or improve our current credit ratings. in the event that our current credit ratings are downgraded or removed, we would most likely incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty in obtaining additional financing, which in turn would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.
we may not be able to refinance our debt, and/or our debt may not be assumable.
due to the high volume of real estate debt financing in recent years, the real estate industry may require more funds to refinance debt maturities than are available from lenders. this potential shortage of available funds from lenders and stricter credit underwriting guidelines may limit our ability to refinance our debt as it matures or may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, and the market price of our common stock.
we may not be able to borrow additional amounts through the issuance of unsecured bonds or under our unsecured senior line of credit or commercial paper program.
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to access the unsecured bond market on favorable terms. our ability to borrow additional amounts through the issuance of unsecured bonds may be negatively impacted by periods of illiquidity in the bond market.
aggregate borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit require compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants. borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit are funded by a group of banks. our ability to borrow additional amounts under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program may be negatively impacted by a decrease in cash flows from our properties, a default or cross-default under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program, non-compliance with one or more loan covenants associated with our unsecured senior line of credit, and non-performance or failure of one or more lenders under our unsecured senior line of credit. in addition, we may not be able to refinance or repay outstanding borrowings on our unsecured senior line of credit or commercial paper program.
our inability to borrow additional amounts on an unsecured basis could delay us in or prevent us from acquiring, financing, and completing desirable investments, which could adversely affect our business; and our inability to refinance or repay amounts under our unsecured senior line of credit or commercial paper program may adversely affect our cash flows, ability to make distributions to our stockholders, financial condition, and results of operations.
if interest rates rise, our debt service costs will increase and the value of our properties may decrease.
our unsecured senior line of credit bears interest at variable rates, and we may incur additional variable-rate debt in the future. amounts issued under our commercial paper program typically mature in less than 30 days and no later than 397 days from the date of issuance and require repayment or refinancing upon maturity. increases in market interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt. additionally, increases in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our real estate and a decrease in the market price of our common stock. accordingly, these increases could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
our unsecured senior line of credit restricts our ability to engage in some business activities.
our unsecured senior line of credit contains customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that, among other things:
•restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;
•restrict our ability to make certain investments;
•restrict our ability to merge with another company;
•restrict our ability to make distributions to our stockholders;
•require us to maintain financial coverage ratios; and
•require us to maintain a pool of qualified unencumbered assets.
complying with these restrictions may prevent us from engaging in certain profitable activities and constrain our ability to effectively allocate capital. failure to comply with these restrictions may result in our defaulting on these and other loans, which would likely have a negative impact on our operations, financial condition, and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
our debt service obligations may have adverse consequences on our business operations.
we use debt to finance our operations, including the acquisition, development, and redevelopment of properties. our use of debt may have adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:
•our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest;
•we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on our debt;
•if we default on our debt obligations, the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure those loans;
•a foreclosure on one of our properties could create taxable income without any accompanying cash proceeds to pay the tax;
•a default under a loan that has cross-default provisions may cause us to automatically default on another loan;
•we may not be able to refinance or extend our existing debt;
•the terms of any refinancing or extension may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt;
•we may be subject to a significant increase in the variable interest rates on our unsecured senior line of credit or commercial paper program, which could adversely impact our cash flows and operations; and
•the terms of our debt obligations may require a reduction in our distributions to stockholders.
if our revenues are less than our expenses, we may have to borrow additional funds, and we may not be able to make distributions to our stockholders.
if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to cover our operating expenses, including our debt service obligations and capital expenditures, we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs and cash flow needs. this could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. factors that could adversely affect the revenues we generate from, and the values of, our properties include, but are not limited to, the following:
•national, local, and worldwide economic and political conditions;
•competition from other properties;
•changes in the life science, technology, and agtech industries;
•real estate conditions in our target markets;
•our ability to collect rent payments;
•the availability of financing;
•changes to the financial and banking industries;
•changes in interest rate levels;
•vacancies at our properties and our ability to re-lease space;
•changes in tax or other regulatory laws;
•the costs of compliance with government regulation;
•the lack of liquidity of real estate investments; and
•increases in operating costs.
in addition, if a lease at a property is not a triple net lease, we will have greater exposure to increases in expenses associated with operating that property. certain significant expenditures, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, are generally fixed and do not decrease when revenues at the related property decrease.
if we fail to effectively manage our debt obligations, we could become highly leveraged, and our debt service obligations could increase to unsustainable levels.
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. therefore, if we fail to prudently manage our capital structure, we could become highly leveraged. this would result in an increase in our debt service obligations that could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. higher leverage could also increase the risk of default on our debt obligations or may result in downgrades to our credit ratings.
failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance would likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
our expected financial results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. this may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
•the status of the economy;
•the status of capital markets, including availability and cost of capital;
•changes in financing terms available to us;
•negative developments in the operating results or financial condition of tenants, including, but not limited to, their ability to pay rent;
•our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as leases expire;
•our ability to reinvest sale proceeds in a timely manner at rates similar to the rate at which assets are sold;
•regulatory approval and market acceptance of the products and technologies of tenants;
•liability or contract claims by or against tenants;
•unanticipated difficulties and/or expenditures relating to future acquisitions;
•environmental laws affecting our properties;
•changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting; and
•other legal and operational matters, including reit qualification and key management personnel recruitment and retention.
failure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to earnings estimates, funds from operations per share, operating cash flows, and revenues, would likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our common stock or other outstanding securities.
the price per share of our stock may fluctuate significantly.
the market price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
•the availability and cost of debt and/or equity capital;
•the condition of our balance sheet;
•actual or anticipated capital requirements;
•the condition of the financial and banking industries;
•actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends;
•the amount and timing of debt maturities and other contractual obligations;
•changes in our net income, funds from operations, or guidance;
•the publication of research reports and articles about us, our tenants, the real estate industry, or the life science, technology, and agtech industries;
•the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other debt or equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate-based companies);
•general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed-income securities, that may lead prospective stockholders to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;
•fluctuations from general market volatility;
•changes in our analyst ratings;
•changes in our corporate credit ratings or credit ratings of our debt or other securities;
•changes in market valuations of similar companies;
•adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;
•additions, departures, or other announcements regarding our key management personnel;
•actions by institutional stockholders;
•speculation in the press or investment community;
•terrorist activity adversely affecting the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending;
•government regulatory action and changes in tax laws;
•fiscal policies or inaction at the u.s. federal government level that may lead to federal government shutdowns or negative impacts on the u.s. economy;
•global market factors adversely affecting the u.s. economic and political environment;
•the realization of any of the other risk factors included in this annual report on form 10-k; and
•general market and economic conditions.
many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business, or prospects.
possible future sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect its market price.
we cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of shares of our common stock or the market price of our common stock. sales of substantial amounts of capital stock (including the conversion or redemption of preferred stock), or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. refer to "other sources" in the "sources of capital" subsection of the "capital resources" section under "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k.
we have reserved a number of shares of common stock for issuance to our directors, officers, and employees pursuant to our amended and restated 1997 stock award and incentive plan (sometimes referred to herein as our "equity incentive plan"). we have filed a registration statement with respect to the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to grants under our equity incentive plan. in addition, any shares issued under our equity incentive plan will be available for sale in the public market from time to time without restriction by persons who are not our "affiliates" (as defined in rule 144 adopted under the securities act of 1933, as amended). affiliates will be able to sell shares of our common stock subject to restrictions under rule 144.
our distributions to stockholders may decline at any time.
we may not continue our current level of distributions to our stockholders. our board of directors will determine future distributions based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
•the amount of net cash provided by operating activities available for distribution;
•our financial condition and capital requirements;
•any decision to reinvest funds rather than to distribute such funds;
•our capital expenditures;
•the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code;
•restrictions under maryland law; and
•other factors our board of directors deems relevant.
a reduction in distributions to stockholders may negatively impact our stock price.
distributions on our common stock may be made in the form of cash, stock, or a combination of both.
as a reit, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders. typically, we generate cash for distributions through our operations, the disposition of assets, including partial interest sales, or the incurrence of additional debt. our board of directors may determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock in cash, in shares of our common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. for example, we may declare dividends payable in cash or stock at the election of each stockholder, subject to a limit on the aggregate cash that could be paid. any such dividends would be distributed in a manner intended to count in full toward the satisfaction of our annual distribution requirements and to qualify for the dividends paid deduction. while the irs privately has ruled that such a dividend would so qualify if certain requirements are met, no assurances can be provided that the irs would not assert a contrary position in the future. moreover, a reduction in the cash yield on our common stock may negatively impact our stock price.
we have certain ownership interests outside the u.s. that may subject us to risks different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations.
we have three operating properties in canada and one operating property in china. acquisition, development, redevelopment, ownership, and operating activities outside the u.s. involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. these risks include, but are not limited to:
•adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;
•challenges and/or taxation with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings or repatriation of proceeds from the sale of one or more of our foreign investments;
•changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions, including nationally, regionally, and locally;
•challenges in managing international operations;
•challenges in hiring or retaining key management personnel;
•challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment, and legal proceedings;
•differences in lending practices;
•differences in languages, cultures, and time zones;
•changes in applicable laws and regulations in the u.s. that affect foreign operations;
•challenges in managing foreign relations and trade disputes that adversely affect u.s. and foreign operations;
•future partial or complete u.s. federal government shutdowns, trade disagreements with other countries, or uncertainties that could affect business transactions within the u.s. and with foreign entities;
•changes in tax and local regulations with potentially adverse tax consequences and penalties; and
•foreign ownership and transfer restrictions.
in addition, our foreign investments are subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions based on local tax laws and regulations and on existing international tax treaties. we have invested in foreign markets under the assumption that our future earnings in each of those countries will be taxed at the current prevailing income tax rates. there are no guarantees that foreign governments will continue to honor existing tax treaties we have relied upon for our foreign investments or that the current income tax rates in those countries will not increase significantly, thus impacting our ability to repatriate our foreign investments and related earnings.
investments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with u.s. laws and regulations, including the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations. the foreign corrupt practices act and similar applicable anti-corruption laws prohibit individuals and entities from offering, promising, authorizing, or providing payments or anything of value, directly or indirectly, to government officials in order to obtain, retain, or direct business. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations or the value of our international investments. in addition, if we fail to effectively manage our international operations, our overall financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
furthermore, we may in the future enter into agreements with non-u.s. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution rules of, another country or region. in some cases, such a country or region might not have a forum that provides us an effective or efficient means for resolving disputes that may arise under these agreements.
we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures.
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in non-wholly owned partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint ventures. partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture investments involve certain risks, including, but not limited to, the following:
•upon bankruptcy of non-wholly owned partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint venture entities, we may become liable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture;
•we may share certain approval rights over major decisions with third parties;
•we may be required to contribute additional capital if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions;
•our partners, co-members, or joint venture partners might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and that could affect our ability to lease or re-lease the property, operate the property, or maintain our qualification as a reit;
•our ability to sell the interest on advantageous terms when we so desire may be limited or restricted under the terms of our agreements with our partners; and
•we may not continue to own or operate the interests or assets underlying such relationships or may need to purchase such interests or assets at an above-market price to continue ownership.
we generally seek to maintain control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint venture investments in a manner sufficient to permit us to achieve our business objectives. however, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, and the market price of our common stock.
we could incur significant costs due to the financial condition of our insurance carriers.
we insure our properties with insurance companies we believe have good ratings at the time our policies are put into effect. the financial condition of one or more of the insurance companies we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which can result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results. in addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the cost of renewing our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties.
our insurance may not adequately cover all potential losses.
if we experience a loss at any of our properties that is not covered by insurance, that exceeds our insurance policy limits, or that is subject to a policy deductible, we could lose the capital invested in the affected property and, possibly, future revenues from that property. in addition, we could continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the affected properties. all properties carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties, including properties partially owned through joint ventures that are managed by our joint venture partners.
we have obtained earthquake insurance for our properties that are located in the vicinity of active earthquake zones in an amount and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable. however, a significant portion of our real estate portfolio is located in seismically active regions, including san francisco, san diego, and seattle, and a damaging earthquake in any of these regions could significantly impact multiple properties. as a result, the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover our losses, and aggregate deductible amounts may be material, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. we also carry environmental insurance and title insurance policies for our properties. we generally obtain title insurance policies when we acquire a property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property.
our tenants are also required to maintain comprehensive insurance, including liability and casualty insurance that is customarily obtained for similar properties. there are, however, certain types of losses that we and our tenants do not generally insure against because they are uninsurable or because it is not economical to insure against them. the availability of coverage against certain types of losses, such as from terrorism or toxic mold, has become more limited and, when available, carries a significantly higher cost. we cannot predict whether insurance coverage against terrorism or toxic mold will remain available for our properties because insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against such losses, or such coverage, if offered, may become prohibitively expensive. we have not had material losses from terrorism or toxic mold at any of our properties.
the loss of services of any of our senior officers could adversely affect us.
we depend upon the services and contributions of relatively few senior officers. the loss of services or contributions of any one of them may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and prospects. we use the extensive personal and business relationships that members of our management have developed over time with owners of office/laboratory and tech office properties and with major tenants and venture investment portfolio companies in the life science, technology, and agtech industries. we cannot assure our stockholders that our senior officers will remain employed with us. in california and certain other regions where we have operations, there is intense competition for individuals with skill sets needed for our business. moreover, we expect that the high cost of living in california, where our headquarters and many of our properties are located, as a result of high state and local taxes and increased home prices, may impair our ability to attract and retain employees in the future. due to the long-term nature of our investments and properties, we are unable to predict and may be unable to effectively control such costs. if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel, our business may suffer, and we may be unable to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively.
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.
pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control. changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes. internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
if we failed to qualify as a reit, we would be taxed at corporate rates and would not be able to take certain deductions when computing our taxable income.
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code. if, in any taxable year, we failed to qualify as a reit:
•we would be subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;
•we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to our stockholders in computing taxable income;
•we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification, unless we were entitled to relief under the internal revenue code; and
•we would no longer be required by the internal revenue code to make distributions to our stockholders.
as a result of any additional tax liability, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate certain investments in order to pay the applicable tax. accordingly, funds available for investment or distribution to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years involved.
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and financial results, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. although we believe that we our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to qualify as a reit, we cannot assure our stockholders that we are or will remain so qualified.
from time to time, we dispose of properties in transactions qualified under section 1031 of the internal revenue code ("section 1031 exchanges"). if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined by the irs to be taxable or if we are unable to identify and complete the acquisition of a suitable replacement property to effect a section 1031 exchange or if the laws surrounding section 1031 exchanges are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax-deferred basis. in such a case, our earnings and profits and our taxable income would increase, which could increase the dividend income and reduce the return of capital to our stockholders. as a result, we may be required to pay additional dividends to stockholders, or if we do not pay additional dividends, our corporate income tax liability could increase and we may be subject to interest and penalties.
we may not be able to participate in certain sales that the irs characterizes as "prohibited transactions." the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions is a 100% tax on net income from the transaction. whether or not the transaction is characterized as a prohibited transaction is a factual matter. generally, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosures, characterized as held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. however, a sale will not be considered a prohibited transaction if it meets certain safe harbor requirements. although we do not intend to participate in prohibited transactions, there is no guarantee that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will meet the safe harbor requirements.
federal income tax rules are constantly under review by the u.s. congress and the irs. changes to tax laws could adversely affect our investors or our tenants, and we cannot predict how those changes may affect us in the future. new legislation, u.s. treasury department regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or an investment in our stock. also, laws relating to the tax treatment of investment in other types of business entities could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit.
we are dependent on third parties to manage the amenities at our properties.
we retain third-party managers to manage certain amenities at our properties, such as restaurants, conference centers, exercise facilities, and parking garages. our income from our properties may be adversely affected if these parties fail to provide quality services and amenities with respect to our properties. while we monitor the performance of these third parties, we may have limited recourse if we believe they are not performing adequately. in addition, these third-party managers may operate, and in some cases may own or invest in, properties that compete with our properties, which may result in conflicts of interest. as a result, these third-party managers may have made, and may in the future make, decisions that are not in our best interests.
we rely on a limited number of vendors to provide utilities and certain other services at our properties, and disruption in these services may have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
we rely on a limited number of vendors to provide key services, including, but not limited to, utilities and construction services, at certain of our properties. our business and property operations may be adversely affected if key vendors fail to adequately provide key services at our properties as a result of natural disasters (such as fires, floods, earthquakes, etc.), power interruptions, bankruptcies, war, acts of terrorism, public health emergencies, cyber attacks, pandemics, or other unanticipated catastrophic events. if a vendor encounters financial difficulty such as bankruptcy or other events beyond our control that cause it to fail to adequately provide utilities, construction, or other important services, we may experience significant interruptions in service and disruptions to business operations at our properties, incur remediation costs, and become subject to claims and damage to our reputation.
in addition, difficulties encountered by key vendors in providing necessary services at our properties could result in significant market rate increases for such services. our triple net leases allow us to pass through substantially all operating expenses and certain capital expenditures to our tenants in the form of additional rent. however, we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to negotiate pass-through provisions in tenant leases in the future, which could lead to a decrease in our recovery of operating expenses. if our operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish. also, we cannot be certain that increased costs will not lead our current or prospective tenants to seek space elsewhere, which could significantly hinder our ability to increase our rents or to maintain existing occupancy levels. additionally, this may significantly increase occupancy costs for some of our tenants and may adversely impact their financial condition, ability to make rental payments, and ability to renew their lease agreements.
pacific gas and electric company ("pg&e") is the primary public utility company providing electrical and gas service to residential and commercial customers in northern california, including the san francisco bay area. most of our properties located in our san francisco market depend on pg&e for the delivery of these essential services. pg&e initiated voluntary reorganization proceedings under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code in january 2019 in response to potential liabilities arising from a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in northern california in 2017 and 2018. while pg&e emerged from bankruptcy in july 2020, there is no guarantee that pg&e will be able to sustain safe operations and continue to provide consistent utilities services. during periods of high winds and high fire danger in recent fire seasons, pg&e preemptively shut off power to areas of central and northern california. the shutoffs were designed to help guard against fires ignited in areas with high winds and dry conditions. pg&e has warned that it may have to employ shutoffs while the utility company addresses maintenance issues. future shutoffs of power may impact the reliability of access to a stable power supply at our properties and, in turn, adversely impact our tenants' businesses. in addition, there is no guarantee that pg&e's safety measures mandated by regulators will be timely and sufficient to prevent future catastrophic wildfires.
the realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.
we may change our business policies without stockholder approval.
our board of directors determines all of our material business policies, with management's input, including those related to our:
•status as a reit;
•incurrence of debt and debt management activities;
•selective acquisition, disposition, development, and redevelopment activities;
•stockholder distributions; and
•other policies, as appropriate.
our board of directors may amend or revise these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders. a change in these policies could adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
there are limits on the ownership of our capital stock under which a stockholder may lose beneficial ownership of its shares and that may delay or prevent transactions that might otherwise be desired by our stockholders.
in order for a company to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code, not more than 50% of the value of its outstanding stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals or entities (as set forth in the internal revenue code) during the last half of a taxable year. furthermore, shares of our company's outstanding stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year.
in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, among other things, our charter provides for an ownership limit, which prohibits, with certain exceptions, direct or constructive ownership of shares of stock representing more than 9.8% of the combined total value of our outstanding shares of stock by any person, as defined in our charter. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive the ownership limit for any person. however, our board of directors may not grant such waiver if, after giving effect to such waiver, we would be "closely held" under section 856(h) of the internal revenue code. as a condition to waiving the ownership limit, our board of directors may require a ruling from the irs or an opinion of counsel in order to determine our status as a reit. notwithstanding the receipt of any such ruling or opinion, our board of directors may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with granting a waiver.
our charter further prohibits transferring shares of our stock if such transfer would result in our being "closely held" under section 856(h) of the internal revenue code or would result in shares of our stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons.
the constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of our common stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. a transfer of shares to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates these limits shall be void or these shares shall be exchanged for shares of excess stock and transferred to a trust for the benefit of one or more qualified charitable organizations designated by us. in that case, the intended transferee will have only a right to share, to the extent of the transferee's original purchase price for such shares, in proceeds from the trust's sale of those shares and will effectively forfeit its beneficial ownership of the shares. these ownership limits could delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the holders of our common stock or that might otherwise be desired by such holders.
in addition to the ownership limit, certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that may be deemed to be desirable to our stockholders.
as authorized by maryland law, our charter allows our board of directors to cause us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of common or preferred stock without any stockholder approval. our board of directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could delay, defer, or prevent a transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that might, for other reasons, be desired by our common stockholders, or a series of preferred stock that has a dividend preference that may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.
our charter permits the removal of a director only upon a two-thirds majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors, and our bylaws require advance notice of a stockholder's intention to nominate directors or to present business for consideration by stockholders at an annual meeting of our stockholders. our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or change in control that involves a premium price for our common stock or that, for other reasons, may be desired by our stockholders.
market and industry factors we face substantial competition in our target markets.
the significant competition for business in our target markets could have an adverse effect on our operations. we compete for investment opportunities with:
•other reits;
•insurance companies;
•pension and investment funds;
•private equity entities;
•partnerships;
•developers;
•investment companies;
•owners/occupants; and
•foreign investors, including sovereign wealth funds.
many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more than we can or accept more risk than we are willing to accept. these entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic concentration of their investments. competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. if there is no matching growth in demand, the intensified competition may lead to oversupply of available space comparable to ours and result in the pressure on rental rates and greater incentives awarded to tenants. to maintain our ability to retain current and attract new tenants, we may be forced to reduce the rental rates that our tenants are currently willing to pay or offer greater tenant concessions. should we encounter intensified competition or oversupply, we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully, maintain our occupancy and rental rates, and continue to expand our business. as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to pay dividends, and our stock price may be adversely affected.
poor economic conditions in our markets could adversely affect our business.
our properties are primarily located in the following markets:
•greater boston;
•san francisco;
•new york city;
•san diego;
•seattle;
•maryland; and
•research triangle.
as a result of our geographic concentration, we depend upon the local economic and real estate conditions in these markets. we are therefore subject to increased exposure (positive or negative) to economic, tax, and other competitive factors specific to markets in confined geographic areas. our operations may also be affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these markets. an economic downturn in any of these markets could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. we cannot assure our stockholders that these markets will continue to grow or remain favorable to the life science, technology, and agtech industries.
improvements to our properties are significantly more costly than improvements to traditional office space.
many of our properties generally contain infrastructure improvements that are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types. although we have historically been able to recover the additional investment in infrastructure improvements through higher rental rates, there is the risk that we will not be able to continue to do so in the future. typical improvements include:
•reinforced concrete floors;
•upgraded roof loading capacity;
•increased floor-to-ceiling heights;
•heavy-duty hvac systems;
•enhanced environmental control technology;
•significantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and
•laboratory benches.
we are dependent on the life science, technology, and agtech industries, and changes within these industries may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments, the value of our non-real estate investments, and our results of operations.
in general, our business strategy is to invest primarily in properties used by tenants in the life science, technology, and agtech industries. through our venture investment portfolio, we also hold investments in companies that, similar to our tenant base, are concentrated in the life science, technology, and agtech industries. our business could be adversely affected if the life science, technology, and agtech industries are impacted by an economic, financial, or banking crisis, or if the life science, technology, and agtech industries migrate from the u.s. to other countries. because of our industry focus, events within these industries may have a more pronounced effect on our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders than if we had more diversified investments. also, some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life science, technology, or agtech industry tenant and could require significant modification before we are able to re-lease space to another tenant. generally, our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office tenants without significant expenditures on renovations.
our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for office/laboratory and tech office space at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed.
it is common for businesses in the life science, technology, and agtech industries to undergo mergers or consolidations. mergers or consolidations of life science, technology, and agtech entities in the future could reduce the rsf requirements of our tenants and prospective tenants, which may adversely impact the demand for office/laboratory and tech office space and our future revenue from lease payments and our results of operations.
some of our current or future tenants may include high-tech companies in their startup or growth phases of their life cycle. fluctuations in market confidence vested in these companies or adverse changes in economic conditions may have a disproportionate effect on operations of such companies. deterioration in the financial conditions of our tenants may result in our inability to collect rental payments from them and therefore may negatively impact our results of operations.
our results of operations depend on our tenants' research and development efforts and their ability to obtain funding for these efforts.
our tenant base includes entities in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, life science, technology, agtech, and related industries; academic institutions; government institutions; and private foundations. our tenants base their research and development budgets on several factors, including the need to develop new products, the availability of government and other funding, competition, and the general availability of resources. our investments through our venture investment portfolio are also in companies that, similar to our tenant base, are concentrated in the life science, technology, and agtech industries.
research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, research priorities, general economic conditions, institutional and government budgetary limitations, and mergers and consolidations of entities. our business could be adversely impacted by a significant decrease in research and development expenditures by our tenants, our venture investment portfolio companies, or the life science, technology, and agtech industries.
our tenants also include research institutions whose funding is largely dependent on grants from government agencies, such as the nih, the national science foundation, and similar agencies or organizations. u.s. government funding of research and development is subject to the political process, which is often unpredictable. other programs, such as homeland security or defense, could be viewed by the government as higher priorities. additionally, proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other u.s. government agencies that fund research and development activities. additionally, the inability of the u.s. congress to enact a budget for a fiscal year or the occurrence of partial or complete u.s. federal government shutdowns may result in temporary closures of agencies such as the fda or nih, which could adversely affect business operations of our tenants who are dependent on government approvals and appropriations. any shift away from funding of research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may adversely impact our tenants' operations, which in turn may impact their demand for office/laboratory and tech office space and their ability to make lease payments to us and thus adversely impact our results of operations.
our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies are subject to a number of risks unique to their industry, including (i) changes in technology, patent expiration, and intellectual property protection, (ii) high levels of regulation, (iii) failures in the safety and efficacy of their products, and (iv) significant funding requirements for product research and development. these risks may adversely affect our tenants' ability to make rental payments or satisfy their other lease obligations to us or may impact our venture investment portfolio companies' value and consequently may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.
changes in technology, patent expiration, and intellectual property rights and protection
•our tenants and venture investment portfolio companies develop and sell products and services in an industry that is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements, evolving industry standards, and uncertainty over the implementation of new healthcare reform legislation, which may cause them to lose competitive positions and adversely affect their operations.
•many of our tenants and venture investment portfolio companies, and their licensors, require patent, copyright, or trade secret protection and/or rights to use third-party intellectual property to develop, make, market, and sell their products and technologies. a tenant or venture investment portfolio company may be unable to commercialize its products or technologies if patents covering such products or technologies are not issued or are successfully challenged, narrowed, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. additionally, a third party may own intellectual property that limits a tenant's or venture investment portfolio company's ability to bring to market its product or technology without securing a license or other rights to use the third-party intellectual property, which may require the tenant to pay an upfront fee or royalty. failure to obtain these rights from third parties may make it challenging or impossible for a tenant or venture investment portfolio company to develop and commercialize its products or technologies, which could adversely affect its competitive position and operations.
•many of our tenants and venture investment portfolio companies depend upon patents to provide exclusive marketing rights for their products. as their product patents expire, competitors of these tenants or venture investment portfolio companies may be able to legally produce and market products similar to those products of our tenants or venture investment portfolio companies, which could have a material adverse effect on their sales and results of operations.
high levels of regulation
•some of our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies develop and manufacture drugs that require regulatory approval, including approval from the fda, prior to being made, marketed, sold, and used. the regulatory approval process to manufacture and market drugs is costly, typically takes many years, requires validation through clinical trials and the use of substantial resources, and is often unpredictable. a tenant or venture investment portfolio company may fail to obtain or may experience significant delays in obtaining these approvals. even if the tenant or venture investment portfolio company obtains regulatory approvals, marketed products will be subject to ongoing regulatory review and potential loss of approvals.
•the ability of some of our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies to commercialize any future products successfully will depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by government authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payers. additionally, reimbursements may decrease in the future.
failures in the safety and efficacy of their products
•some of our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies developing potential products may find that their products are not effective, or are even harmful, when tested in humans.
•some of our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies depend upon the commercial success of certain products. even if a product made by a life science industry tenant or venture investment portfolio company is successfully developed and proven safe and effective in human clinical trials, and the requisite regulatory approvals are obtained, subsequent discovery of safety issues with these products could cause product liability events, additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, loss of approval, withdrawal of products from the market, and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties.
•a drug made by a life science industry tenant or venture investment portfolio company may not be well accepted by doctors and patients, or may be less effective or accepted than a competitor's drug, even if it is successfully developed.

the companies in which we invest through our non-real estate venture investment portfolio expose us to risks similar to those of our tenant base and additional risks inherent in venture capital investing, which could materially affect our reported asset and liability values and earnings, and may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations.
through our strategic venture investment portfolio, we hold investments in companies that, similar to our tenant base, are concentrated in the life science, technology, and agtech industries. the venture investment portfolio companies in which we invest are accordingly subject to risks similar to those posed by our tenant base, including those disclosed in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, the companies in which we invest through our venture investment portfolio are subject to the risks inherent in venture capital investing and may be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control and other risks, including, but not limited to the following:
•risks inherent in venture capital investing, which typically focuses on relatively new and small companies with unproven technologies and limited access to capital and is therefore generally considered more speculative than investment in larger, more established companies;
•market disruption and volatility, which may adversely affect the value of the companies in which we hold equity investments and, in turn, our ability to realize gains upon sales of these investments.
•disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets and global economy, which may impact the ability of the companies in which we invest to raise additional capital or access capital from venture capital investors or financial institutions on favorable terms;
•liquidity of the companies in which we invest, which may (i) impede our ability to realize the value at which these investments are carried if we are required to dispose of them, (ii) make it difficult for us to sell these investments on a timely basis, and (iii) impair the value of such investments;
•changes in the political climate, potential reforms and changes to government negotiation and regulation, the effect of healthcare reform legislation, including those that may limit pricing of pharmaceutical products and drugs, market prices and conditions, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, the manufacturing and distribution of new products, product safety and efficacy issues, and new collaborative agreements, all of which may affect the valuation, funding opportunities, business operations, and financial results of the companies in which we invest;
•changes in u.s. federal government organizations or other agencies, including changes in policy, regulations, budgeting, retention of key leadership and other personnel, administration of drug approvals or restrictions on drug product or service development or commercialization, or a partial or complete future government shutdown resulting in temporary closures of agencies such as the fda and sec, could adversely affect the companies in which we invest, including delays in the commercialization of such companies' products, decreased funding of research and development in the life science, technology, and agtech industries, or delays surrounding approval of budget proposals for any of these industries;
•impacts or changes in business in connection with the covid-19 pandemic or for other reasons, including diversion of healthcare resources away from clinical trials, delays, or difficulties enrolling patients or maintaining scheduled appointments in clinical trials, interruptions, and delays in laboratory research due to the reduction in employee resources stemming from social distancing requirements and the desire of employees to avoid contact with people, insufficient inventory of supplies and reagents necessary for laboratory research due to interruptions in supply chain, delays or difficulties obtaining clinical site locations or engaging clinical site staff, interruptions on clinical site monitoring due to travel restrictions, delays in interacting with or receiving approval from regulatory agencies in connection with research activities or clinical trials, and disruptions to manufacturing facilities and supply lines;
•reduction in revenue or revenue growth, including in connection with the covid-19 pandemic, deterioration in the global economy, or other reasons, may impair the value of the companies in which we hold equity investments or impede their ability to raise additional capital; and
•seasonal weather conditions, changes in availability of transportation or labor, especially in connection with the covid-19 pandemic, and other related factors may affect the products and services or the availability of the products and services of the companies in which we invest in the agtech sector.
many of the factors listed above are beyond our control and, if the venture investment portfolio companies are adversely affected by any of the foregoing, could materially affect our reported asset and liability values and earnings and may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. the occurrence of any of these adverse events could cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline regardless of the performance of our primary real estate business.
market and other external factors may adversely impact the valuation of our equity investments.
we hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies, limited partnerships, and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science, technology, and agtech industries through our venture investment portfolio. the valuation of these investments is affected by many external factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, market prices, market conditions, the effect of healthcare reform legislation, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, the manufacturing and distribution of new products, product safety and efficacy issues, and new collaborative agreements. in addition, partial or complete future government shutdowns that may result in temporary closures of agencies such as the fda and sec may adversely affect the processing of initial public offerings, business operations, financial results, and funding for projects of the companies in which we hold equity investments. unfavorable developments with respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the valuation of our equity investments.
market and other external factors may negatively impact the liquidity of our equity investments.
we make and hold investments in privately held life science, technology, and agtech companies through our venture investment portfolio. these investments may be illiquid, which could impede our ability to realize the value at which these investments are carried if we are required to dispose of them. the lack of liquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments on a timely basis and may impair the value of these investments. if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of these investments quickly, we may realize significantly less than the amounts at which we had previously valued these investments.
government factors negative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of federal income tax policy, debt policy, and government spending may adversely affect our results of operations.
global macroeconomic conditions affect our tenants' businesses. instability in the banking and government sectors of the u.s. and/or the negative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of government tax policy, debt policy, and government spending, may have an adverse effect on the overall economic growth and our future revenue growth and profitability. volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions could undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets and cause our tenants to reduce or defer their spending, which would negatively affect our business. growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time. differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographic regions in which we operate and the industries we serve may in the future affect demand for our services. our revenues and profitability are derived from our tenants in north america, some of which derive significant revenues from their international operations. ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty affects our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and to effectively build our revenue and spending plans. economic volatility and uncertainty are particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and resulting changes in demand patterns to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. these risks may impact our overall liquidity, our borrowing costs, or the market price of our common stock.
monetary policy actions by the u.s. federal reserve could adversely impact our financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
during 2017-2018, the u.s. federal reserve gradually increased the target range for the federal funds rate. as of december 31, 2018, the federal funds rate was set at a range from 2.25% to 2.50%. from august 2019 through march 2020, the u.s. federal reserve initiated a series of rate cuts. as of december 31, 2020, the federal funds rate was set at a range from 0% to 0.25%. the u.s. federal reserve has not indicated any intention to continue to cut the federal funds rate, nor to raise the rate. should the u.s. federal reserve raise the rate in the future, this will likely result in an increase in market interest rates, which may increase our interest expense under our variable-rate borrowings and the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt. in addition, increases in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our real estate and a decrease in the market price of our common stock. increases in market interest rates may also adversely affect the securities markets generally, which could reduce the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. any such unfavorable changes to our borrowing costs and stock price could significantly impact our ability to raise new debt and equity capital going forward.
changes to the u.s. tax laws could have a significant negative impact on the overall economy, our tenants, and our business.
changes to u.s. tax laws that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact the overall economy, government revenues, the real estate industry, our tenants, and us, in ways that cannot be reliably predicted. furthermore, any future changes to u.s. tax laws may negatively impact certain of our tenants' operating results, financial condition, and future business plans. such changes to the tax laws may also result in reduced government revenues, and therefore reduced government spending, which may negatively impact some of our tenants that rely on government funding. for example, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was enacted on december 20, 2017, and significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21% for tax years beginning in 2018, imposing additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, changing the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, allowing for the expensing of certain capital expenditures, and implementing a modified territorial system. we are currently unable to predict whether any future changes will occur and any impact such changes could have on our operating results, financial condition, and future business operations.
actual and anticipated changes to the regulations of the healthcare system may have a negative impact on the pricing of drugs, the cost of healthcare coverage, and the reimbursement of healthcare services and products.
the fda and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many critical activities of life science, technology, and healthcare industries, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting, and product risk management. in both domestic and foreign markets, sales of products depend in part on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third-party payers, including governments and private health plans. governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement, and pricing of products to control cost or affect utilization of products. private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. substantial uncertainty exists regarding the reimbursement by third-party payers of newly approved healthcare products. the u.s. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect healthcare coverage and costs. such reforms may include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of healthcare services and products. in particular, there have been judicial and congressional challenges to the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively, the "aca"), which could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare terms and services covered by plans authorized by the aca. during 2017 several attempts were made to amend the aca; however, no amendment proposal gained the 50-vote support from the u.s. senate needed to pass a repeal bill. as a result, in october 2017, u.s. president trump issued an executive order, "promoting healthcare choice and competition across the united states" (the "executive order"). it is expected that the biden administration will repeal the executive order, but it is unknown what other changes the new administration will implement through the u.s. congress or future executive orders and how these would impact our tenants. government and other regulatory oversight and future regulatory and government interference with the healthcare systems may adversely impact our tenants' businesses and our business.
u.s. government tenants may not receive anticipated appropriations, which could hinder their ability to pay us.
u.s. government tenants are subject to government funding. if one or more of our u.s. government tenants fail to receive anticipated appropriations, we may not be able to collect rental amounts due to us. a significant reduction in federal government spending, particularly a sudden decrease due to the recent tax reform or to a sequestration process, which has occurred in recent years, could also adversely affect the ability of these tenants to fulfill lease obligations or decrease the likelihood that they will renew their leases with us. in addition, recent budgetary pressures have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities, such as the nih. for example, the nih budget has been, and may continue to be, significantly impacted by the sequestration provisions of the budget control act of 2011, which became effective on march 1, 2013. past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced nih and other research and development budgets. any shift away from the funding of research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our tenants to default on rental payments or delay or forgo leasing our rental space, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. additionally, the inability of the u.s. congress to enact a budget for a future fiscal year or the occurrence of partial or complete u.s. federal government shutdowns could adversely impact demand for our services by limiting federal funding available to our tenants and their customers. in addition, defaults under leases with u.s. government tenants are governed by federal statute and not by state eviction or rent deficiency laws. as of december 31, 2020, leases with u.s. government tenants at our properties accounted for approximately 1.2% of our aggregate annual rental revenue in effect as of december 31, 2020.
some of our tenants may be subject to increasing government price controls and other healthcare cost-containment measures.
government healthcare cost-containment measures can significantly affect our tenants' revenue and profitability. in many countries outside the u.s., government agencies strictly control, directly or indirectly, the prices at which our pharmaceutical industry tenants' products are sold. in a number of european union ("eu") member states, the pricing and/or reimbursement of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to governmental control, and legislators, policymakers, and healthcare insurance funds continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures to keep healthcare costs down, due in part to the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the eu. in the u.s., our pharmaceutical industry tenants are subject to substantial pricing pressures from state medicaid programs, private insurance programs, and pharmacy benefit managers. in addition, many state legislative proposals could further negatively affect pricing and/or reimbursement for our pharmaceutical industry tenants' products. also, the pricing environment for pharmaceuticals continues to be in the political spotlight in the u.s. pharmaceutical and medical device product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform. some states have implemented, and other states are considering, pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations who are not medicaid eligible. we anticipate that pricing pressures from both governments and private payers inside and outside the u.s. will become more severe over time.
changes in u.s. federal government funding for the fda, the nih, and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, properly administer drug innovation, or prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized by our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies, which could negatively impact our business.
the ability of the fda to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels, the ability to hire and retain key personnel, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. in addition, government funding of the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.
the ability of the fda, the nih, and other government agencies to properly administer their functions is highly dependent on the levels of government funding and the ability to fill key leadership appointments, among various factors. delays in filling or replacing key positions could significantly impact the ability of the fda, the nih, and other agencies to fulfill their functions and could greatly impact healthcare and the drug industry.
in december 2016, the 21st century cures act was signed into law. this legislation is designed to advance medical innovation and empower the fda with the authority to directly hire positions related to drug and device development and review. in the past, the fda was often unable to offer key leadership candidates (including scientists) competitive compensation packages as compared to those offered by private industry. the 21st century cures act is designed to streamline the agency's hiring process and enable the fda to compete for leadership talent by expanding the narrow ranges that are provided in prior compensation structures.
however, any future government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits may include reduced allocations to the fda, the nih, and other related government agencies. these budgetary pressures may result in a reduced ability by the fda and the nih to perform their respective roles and may have a related impact on academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is fully or partially dependent on both the level and the timing of funding from government sources.
in october 2020, u.s. president trump signed a stopgap spending bill in order to extend government funding until december 11, 2020. this bill provided necessary funding to government agencies until more fulsome appropriations were approved to provide funding for the remainder of the 2021 fiscal year. in december 2020, the u.s. congress passed additional stopgap bills before finally enacting a budget for the 2021 fiscal year on december 27, 2020. it is unclear whether the u.s. federal government will fail to enact a budget in future fiscal years, and if so, it is possible another partial government shutdown similar to the one that took place from december 22, 2018, to january 25, 2019, may occur. if this occurs, the fda and certain other science agencies may temporarily shut down select non-essential operations. also, as was the case in the last government shutdown, the fda may maintain only operations deemed to be essential public health-related functions and halt the acceptance of new medical product applications and routine regulatory and compliance work for medical products and certain drugs and foods during any shutdown.
disruptions at the fda and other agencies, such as those resulting from a government shutdown, or uncertainty from stopgap spending bills may slow the time necessary for new drugs and devices to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies and the healthcare and drug industries' ability to deliver new products to the market in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our tenants' operating results and business. interruptions to the function of the fda and other government agencies could adversely affect the demand for office/laboratory space and significantly impact our operating results and our business.
changes in laws and regulations that control drug pricing for government programs may adversely impact our operating results and our business.
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ("cms") is the federal agency within the u.s. department of health and human services that administers the medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer medicaid. the medicare modernization act of 2003 that went into effect on january 1, 2006 (which also made changes to the public part c medicare health plan program), explicitly prohibits government entities from directly negotiating drug prices with manufacturers. recently, there has been significant public outcry against price increases viewed to be unfair and unwarranted.
currently, the outcome of potential reforms and changes to government negotiation/regulation to drug pricing is unknown. changes in policy that limit prices may reduce the financial incentives for the research and development efforts that lead to discovery and production of new therapies and solutions to life-threatening conditions. negative impacts of new policies could adversely affect our tenants' and venture investment portfolio companies' businesses, including life science, technology, and agtech companies, which may reduce the demand for office/laboratory space and negatively impact our operating results and our business.
the provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd-frank act") may subject us to substantial additional federal regulation and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
there are significant corporate governance- and executive compensation-related provisions in the dodd-frank act that required the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. for example, the dodd-frank act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called "golden parachute" payments. our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management's time from other business activities. in addition, provisions of the dodd-frank act that directly affect other participants in the real estate and capital markets, such as banks, investment funds, and interest rate hedge providers, could have indirect, but material, impacts on our business. in 2018, several changes were made to the dodd-frank act, including the repeal of certain provisions that eased restrictions on small and medium-sized banks of the dodd-frank act. it is expected that the biden administration will reverse a number of u.s. president trump's policies, includes those that relate to deregulation, and will increase the number of financial regulators as current vacancies in the bureaucracy are prioritized and filled under the new administration.
many of the provisions of the dodd-frank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities. given the uncertainty associated with the dodd-frank act itself and the manner in which its provisions are implemented by various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our future operations is unclear. the provisions of the dodd-frank act may impact the profitability of business activities, require changes to certain business practices, or otherwise adversely affect our business in general. the dodd-frank act, including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals directed at the financial or real estate industry or affecting taxation that are proposed or pending in the u.s. congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework within which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable. the dodd-frank act also has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, substantial changes and dislocations in the banking industry and the financial services sector in ways that could have significant effects on, for example, the availability and pricing of unsecured credit, commercial mortgage credit, and derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, which are important aspects of our business. accordingly, new laws, regulations, and accounting standards, as well as changes to, or new interpretations of, currently accepted accounting practices in the real estate industry, may adversely affect our results of operations.
global factors changes in the method of determining libor, or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.
from time to time, we utilize interest rate hedge agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates. historically, our interest rate hedge agreements primarily related to our borrowings with variable interest rates based on libor. beginning in 2008, concerns were raised that some of the member banks surveyed by the bba in connection with the calculation of daily libor across a range of maturities and currencies may have underreported, overreported, or otherwise manipulated the interbank lending rate applicable to them in order to profit on their derivatives positions or to avoid an appearance of capital insufficiency or adverse reputational or other consequences that might have resulted from reporting interbank lending rates higher than those they actually submitted. a number of bba member banks have entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to alleged manipulation of libor, and investigations have been instigated by regulators and government authorities in various jurisdictions. other member banks may also enter into such settlements with, or have proceedings brought by, their regulators or law enforcement agencies in the future. if manipulation of libor occurred, it may have resulted in libor having been artificially lower (or higher) than it would otherwise have been. any such manipulation could have occurred over a substantial period of time.
on september 28, 2012, british regulators published a report on the review of libor. the report concluded that libor should be retained as a benchmark but recommended a comprehensive reform of libor, including replacing the bba with a new independent administrator of libor. based on this report, final rules for the regulation and supervision of libor by the financial conduct authority ("fca") were published and came into effect on april 2, 2013 (the "fca rules"). in particular, the fca rules include requirements that (i) an independent libor administrator monitor and survey libor submissions to identify breaches of practice standards and/or potentially manipulative behavior and (ii) firms submitting data to libor establish and maintain a clear conflict-of-interest policy and appropriate systems and controls. in response, ice benchmark administration limited ("iba") was appointed as the independent libor administrator, effective in early 2014. on july 27, 2017, the fca announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021. on november 18, 2020, iba announced it would consult on its intention to cease the publication of all gbp, eur, chf, and jpy libor settings and the one-week and two-month usd libor tenors immediately following the libor publication on december 31, 2021. on november 30, 2020, iba announced an extension of the libor transition deadline to june 30, 2023, rather than december 31, 2021, for the overnight and one-, three-, six-, and twelve-month usd libor. these decisions are subject to consultation, and announcements of the official cessation of any libor settings will be made separately.
in addition, in november 2014, the u.s. federal reserve established a working group composed of large u.s. financial institutions, the alternative reference rates committee ("arrc"), to identify a set of alternative interest reference rates to libor. in a may 2016 interim report, the arrc narrowed its choice to two libor alternatives. the first choice was the overnight bank funding rate ("obfr"), which consists of domestic and foreign unsecured borrowing in u.s. dollars. the u.s. federal reserve has been calculating and publishing the obfr since march 2016. the second alternative rate to libor was the treasury general collateral rate, which is composed of repo transactions secured by treasuries or other assets accepted as collateral by the majority of intermediaries in the repo market.
in june 2017, the arrc selected the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"), a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by u.s. treasury securities, as its preferred replacement for u.s. dollar libor. sofr is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast to libor under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. given that sofr is a secured rate backed by government securities, it does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with libor). sofr is therefore likely to be lower than libor and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. the first publication of sofr was released by the federal reserve bank of new york in april 2018.
in april 2019, the arrc published its recommendations on fallback language for syndicated loans, which the arrc encourages companies to use in new contracts that reference libor in order to minimize market disruptions when libor ceases to exist. the arrc suggested two alternative fallback language approaches for syndicated loan contracts:
•"hardwired approach," which clearly specifies the sofr-based successor rate and spread adjustment to be used when libor ceases to exist.
•"amendment approach," which, unlike the hardwired approach, does not reference specific rates or spread adjustments but provides a streamlined amendment approach for negotiating a benchmark replacement and introduces clarity with respect to the fallback trigger events and an adjustment to be applied to the successor rate.
in november 2020, the arrc published best practice recommendations that new libor cash products should have robust fallback language as soon as possible and new use of libor should cease altogether.
since 2012, we have been closely monitoring developments related to the transition away from libor and have implemented numerous proactive measures to minimize the potential impact of the transition to the company, specifically:
•we have proactively reduced outstanding libor-based borrowings under our unsecured senior bank term loans and secured construction loans through repayments. from january 2017 to december 2020, we retired approximately $1.5 billion of such debt.
•we continue to prudently manage outstanding borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, our only libor-based debt (excluding $12.7 million libor-based debt held by one of our unconsolidated joint ventures as of december 31, 2020). as of december 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit.
•our unsecured senior line of credit contains fallback language generally consistent with the arrc's amendment approach, which provides a streamlined amendment approach for negotiating a benchmark replacement and introduces clarity with respect to the fallback trigger events and an adjustment to be applied to the successor rate.
•we continue to monitor developments by the arrc and other governing bodies involved in libor transition.
we continue to be proactive in managing the risk of disruption associated with the cessation of libor; however, it is not possible to predict the effect of the fca rules, any changes in the methods pursuant to which libor is determined, the administration of libor by iba, and any other reforms to libor that will be enacted in the united kingdom and elsewhere. in addition, any changes announced by the fca, the bba, iba, the arrc, or any other successor governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted by such body, in the method pursuant to which libor is determined, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor, which could have an adverse impact on the level of the index. fluctuation or discontinuation of libor would affect our interest expense and earnings and the fair value of certain of our financial instruments. we also have certain joint ventures that may require variable-rate construction loans with interest based upon libor plus a spread. from time to time, we utilize interest rate hedge agreements to mitigate our exposure to such interest rate risk on a portion of our debt obligations. however, there is no assurance these arrangements will be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.
it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. when libor ceases to exist, we may need to amend the credit and loan agreements with our lenders that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate based on a new standard that is established, if any. the transition to an alternative rate will require careful and deliberate consideration and implementation so as to not disrupt the stability of financial markets. there is no guarantee that a transition from libor to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.
the transition to sofr may present challenges, including, but not limited to, the illiquidity of sofr derivatives markets, which could make it difficult for financial institutions to offer sofr-based debt products, the determination of the spread adjustment required to convert libor to sofr (and the related determination of a term structure with different maturities), and the greater volatility of sofr compared to that of libor. although daily pricing resets for sofr have been noted to be more volatile than that of libor, especially at month end, there is no sufficient evidence to establish how sofr volatility compares to that of libor. whether or not sofr attains market acceptance as a libor replacement tool remains in question. as such, the future of libor and potential alternatives at this time remains uncertain.
the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, or covid-19, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could adversely impact or cause disruption to our financial condition and results of operations. further, the spread of covid-19 has caused severe disruptions in the u.s. and global economies, may further disrupt financial markets, and could create widespread business continuity issues.
in recent years, the outbreaks of a number of diseases, including avian influenza, h1n1, and various other "superbugs," have increased the risk of a pandemic. in december 2019, covid-19 was reported to have surfaced in wuhan, china. covid-19 has since spread around the globe, including the u.s. covid-19 has been reported in every state in the u.s., including those where we own and operate our properties, have executive offices, and conduct principal operations. on march 11, 2020, the world health organization declared covid-19 a pandemic, and on march 13, 2020, the u.s. declared a national emergency with respect to covid-19.
the potential impact and duration of the covid-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant adverse impact across regional and global economies and financial markets. the global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and as new cases of the virus have continued, particularly in the u.s., countries around the world and states around the u.s., have reacted by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel.
almost every state implemented some form of shelter-in-place or stay-at-home directive between march and may 2020, including, among others, the cities of boston, san francisco (including five other san francisco bay area counties), and seattle, and the states of california, maryland, massachusetts, and new york, where we own properties. the lockdown restrictions implemented included quarantines, restrictions on travel, shelter-in-place orders, school closures, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on types of construction projects that could continue. these quarantines generally came with exceptions for essential healthcare/public health operations; health manufacturing; clinical research, development, and testing for covid-19; research and laboratory activities; essential manufacturing for pharmaceuticals, vaccines, testing materials, laboratory supplies, medical equipment, instruments; and safety products; essential retail, including pharmacies; essential building services, such as cleaning and maintenance; skilled trades, such as plumbers and electricians; and certain essential construction projects.
beginning in early may 2020, parts of the u.s. began to ease the lockdown restrictions and allow for the reopening of businesses. the gradual reopening of retail, manufacturing, and office facilities came with required or recommended safety protocols. due to the increase in the number of covid-19 cases subsequent to the reopening, in november 2020, parts of the u.s. have implemented additional stay-at-home and lockdown restrictions. additionally, in recent months, new covid-19 variants were discovered in the united kingdom ("u.k."), among other countries, which have spread globally, including the u.s. while these strains do not appear to cause more severe symptoms in individuals, they have spread faster and more easily upon contact. as a result, more stringent lockdown restrictions have been implemented in regions globally and within the u.s. it is unknown when easing of these lockdowns and another reopening will occur even as covid-19 vaccines become available across the u.s. via emergency use authorization ("eua") by the fda. there is no assurance that the reopening of businesses, even if those businesses adhere to recommended safety protocols, will enable us or many of our tenants to avoid adverse effects on our and our tenants' operations and businesses.
as of the date of this report, all our ground-up development projects undergoing construction have resumed construction. new lockdowns instituted by local and state governments may cause our construction projects to have to pause, causing delays on our expected future deliveries. construction workers are also practicing social distancing and following rules that restrict gathering of large groups of people in close proximity, as well as other appropriate practices, that may slow the pace of construction.
although critical research and development efforts are continuing in our office/laboratory properties, in certain cases such research and development efforts have fewer workers, and non-critical workers in these buildings and most office buildings are working remotely. when appropriate, certain spaces have been and may continue to be subject to temporary closure for quarantine and proper disinfecting. our properties and tenant base include a small amount of restaurant, conference center, fitness centers, and retail space, which accounts for approximately 0.5% of our annual rental revenues as of december 31, 2020. retail tenants in particular continue to be severely impacted by stay-at-home and lockdown restrictions and social distancing protocols that remain in place across all of the markets where our properties are located.
the covid-19 outbreak has already had a significant adverse impact on the economies of the world, including that of the u.s., and this pandemic, and future pandemics, could trigger a period of prolonged global economic slowdown or recession.
the effects of covid-19 or another pandemic on our (or our tenants') ability to successfully operate could be adversely impacted due to, among other factors:
•the continued service and availability of personnel, including our executive officers and other leaders that are part of our management team, and our ability to recruit, attract, and retain skilled personnel. to the extent our management or personnel are impacted in significant numbers by the outbreak of pandemic or epidemic disease and are not available or allowed to conduct work, our business and operating results may be negatively impacted;
•our (or our tenants') ability to operate, generally or in affected areas, or delays in the supply of products or services from our vendors that are necessary for us to operate effectively;
•our tenants' ability to pay rent on their leases in full and timely and, to the extent necessary, our inability to restructure our tenants' long-term rent obligations on terms favorable to us or to timely recapture the space for re-leasing (refer to the risk factor on the next page within this item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k);
•difficulty in our accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets, or deterioration in credit and financing conditions, which may affect our (or our tenants') ability to access capital necessary to fund business operations or replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis and may adversely affect the valuation of financial assets and liabilities, any of which could affect our (or our tenants') ability to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows;
•complete or partial closures of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our offices or properties resulting from government action or directives;
•our (or our tenants') ability to continue or complete construction as planned for our tenants' operations, or delays in the supply of materials or labor necessary for construction, which may affect our (or our tenants') ability to complete construction or to complete it timely, our ability to prevent a lease termination, and our ability to collect rent, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows;
•the cost of implementing precautionary measures against covid-19, including, but not limited to, potential additional health insurance and labor-related costs;
•governmental efforts (such as moratoriums on or suspensions of eviction proceedings) that may affect our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure of our tenants to pay rent;
•uncertainty related to whether the u.s. congress or state legislatures will pass additional laws providing for additional economic stimulus packages, governmental funding, or other relief programs, whether such measures will be enacted, whether our tenants will be eligible or will apply for any such funds, whether the funds, if available, could be used by our tenants to pay rent, and whether such funds will be sufficient to supplement our tenants' rent and other obligations to us;
•deterioration of global economic conditions and job losses, which may decrease demand for and occupancy levels of our rental properties and may cause our rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;
•our dependence on short-term and long-term debt sources, including our unsecured senior line of credit, commercial paper program, and senior notes, which may affect our ability to continue our investing activities and make distributions to our stockholders;
•declines in the valuation of our properties, which may affect our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of debt funding;
•declines in the valuation of our venture investment portfolio, which may (i) impede our ability to realize the value at which these investments are carried if we are required to dispose of them, (ii) make it difficult for us to sell these investments on a timely basis, and (iii) impair the value of such investments;
•refusal or failure by one or more of our lenders under our credit facility to fund their financing commitment to us, which we may not be able to replace on favorable terms, or at all;
•to the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments, one or more counterparties to our derivative financial instruments could default on their obligations to us or could fail, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of utilizing these instruments;
•any possession taken of our properties, in whole or in part, by governmental authorities for public purposes in eminent domain proceedings;
•our level of insurance coverage and recovery we receive under any insurance we maintain, which may be delayed by, or insufficient to fully offset potential/actual losses caused by, covid-19;
•any increase in insurance premiums and imposition of large deductibles;
•our level of dependence on the internet, as it relates to employees' working remotely, and increases in malware campaigns and phishing attacks preying on the uncertainties surrounding covid-19, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber attacks;
•our ability to ensure business continuity in the event our continuity of operations plan is not effective or is improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption; and
•our ability to operate, which may cause our business and operating results to decline or may impact our ability to comply with regulatory obligations and may lead to reputational harm and regulatory issues or fines.
while the rapid development and fluidity of the covid-19 pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of covid-19, the spread of covid-19 has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of the global financial market and an increase in unemployment in the u.s. although the fda has approved certain therapies and two vaccines for emergency use and distribution to certain groups of individuals as of the date of this report, (i) the initial rollout of vaccine distribution has encountered significant delays, and (ii) there remain uncertainties as to the amount of vaccine available for distribution, the logistics of implementing a national vaccine program, and the overall efficacy of the vaccines once widely administered, especially as new strains of covid-19 have been discovered, and the level of resistance these new strains have to the existing vaccines, if any, remains unknown. until such therapies and vaccines are widely available and effective, the pandemic and public and private responses to the pandemic may lead to deterioration of economic conditions, an economic downturn, and/or a recession, at a global scale, which could materially affect our (or our tenants') performance, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, or covid-19, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could adversely impact or cause disruption to our tenants' financial condition and results of operations, which may adversely impact our ability to generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses or generate income and capital appreciation.
our tenants, many of which conduct business in the life science, technology, or agtech industries, may incur significant costs or losses responding to the outbreak of a contagious disease (such as covid-19), lose business due to interruption in their operations, or incur other liabilities related to shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, infection, or other related factors. tenants that experience deteriorating financial conditions as a result of the outbreak of a contagious disease, or the covid-19 pandemic, may be unwilling or unable to pay rent in full or timely due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures, or other reasons. our tenants' defaults and delayed or partial rental payments could adversely impact our rental revenues and operating results.
the negative effects of an outbreak of a contagious disease on our tenants in the life science industry may include, but are not limited to:
•delays or difficulties in enrolling patients or maintaining scheduled study visits in clinical trials;
•delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;
•diversion of healthcare resources away from clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our tenants' clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our tenants' clinical trials;
•interruptions of key clinical trial or other research activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers, and others;
•limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on our tenants' research, business, or clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people, or as a result of the governmental imposition of shelter-in-place or similar working restrictions;
•interruptions in supply chain, manufacturing, and global shipping, or other delays that may affect the transport of materials necessary for our tenants' research, clinical trials, or manufacturing activities;
•reduction in revenue projections for our tenants' products due to the prioritization of the treatment of covid-19 patients over other treatments, such as specialty and elective procedures and non-covid-19 diagnostics;
•delays in necessary interactions with ethics committees, regulators, and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;
•delays in receiving approval from regulatory authorities to initiate planned clinical trials or research activities;
•delays in commercialization of our tenants' products and approval by governmental authorities (such as the fda and the federal and state emergency management agencies) of our tenants' products caused by disruptions, funding shortages, or health concerns, as well as by the prioritization by the fda of the review and approvals of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines that are related to covid-19;
•difficulty in retaining staff or rehiring staff in connection with layoffs caused by deteriorating global market conditions;
•changes in local regulations as part of a response to the covid-19 outbreak that may require our tenants to change the ways in which their clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs or the discontinuation of the clinical trials altogether;
•refusal or reluctance of the fda to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies outside the u.s.;
•diminishing public trust in healthcare facilities or other facilities, such as medical office buildings, that are treating (or have treated) patients affected by contagious diseases; and
•inability to access capital on terms favorable to our tenants because of changes in company valuation and/or investor appetite due to a general downturn in economic and financial conditions and the volatility of the market.
the negative effects of an outbreak of a contagious disease on our tenants in the technology industry may include, but are not limited to:
•reduction in staff productivity due to business closures, alternative working arrangements, or illness of staff and/or illness in the family;
•reduction in sales of our tenants' services and products, longer sales cycles, reduction in subscription duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies, and increase in price competition due to economic uncertainties and downturns;
•disruptions to our tenants' supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers to deliver products or perform services;
•limitations on business and marketing activities due to travel restrictions and virtualization, or cancellation of customer and employee events;
•adverse impact on customer relationships and our ability to recognize revenues due to our tenants' inability to access their clients' sites for implementation and on-site consulting services;
•inability to recruit and develop highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications, to conduct background checks on potential employees, and to provide necessary equipment and training to new and existing employees;
•network infrastructure and technology system failures of our tenants, or of third-party services used by our tenants, which may result in system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in product development, lengthy interruptions in services, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data;
•higher employment compensation costs that may not be offset by improved productivity or increased sales; and
•inability to access capital on terms favorable to our tenants because of changes in company valuation and/or investor appetite due to a general downturn in of economic and financial conditions and the volatility of the market.
the negative effects of an outbreak of a contagious disease on our tenants in the agtech industry may include, but are not limited to:
•reduction in productive capacity and profitability because of decreased labor availability due, for example, to government restrictions, the inability of employees to report to work, or collective bargaining efforts;
•potential contract cancellations, project reductions, and reduction in demand for our tenants' products due to the adverse effect on business confidence and consumer sentiments and the general downturn in economic conditions;
•disruption of the logistics necessary to import, export, and deliver products to target companies and their customers, as ports and other channels of entry may be closed or may operate at only a portion of capacity;
•disruptions to manufacturing facilities and supply lines; and
•inability to access capital on terms favorable to our tenants because of changes in company valuation and/or investor appetite due to a general downturn in economic and financial conditions and the volatility of the market.
the potential impact of a pandemic or outbreak of a contagious disease with respect to our tenants or our properties is difficult to predict and could have a material adverse impact on our tenants' operations and, in turn, on our revenues, business, and results of operations, as well as the value of our stock. the covid-19 pandemic, or other pandemics, may directly or indirectly cause the realization of any of the other risk factors included in this annual report on form 10-k.
other factors we may incur significant costs if we fail to comply with laws or if laws change.
our properties are subject to many federal, state, and local regulatory requirements and to state and local fire, life-safety, and other requirements. if we do not comply with all of these requirements, we may have to pay fines to government authorities or damage awards to private litigants. we do not know whether these requirements will change or whether new requirements will be imposed. changes in these regulatory requirements could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures. these expenditures could have an adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
for example, the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act, also referred to as proposition 65, requires "clear and reasonable" warnings be given to persons who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. we believe that we comply with proposition 65 requirements; however, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by litigation or regulatory enforcement relating to proposition 65. in addition, there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations will not be significant or will not adversely affect our ability to meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we may incur significant costs in complying with the americans with disabilities act and similar laws.
under the ada, places of public accommodation and/or commercial facilities must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures at our properties to comply with this law. in addition, non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.
a number of additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations exist regarding access by disabled persons. these regulations may require modifications to our properties or may affect future renovations. these expenditures may have an adverse impact on overall returns on our investments.
we face possible risks and costs associated with the effects of climate change and severe weather.
we cannot predict the rate at which climate change will progress. however, the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and business. for example, most of our properties are located along the east and west coasts of the u.s. to the extent that climate change impacts changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience severe weather, including hurricanes, severe winter storms, and coastal flooding due to increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for space at our properties, delays in construction, resulting in increased construction costs, or in our inability to operate the buildings at all. climate change and severe weather may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or decreasing the availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, by increasing the costs of energy, maintenance, repair of water and/or wind damage, and snow removal at our properties.
although congress has not yet enacted comprehensive federal legislation to address climate change, numerous states and municipalities have adopted laws and policies on climate change and emission reduction targets. for example, in july 2019, the climate leadership and community protection act was signed into law in new york, establishing a statewide framework to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. also, in may 2019, new york city enacted the climate mobilization act aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and will apply to commercial and residential buildings. in september 2018, sb 100 was signed into law in california, accelerating the state's renewable portfolio standard target dates and setting a policy of meeting 100% of retail sales from eligible renewables and zero-carbon resources by december 31, 2045. changes in federal, state, and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties (for example, to improve their energy efficiency and/or resistance to severe weather) without a corresponding increase in revenue, which may result in adverse impacts to our net income.
there can be no assurance that climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business.
we may incur significant costs in complying with environmental laws.
federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations may require us, as a current or prior owner or operator of real estate, to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products released at or from any of our properties. the cost of investigating and remediating contamination could be substantial and could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage available to us. in addition, the presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate, may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell an affected property, or to borrow funds using that property as collateral.
under environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay government entities or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by those parties relating to contaminated properties regardless of whether we knew of or caused the contamination. even if more than one party was responsible for the contamination, we may be held responsible for all of the remediation costs. in addition, third parties may sue us for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination, or jointly responsible parties may contest their responsibility or be financially unable to pay their share of such costs.
environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing building materials. these laws may impose fines and penalties on us for the release of asbestos-containing building materials and may allow third parties to seek recovery from us for personal injury from exposure to asbestos fibers. we have detected asbestos-containing building materials at some of our properties, but we do not expect that they will result in material environmental costs or liabilities for us.
environmental laws and regulations also require the removal or upgrading of certain underground storage tanks and regulate:
•the discharge of stormwater, wastewater, and any water pollutants;
•the emission of air pollutants;
•the generation, management, and disposal of hazardous or toxic chemicals, substances, or wastes; and
•workplace health and safety.
many of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties. environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities. environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant's ability to make rental payments to us. we require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us against any related liabilities.
independent environmental consultants have conducted phase i or similar environmental assessments at our properties. we intend to use consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our future acquisitions. this type of assessment generally includes a site inspection, interviews, and a public records review, but no subsurface sampling. these assessments and certain additional investigations of our properties have not to date revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations.
additional investigations have included, as appropriate:
•asbestos surveys;
•radon surveys;
•lead-based paint surveys;
•mold surveys;
•additional public records review;
•subsurface sampling; and
•other testing.
nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our current properties have not revealed, and that assessments on future acquisitions will not reveal, all environmental liabilities. consequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware that may result in substantial costs to us or our tenants and that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
environmental, health, or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements. costs and capital expenditures relating to the evolving requirements depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of new standards. as discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, due to concern over the risks of climate change, a more restrictive regulatory framework to reduce greenhouse gas pollution might be implemented, including the adoption of carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, and increased efficiency standards. these requirements could make our operations more expensive and lengthen our project times. the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements, including greenhouse gas regulations and policies, could negatively impact our financial results. moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. accordingly, environmental, health, or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and the market price of our common stock.
we may be unable to meet our sustainability goals.
we seek to make a positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety, and well-being of our tenants, stockholders, employees, and the communities in which we live and work. in support of these efforts, we set specific sustainability goals to reduce the environmental impact of buildings in operation and for new ground-up construction projects. there are significant risks that may prevent us from achieving these goals, including, but not limited to, the following possibilities:
•change in market conditions may affect our ability to deploy capital for projects that reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gas pollution, and potable water consumption and that provide waste savings.
•our tenants may be unwilling or unable to accept potential incremental expenses associated with our sustainability programs, including expenses to comply with requirements stipulated under building certification standards such as leed, well, and fitwel.
the realization of any of the above risks could significantly impact our reputation, our ability to continue developing properties in markets where high levels of leed certification contribute to our efforts to obtain building permits and entitlements, and our ability to attract tenants who include leed certification among their priorities when selecting a location to lease.
we may invest or spend the net proceeds from the offering of our unsecured senior notes payable due in january 2024 and april 2026 in ways investors may not agree with and in ways that may not earn a profit.
the net proceeds from the offering of our unsecured senior notes payable due in january 2024 and our unsecured senior notes payable due in april 2026 (collectively the "green bonds") will be used to fund, in whole or in part, eligible green projects (as defined below), including the development and redevelopment of such projects. the net proceeds from these offerings were initially used to reduce the outstanding balance on our unsecured senior line of credit. we then allocated the funds to recently completed and future eligible green projects.
there can be no assurance that the projects funded with the proceeds from the green bonds will meet investor criteria and expectations regarding environmental impact and sustainability performance. in particular, no assurance is given that the use of such proceeds for any eligible green projects will satisfy, whether in whole or in part, any present or future investor expectations or requirements regarding any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required to comply, whether by any present or future applicable law or regulations or by its own bylaws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates (in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability, or social impact of any projects or uses, the subject of or related to, the relevant eligible green projects). adverse environmental or social impacts may occur during the design, construction, and operation of the projects, or the projects may become controversial or criticized by activist groups or other stakeholders. in addition, although we will limit the use of proceeds from the green bonds to eligible green projects, there can be no assurance that one or more development, redevelopment, and tenant improvement projects that we expect will receive a leed certification will actually receive such certification. furthermore, from time to time, we may refinance our debt to take advantage of lower market rates or other favorable terms, and we might pursue this strategy in the future in connection with our green bonds. if the terms of the refinanced agreements set different or no restrictions on the range of purposes the funds can be allocated to, we can provide no assurance that allocations to future eligible green projects established prior to the refinancing of our green bonds will remain unchanged after the refinancing has been completed.
''eligible green projects'' are defined as:
•new class a development properties that have received or are expected to receive gold or platinum leed certification;
•existing class a redevelopment properties that have received or are expected to receive gold or platinum leed certification; and
•tenant improvements that have received or are expected to receive gold or platinum leed certification.
eligible green projects include projects with disbursements made in the three years preceding the applicable issue date of the green bonds. we intend to spend the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the green bonds within two years following the applicable issue date of the green bonds. leed is a voluntary, third party building certification process developed by the u.s. green building council (''usgbc''), a non-profit organization. the usgbc developed the leed certification process to (i) evaluate the environmental performance from a whole-building perspective over a building's life cycle, (ii) provide a definitive standard for what constitutes a ''green building,'' (iii) enhance environmental awareness among architects and building contractors, and (iv) encourage the design and construction of energy-efficient, water-conserving buildings that use sustainable or green resources and materials.
changes in u.s. accounting standards may adversely impact us.
the regulatory boards and government agencies that determine financial accounting standards and disclosures in the u.s., which include the fasb and the iasb (collectively, the "boards") and the sec, continually change and update the financial accounting standards we must follow.
from time to time, the boards issue asus that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations, which in turn could also significantly impact the market price of our common stock. such potential impacts include, without limitation, significant changes to our balance sheet, significant changes to the timing or methodology of revenue or expense recognition, or significant fluctuations in our reported results of operations, including an increase in our operating expenses or general and administrative expenses related to payroll costs, legal costs, and other out-of-pocket costs incurred in order to comply with the requirements of these asus.
furthermore, in january 2018, we adopted an asu that amended the accounting for certain equity investments. the core principle of the asu involves the measurement of equity investments at fair value and the recognition of changes in fair value of those investments during each reporting period in net income. since adoption, this asu increased the volatility of our earnings, and is expected to continue introducing volatility to our results of operations, as a result of the guidance requiring us to immediately recognize in net income (i) unrealized gains and losses on our equity investments and (ii) impairments deemed not to be other than temporary under the previous guidance. the increased volatility of our earnings could adversely affect investors' and analysts' ability to form reliable expectations of our future performance, which could negatively impact analysts' "buy," "sell," or "hold" recommendations for our common stock. therefore, our share price could be negatively affected by causes beyond our control.
any difficulties in the implementation of changes in accounting principles, including the ability to modify our accounting systems and to update our policies, procedures, information systems, and internal controls over financial reporting, could result in materially inaccurate financial statements, which in turn could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. significant changes in new asus could cause fluctuations in revenue and expense recognition and materially affect our results of operations. we may also experience an increase in general and administrative expenses resulting from additional resources required for the initial implementation of such asus. this could adversely affect our reported results of operations, profitability, and financial statements. additionally, the adoption of new accounting standards could also affect the calculation of our debt covenants. it cannot be assured that we will be able to work with our lenders to successfully amend our debt covenants in response to changes in accounting standards.
security incidents through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions, or other methods could disrupt our information technology networks and related systems, cause a loss of assets or loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could result in substantial reputational damage and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and the market price of our common stock.
information technology, communication networks, and related systems are essential to the operation of our business. we use these systems to manage our tenant and vendor relationships, internal communications, accounting and record-keeping systems, and many other key aspects of our business. our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks, which also depend on the strength of our procedures and the effectiveness of our internal controls.
a security incident may occur through physical break-ins, breaches of our secure network by an unauthorized party, software vulnerabilities, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, employee theft or misuse, social engineering, or inadequate use of security controls. outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to disclose sensitive information or transfer funds via illegal electronic spamming, phishing, spoofing, or other tactics. additionally, cyber attackers can develop and deploy malware, credential theft or guessing tools, and other malicious software programs to gain access to sensitive data or fraudulently obtain assets we hold.
we have implemented security measures to safeguard our systems and data and to manage cybersecurity risk. we monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure, and invest in the development and enhancement of our controls designed to prevent, detect, respond, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, and other events that could have a security impact. we conduct periodic security awareness trainings of our employees to educate them on how to identify and alert management to phishing emails, spoofed or manipulated electronic communications, and other critical security threats. we have implemented monthly phishing tests using a variety of scenarios, including those obtained from phishing samples and intelligence sources. additionally, we have an internal team and external partners with well-defined processes devoted to responding to threats, including reports of phishing, in real time. we have implemented internal controls around our treasury function, including enhanced payment authorization procedures, verification requirements for new vendor setup and vendor information changes, and bolstered outgoing payment notification process and account reconciliation procedures.
there can be no assurance that our actions, security measures, and controls designed to prevent, detect, or respond to intrusion; to limit access to data; to prevent loss, destruction, alteration, or exfiltration of business information; or to limit the negative impact from such attacks can provide absolute security against a security incident. a significant security incident involving our information systems or those of our tenants, vendors, software creators, cloud providers, cybersecurity service providers, or other third parties with whom we do business could lead to, among other things, the following:
•theft of our cash, cash equivalents, or other liquid assets, including publicly traded securities;
•interruption in the operation of our systems, which may result in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits;
•unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation, or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive, or otherwise valuable information of ours or our tenants, and other business partners, which could be used to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive, or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;
•inability to produce financial and operational data necessary to comply with rules and regulations from the sec, the irs, or other state and federal regulatory agencies;
•our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit;
•significant management attention and resources required to remedy any damages that result;
•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions;
•violation of our lease agreements or other agreements;
•damage to our reputation among our tenants, business partners, and investors;
•loss of business opportunities;
•difficulties in employee retention and recruitment; and
•unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, or denial of service to, the computing systems that manage our buildings.
a principal reason that we cannot provide absolute protection from security incidents is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect, or recognize threats to our systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all security incidents due to, among other things, the frequent change in techniques used in cyber attacks, which may not be recognized until launched, and the wide variety of sources from which a cyber attack can originate. we may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a security incident due to a cyber attack. a successful breach of our computer systems, software, networks, or other technology assets due to a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to, among other things:
•the breadth of our operations and the high volume of transactions that our systems process;
•the large number of our business partners; and
•the proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyber attacks.
the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear. therefore, in the event of an attack, it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. during an investigation, we may not necessarily know the extent of the damage incurred or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.
even if we are not targeted directly, cyber attacks on the u.s. government, financial markets, financial institutions, or other businesses, including our tenants, vendors, software creators, cloud providers, cybersecurity service providers, and other third parties with whom we do business, have occurred in the past and such events could disrupt our normal business operations and networks in the future. in december 2020, hackers reportedly linked to the russian government engaged in a massive cyber attack on the u.s. government and major u.s.-based private companies through malware planted in third-party software. as of the date of this report, the full extent of the hack remains unknown, though a number of governmental agencies and private companies, most of which are u.s.-based, have confirmed breaches.
we maintain insurance to protect ourselves against certain losses incurred in the event of a security incident or disruption of our information systems. however, we cannot be certain that the coverage is adequate to compensate for all damages that may arise. in addition, we cannot be certain that such insurance options will remain available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
general risk factors we face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.
from time to time, we may have significant cash balances that we invested in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. these investments may include (either directly or indirectly) obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks, money market funds, treasury bank securities, and other short-term securities. investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. under certain circumstances, we may be required to redeem all or part of these securities or funds at less than par value. a decline in the value of our investments, or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem them, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay our obligations as they become due.
competition for skilled personnel could increase labor costs.
we compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel. we depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company. competitive pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel. we may not be able to offset such additional costs by increasing the rates we charge tenants. if there is an increase in these costs or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.
from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge agreements to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility. interest rate hedge agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. in addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates. these risk factors may lead to failure to hedge effectively against changes in interest rates and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations. as of december 31, 2020, we had no interest rate hedge agreements outstanding.
market volatility may negatively affect our business.
from time to time, the capital and credit markets experience volatility. in some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial and/or operating strength. if market disruption and volatility occur, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. market disruption and volatility may adversely affect the value of the companies in which we hold equity investments, including through our non-real estate venture investment portfolio, and we may be required to recognize losses in our earnings. disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to capital from financial institutions on favorable terms, or altogether, and our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities could be adversely affected by causes beyond our control through extraordinary disruptions in the global economy and financial systems or through other events.
changes in financial accounting standards may adversely impact our compliance with financial debt covenants.
our unsecured senior notes payable contain financial covenants that are calculated based on gaap at the date the instruments were issued. however, certain debt agreements, including those related to our unsecured senior line of credit, contain financial covenants whose calculations are based on current gaap, which is subject to future changes. our unsecured senior line of credit agreement provides that our financial debt covenants be renegotiated in good faith to preserve the original intent of the existing financial covenant when such covenant is affected by an accounting standard change. for those debt agreements that require the renegotiation of financial covenants upon changes in accounting standards, there is no assurance that we will be successful in such negotiations or that the renegotiated covenants will not be more restrictive to us.
extreme weather and natural or other unforeseen disasters may cause property damage or disrupt operations, which could harm our business and operating results.
we have properties located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural or other disasters, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, winds, floods, hurricanes, fires, power shortages, telecommunication failures, medical epidemics, explosions, or other natural or manmade accidents or incidents. our corporate headquarters and certain properties are located in areas of california that have historically been subject to earthquakes and wildfires. such conditions and disastrous events may damage our properties, disrupt our operations, or adversely impact our tenants' or third-party vendors' operations. these events may affect our ability to operate our business and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating results. damage caused by these events may result in costly repairs for damaged properties or equipment, delays in the development or redevelopment of our construction projects, or interruption of our daily business operations, which may result in increased costs and decreased revenues.
we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business. however, we cannot be certain that the amount of coverage will be adequate to satisfy damages or losses incurred in the event of another wildfire or other natural or manmade disaster, which may lead to a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and our business, or those of our tenants.
failure of the u.s. federal government to manage its fiscal matters or to raise or further suspend the debt ceiling, and changes in the amount of federal debt, may negatively impact the economic environment and adversely impact our results of operations.
the budget control act of 2011 provided for a reduction of $1.1 trillion of u.s. federal government discretionary spending over the succeeding decade (later extended through 2023) through a series of automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. sequestration went into effect on march 1, 2013, and will remain in effect in the absence of further legislative action.
the u.s. federal government has established a limit on the level of federal debt that the u.s. federal government can have outstanding, often referred to as the debt ceiling. the u.s. congress has authority to raise or suspend the debt ceiling and to approve the funding of u.s. federal government operations within the debt ceiling, and has done both frequently in the past, often on a relatively short-term basis. in july 2019, congressional leaders passed a two-year deal to raise the u.s. borrowing limit, which reduced the threat of default and significantly raised federal spending limits. absent appropriate action to mitigate increasing government spending and provide fiscal discipline, the u.s. federal government may encounter similar issues that result in a partial or complete shutdown and/or default of its existing loans as a result of reaching the debt ceiling. if effective legislation to manage the debt ceiling is not enacted and the debt ceiling is reached, the federal government may stop or delay making payments on its obligations. a failure by the u.s. congress to raise the debt limit to the extent necessary in future fiscal years would increase the risk of default by the u.s. on its obligations, the risk of a lowering of the credit rating of the u.s. federal government, and the risk of other economic dislocations. if the u.s. government fails to complete its budget process, another federal government shutdown may result. such a failure, or the perceived risk of such a failure, could consequently have a material adverse effect on the financial markets and economic conditions in the u.s. and throughout the world.
an inability of the u.s. federal government to manage its fiscal matters, reduce the duration and scope of sequestration, or manage its debt may result in the loss of economic confidence domestically and globally, reduce investment spending, increase borrowing costs, impact availability and cost of capital, and significantly hinder or reduce economic activity. furthermore, a failure by the u.s. federal government to enact appropriate fiscal legislation may significantly impact the national and global economic and financial environment and affect our business and the businesses of our tenants. on december 27, 2020, the u.s. federal government was able to enact an appropriations bill for the fiscal year 2021. if, however, the u.s. congress fails to enact a budget for a given fiscal year's government operations, it may result in a government shutdown similar to the one that took place from december 22, 2018, to january 25, 2019. the shutdown affected certain key agencies at the federal government level, including the fda and the sec, and resulted in partial closures of operations. it is unclear whether the u.s. federal government will fail to enact a budget in future fiscal years, and if so, it is possible another partial government shutdown may occur.
the shutdown in early 2019 had affected certain key agencies at the federal government level, including the sec, which closed partial non-essential operations. the sec operated limited functions to address emergency situations involving market integrity and investor protection. however, the sec suspended key functions, such as those related to enforcement actions and review of applications for initial public offerings. future closures of the sec could result in uncertainty regarding regulatory actions, issuance of new or clarifications of existing rules and regulations, disruptions in the initial public offerings of companies, including those of our tenants and companies in which we hold equity investments, and investigations and enforcement actions by the sec. during this period, the fda and certain other science agencies temporarily shut down select non-essential operations. also during this period, the fda maintained only operations deemed to be essential public health-related functions and halted the acceptance of new medical product applications and routine regulatory and compliance work for medical products and certain drugs and foods during the shutdown. the long-term impacts resulting from a prolonged closure of the sec, the fda, and other similar agencies are uncertain and may adversely affect our business operations or our tenants and companies in which we hold equity investments. if economic conditions severely deteriorate as a result of government fiscal gridlock, our operations, or those of our tenants, could be affected, which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. these risks may also impact our overall liquidity, our borrowing costs, or the market price of our common stock.
changes in laws, regulations, and financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations.
as a response, in large part, to perceived abuses and deficiencies in current regulations believed to have caused or exacerbated the recent global financial crisis, legislative, regulatory, and accounting standard-setting bodies around the world are engaged in an intensive, wide-ranging examination and rewriting of the laws, regulations, and accounting standards that have constituted the basic playing field of global and domestic business for several decades. in many jurisdictions, including the u.s., the legislative and regulatory response has included the extensive reorganization of existing regulatory and rule-making agencies and organizations, and the establishment of new agencies with broad powers. this reorganization has disturbed longstanding regulatory and industry relationships and established procedures.
the rule-making and administrative efforts have focused principally on the areas perceived as having contributed to the financial crisis, including banking, investment banking, securities regulation, and real estate finance, with spillover impacts on many other areas. these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry, and many other businesses, that is unprecedented in the u.s. at least since the wave of lawmaking, regulatory reform, and government reorganization that followed the great depression.
the global financial crisis and the aggressive reaction of the government and accounting profession thereto have occurred against a backdrop of increasing globalization and internationalization of financial and securities regulation that began prior to the recent financial crisis. as a result of this ongoing trend, financial and investment activities previously regulated almost exclusively at a local or national level are increasingly being regulated, or at least coordinated, on an international basis, with national rule-making and standard-setting groups relinquishing varying degrees of local and national control to achieve more uniform regulation and reduce the ability of market participants to engage in regulatory arbitrage between jurisdictions. this globalization trend has continued, arguably with an increased sense of urgency and importance, since the financial crisis.
this high degree of regulatory uncertainty, coupled with considerable additional uncertainty regarding the underlying condition and prospects of global, domestic, and local economies, has created a business environment that makes business planning and projections even more uncertain than is ordinarily the case for businesses in the financial and real estate sectors.
in the commercial real estate sector in which we operate, the uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting authorities to fundamentally rewrite major bodies of accounting literature constitute a significant source of uncertainty as to the basic rules of business engagement. changes in accounting standards and requirements, including the potential requirement that u.s. public companies prepare financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of "fair value" measures, may have a significant effect on our financial results and on the results of our tenants, which would in turn have a secondary impact on us. new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of existing pronouncements are likely to continue to occur at an accelerated pace as a result of recent congressional and regulatory actions and continuing efforts by the accounting profession itself to reform and modernize its principles and procedures.
although we have not been as directly affected by the wave of new legislation and regulation as banks and investment banks, we may also be adversely affected by new or amended laws or regulations; by changes in federal, state, or foreign tax laws and regulations; and by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. in the u.s., the financial crisis and continuing economic slowdown prompted a variety of legislative, regulatory, and accounting profession responses.
the federal legislative response culminated in the enactment on july 21, 2010, of the dodd-frank act. the dodd-frank act contains far-reaching provisions that substantially revise, or provide for the revision of, longstanding, fundamental rules governing the banking and investment banking industries and provide for the broad restructuring of the regulatory authorities in these areas. the dodd-frank act has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, profound changes in the ground rules for financial business activities in the u.s. to a large degree, the impacts of the legislative, regulatory, and accounting reforms to date are still not clear.
the ongoing implementation of derivatives regulations could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.
title vii of the dodd-frank act regulates derivatives transactions, which include certain instruments that we use in our risk management activities. it remains impossible at this time to predict the full effects on our hedging activities of the derivatives-related provisions of the dodd-frank act and rules of the commodity futures trading commission ("cftc") and sec thereunder, or the timing of such effects. while the cftc has implemented most of its derivatives-related regulations under the dodd-frank act, it has not yet adopted all of those regulations, and it has proposed revisions to certain of its existing derivatives regulations. the impact of any future new or revised cftc derivatives regulations, or new or revised cftc interpretations of existing regulations, is unknown, but they could result in, among other things, increases in the costs to us of swaps and other derivatives contracts, and decreases in the number and/or creditworthiness of available hedge counterparties. furthermore, at this time, the sec's regulations for security-based swaps have generally not yet been implemented, and their potential impact on our ability to hedge risks cannot yet be known.
in addition, we may enter into hedging transactions with counterparties based in the eu, canada, or other jurisdictions that, like the u.s., are in the process of implementing regulations for derivatives. non-u.s. regulations may apply to such derivatives transactions. the potential impact of such non-u.s. regulations is not fully known and may include, among other things, increased costs for our hedging transactions.
a global financial stress, high structural unemployment levels, and other events or circumstances beyond our control may adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations, contractual commitments, and access to capital.
the covid-19 pandemic that has taken place in 2020 across the u.s. and worldwide has precipitated widespread structural economic and financial stress. in addition, from 2008 through 2010, significant concerns over energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the u.s. mortgage market, and a declining real estate market in the u.s. contributed to increased volatility, diminished expectations for the economy and the markets, and high levels of structural unemployment by historical standards. these factors, combined with volatile oil prices and fluctuating business and consumer confidence, precipitated a steep economic decline. since 2011, the u.s. economy has showed significant signs of improvement, but other economies around the world, including latin america, continue to demonstrate sluggish, stagnant, or slowing growth. further, severe financial and structural strains on the banking and financial systems have led to significant lack of trust and confidence in the global credit and financial system. consumers and money managers have liquidated and may liquidate equity investments, and consumers and banks have held and may hold cash and other lower-risk investments, which has resulted in significant and, in some cases, catastrophic declines in the equity capitalization of companies and failures of financial institutions. although u.s. bank earnings and liquidity have rebounded in recent years, though tapered by the recent covid-19 pandemic, the potential of significant future bank credit losses creates uncertainty for the lending outlook.
further downgrades of the u.s. government's sovereign credit rating and an economic crisis in europe could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition, and earnings.
previous u.s. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns, together with sovereign debt conditions in europe, have increased the possibility of additional downgrades of sovereign credit ratings and economic slowdowns. there is no guarantee that future debt ceiling or federal spending legislation will not fail.
standard & poor's ratings services lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the u.s. from "aaa" to "aa+" in august 2011, which was affirmed in april 2020. although standard & poor's ratings services maintains a stable outlook on the u.s. credit rating, further fiscal impasses within the federal government may result in future downgrades. moody's investor services, inc. affirmed its "aaa" long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings in june 2020 and maintains a stable outlook on the u.s. credit rating but has warned that the u.s. fiscal strength has been deteriorating. fitch ratings inc. maintains a "aaa" sovereign rating for u.s. but shifted its outlook from stable to negative in july 2020 to reflect the ongoing deterioration in the u.s. public finances and the absence of a credible fiscal consolidation plan. the impact of any further downgrades to the u.s. government's sovereign credit rating, or its perceived creditworthiness, is inherently unpredictable and could adversely affect the u.s. and global financial markets and economic conditions.
in addition, certain european nations experienced in the recent past varying degrees of financial stress, including greece, ireland, italy, portugal, and spain. although these economies are continuing to recover or have already gone through a gradual recovery, we do not know whether the economic growth will be slowed by the u.k.'s leaving the eu or whether the prior sovereign financial difficulties within the eu governments will reemerge with a higher degree of negative impact to the financial markets. market concerns over the direct and indirect exposure of european banks and insurers to these eu peripheral nations have resulted in a widening of credit spreads and increased costs of funding for some eu financial institutions. there can be no assurance that government or other measures to aid economic recovery will be effective.
these developments, and concerns over the u.s. government's fiscal policies in general, could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. in addition, the lowered credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which may exert downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
financial volatility and geopolitical instability outside of the u.s. may adversely impact the u.s. and global economies.
in recent years, as global growth has weakened and trade tensions have heightened, the devastating financial and human impacts of covid-19 are mostly yet to be seen. many economies, however, have already experienced financial turmoil, high unemployment, soaring inflation and interest rates, and a significant depreciation of their local currencies. economies of developing countries like venezuela and argentina remain in a long-term crisis, with their current political turmoil exacerbating their economic problems and rendering a bleak near-term outlook. policies of advanced economies have a profound effect on emerging markets, and ramifications of any trade war involving an advanced economy, like of that between the u.s. and china, could further contribute to the adverse economic and political conditions of emerging and other developed economies. in addition, there are ongoing security concerns about north korea and iran's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capabilities, uncertainty regarding north korea and iran's actions, and their relations with the u.s. and the international community in general, which have created a global security issue that may adversely affect international business and economic conditions.
during 2018-2019, disputes on trade policy between the u.s. and china resulted in increased tariffs and escalating tensions between the two countries. on january 15, 2020, the two parties signed a trade deal representing the first phase of trade negotiations between the two countries. the agreement reduced certain existing tariffs, obligated china to purchase additional products from the u.s. in 2020 and 2021, and provided for stronger protection of american intellectual property and trade secrets (the "phase one deal"). the phase one deal has not been dismantled despite china's purchase of products falling behind schedule and escalating tensions and sanctions between the two countries during 2020. newly elected u.s. president biden has stated that there are no immediate plans to cancel the phase one deal, but the administration is expected to make changes to the u.s.-china tariff policies. future trade disputes may result in the imposition of further tariffs or other retaliatory actions that may affect us, the industry in which we operate, or that of our tenants and vendors.
in january 2020, the u.s. imposed new sanctions on iran after tensions escalated in a u.s. airstrike killing a top iranian military leader and iran retaliated with ballistic missile strikes targeted at u.s. bases located in iraq. the sanctions targeted the construction, mining, manufacturing, and textiles sectors, which are key sectors of iran's economy, in an attempt to deny the iranian government revenues derived from these activities. tensions with iran have continued in 2020 under u.s. president trump, and it is not clear what, if anything, newly elected u.s. president biden will do in his administration to ease relations between the two countries. if iran carries out retaliatory actions against the u.s., the u.s. economy, safety, and lives of u.s. residents and businesses may be significantly impacted, resulting in financial volatility and social instability for those affected. this may include, but not be limited to, our company, tenants, employees, investors, and others located in affected communities in which we hold properties.
it is not possible to predict to what extent regional economic and political instability of emerging economies or trade conflicts may negatively impact economies around the world, including the u.s. if these macroeconomic and political issues are not managed appropriately, they could lead to currency devaluation, sovereign debt increases, banking crises, and other financial and political turmoil and uncertainty. continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies.
we have properties and operations in countries where the u.s. dollar is not the local currency, and we thus are subject to international currency risk from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the local currency. in particular, a significant decrease or volatility in the value of the canadian dollar or other currencies in countries where we may have an investment could materially affect our results of operations. we may attempt to mitigate such effects by borrowing in the local foreign currency in which we invest. any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under gross income tests that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit.
adoption of the basel iii standards and other regulatory standards affecting financial institutions may negatively impact our access to financing or affect the terms of our future financing arrangements.
in response to various financial crises and the volatility of financial markets, the basel committee on banking supervision (the "basel committee") adopted the basel iii regulatory capital framework ("basel iii" or the "basel iii standards"). the final package of basel iii reforms was approved by the g20 leaders in november 2010. in january 2013, the basel committee agreed to delay implementation of the basel iii standards and expanded the scope of assets permitted to be included in certain banks' liquidity measurements. u.s. banking regulators have elected to implement substantially all of the basel iii standards, with implementation of basel iii having commenced in 2014 and incrementally implemented through 2020, though progress was limited during 2020 due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.
since approving the basel iii standards, u.s. regulators also issued rules that impose upon the most systemically significant banking organizations in the u.s. supplementary leverage ratio standards (the "slr standards") more stringent than those of the basel iii standards. in addition, the federal reserve board has adopted a final rule that establishes a methodology to identify whether a u.s. bank holding company is a global systemically important banking organization ("gsib"). any firm identified as a gsib would be subject to a risk-based capital surcharge that is calibrated based on its systemic risk profile. under the final rule, the capital surcharge began phasing in on january 1, 2016, and became fully effective on january 1, 2019.
on september 3, 2014, u.s. banking regulators issued a final rule to implement the basel committee's liquidity coverage ratio (the "lcr") in the u.s. (the "lcr final rule"). the lcr is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations to improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from idiosyncratic or market stress, and to improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. the lcr final rule contains requirements that are in certain respects more stringent than the basel committee's lcr. the lcr measures an institution's high-quality liquid assets against its net cash outflows. under the lcr final rule, the lcr transition period occurred from 2015 through 2017.
u.s. regulators have also issued and proposed rules that impose additional restrictions on the business activities of financial institutions, including their trading and investment activities. for example, with effect in april 2014, u.s. regulators adopted a final rule implementing a section of the dodd-frank act that has become known as the "volcker rule." the volcker rule generally restricts certain u.s. and foreign financial institutions from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing in sponsoring or having certain relationships with "covered funds," which include private equity funds and hedge funds. amendments effective in january 2020 have provided a certain level of regulatory relief, particularly pertaining to proprietary trading restrictions, by tailoring the volker rule's application, simplifying certain standards and requirements, and reducing compliance burden. additional amendments related to "covered funds" are expected. the effects of the volcker rule are uncertain, but it is in any event likely to curtail various banking activities, which in turn could result in uncertainties in the financial markets.
the implementation of the basel iii standards, the slr standards, the gsib capital surcharge, the lcr final rule, the volcker rule, and other similar rules and regulations could cause an increase in capital requirements for, and place other financial constraints on, both u.s. and foreign financial institutions from which we borrow, which may negatively impact our access to financing or affect the terms of our future financing arrangements.
changes in the system for establishing u.s. accounting standards may result in adverse fluctuations in our reported asset and liability values and earnings and may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations.
accounting for public companies in the u.s. has historically been conducted in accordance with gaap as established by the fasb, an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for u.s. publicly held companies. the iasb is a london-based independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of ifrs. ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations in other parts of the world.
ifrs differs in material respects from gaap. among other things, ifrs has historically relied more on "fair value" models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap. "fair value" models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities, often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap, which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation.
the sec released a final report on its ifrs work plan, which indicates the sec still needs to analyze and consider whether ifrs should be incorporated into the u.s. financial reporting system. it is unclear at this time how and when the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the decision to incorporate is adopted. in addition, incorporating a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs will be a complex undertaking. we may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs. since these are new endeavors, and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion is uncertain.
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial condition and results of operations. such evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity regarding the specific proposed standards that will be adopted. until there is more certainty with respect to the standards to be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations.
significant developments stemming from recent international trade developments or the u.k.'s referendum on membership in the eu could have a material adverse effect on us.
during his administration, u.s. president trump imposed significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the u.s., particularly from china, mexico, and canada. the u.s., mexico, and canada negotiated and reached an agreement for a new united states-mexico-canada agreement (usmca), which replaced the north american free trade agreement. newly elected u.s. president biden has committed to focus on domestic investment in jobs and education before entering into any new trade deals. any changes in u.s. social, political, regulatory, and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the healthcare system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our tenants operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.
on january 31, 2020, the u.k. officially withdrew from the eu, but a transitional period was extended through december 31, 2020, to allow for businesses and individuals to adjust to its changes, during which all eu regulations continued to apply to the u.k. a trade and cooperation agreement ("tca") was agreed upon by the eu and the u.k. on december 24, 2020, and ratified by the european council and the u.k. parliament ahead of the end of the transition period on december 31, 2020. while the tca has provisions for how both parties will trade, live, and work with one another, financial services are not covered in any detail in the tca. the nature of much of the future economic and political relationship between the eu and u.k. remains uncertain, and there is no guarantee that both parties will be able to adhere to the terms of the deal effectively. the exit of the u.k. from membership of the eu has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the u.k. and the eu, and this uncertainty may last for years. our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the u.k.'s exit from the eu. in addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the u.k. and other countries, including the u.s., and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the u.k. these possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the u.k.'s withdrawal from the eu, may adversely affect our operating results and our tenants' businesses.
social, political, and economic instability, unrest, and other circumstances beyond our control could adversely affect our business operations.
our business may be adversely affected by social, political, and economic instability, unrest, or disruption in a geographic region in which we operate, regardless of cause, including legal, regulatory, and policy changes by a new presidential administration in the u.s., protests, demonstrations, strikes, riots, civil disturbance, disobedience, insurrection, or social and other political unrest.
such events may result in restrictions, curfews, or other actions and give rise to significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles, which may adversely affect our financial condition and operations. in 2020, there were protests in cities throughout the u.s. as well as globally, including in hong kong, in connection with civil rights, liberties, and social and governmental reform. while protests have been peaceful in many locations, looting, vandalism, and fires have occurred in cities such as seattle, portland, los angeles, washington, d.c., new york city, and minneapolis that have led to the imposition of mandatory curfews and, in some locations, deployment of the u.s. national guard. government actions in an effort to protect people and property, including curfews and restrictions on business operations, may disrupt operations, harm perceptions of personal well-being, and increase the need for additional expenditures on security resources. in addition, action resulting from such social or political unrest may pose significant risks to our personnel, facilities, and operations. the effect and duration of demonstrations, protests, or other factors is uncertain, and we cannot ensure there will not be further political or social unrest in the future or that there will not be other events that could lead to social, political, and economic disruptions. if such events or disruptions persist for a prolonged period of time, our overall business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
in addition, a new u.s. president, joseph r. biden, was elected in november 2020. on january 6, 2021, a group of supporters of president trump, some of whom were armed and violent, illegally stormed and vandalized the u.s. capitol as a response to false claims of widespread voter fraud and encouragement from u.s. president trump to protest the congressional certification of the u.s. presidential election results. several people were killed in the incursion. following the deadly event at the capitol, on january 13, 2021, the house of representatives voted to impeach u.s. president trump for incitement of insurrection. on january
20, 2021, the presidential inauguration of president biden was carried out with increased security measures but without further major incident. the aftermath of the november 2020 presidential election, including the january 6, 2021, violent disruption at the capitol, has left the u.s. in what many consider to be an extremely heightened state of political and social tension, and it is unclear whether this tension will dissipate or intensify in coming months and what resulting impacts may occur to adversely affect our business operations or the safety of our employees, our tenants, and the communities in which we operate.
changes in federal policy, including tax policies, and at regulatory agencies occur over time through policy and personnel changes following elections, which lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on certain industries and corporate entities. the nature, timing, and economic and political effects of potential changes to the current legal and regulatory frameworks affecting the life science, technology, and agtech industries, as well as the real estate industry in general, remain highly uncertain. for example, any proposals to make changes related to u.s. tax law, such as those involving section 1031 exchanges, may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. from time to time, we dispose of properties in transactions qualified as section 1031 exchanges. if certain proposed changes were ultimately effected and the laws surrounding section 1031 exchanges amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax-deferred basis. in such a case, our earnings and profits and our taxable income would increase, which could increase dividend income and reduce the return of capital to our stockholders. as a result, we may be required to pay additional dividends to stockholders, or if we do not pay additional dividends, our corporate income tax liability could increase and we may be subject to interest and penalties.
terrorist attacks may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets.
terrorist attacks such as those that took place on september 11, 2001, could have a material adverse impact on our business, our operating results, and the market price of our common stock. future foreign or domestic terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for, and the value of, our properties. to the extent that any future foreign or domestic terrorist attacks impact our tenants, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their lease obligations.
our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures.
despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures, and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunications failures. any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. we may also incur additional significant costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.
any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, or the market price of our common stock. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we presently deem to be immaterial, may also have potential to materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

the covid-19 pandemic in december 2019, a novel coronavirus, which causes respiratory illness and spreads from person to person (covid-19), was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in wuhan, china. the first case of covid-19 in the u.s. was reported on january 20, 2020. on march 11, 2020, the world health organization declared covid-19 a pandemic, and on march 13, 2020, the u.s. declared a national emergency with respect to covid-19. as of january 29, 2021, according to the world health organization, over 101.0 million novel coronavirus cases have been reported worldwide. the u.s. has reported more than 25.3 million cases of covid-19 and over 425,670 deaths as of january 29, 2021.
covid-19 disease, treatment, and measures to combat the pandemic most patients with covid-19 have had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and loss of taste. many individuals with covid-19 are asymptomatic and show limited to no symptoms, highlighting the ongoing challenge of containing the continued spread of covid-19. some patients develop pneumonia in both lungs and/or multi-organ failure, which in some cases leads to death. since scientists shared the virus's genetic makeup in january 2020, intense research has been underway around the world to develop treatments and vaccines for covid-19. this has led to the fda issuing emergency use authorizations ("eua"s) for therapeutics to treat patients with covid-19 and, most recently, approving two vaccines for use in the prevention of coronavirus disease caused by covid-19.
the two approved vaccines were created by pfizer inc. (in partnership with biontech) and moderna, inc. (in partnership with the national institutes of health), each a tenant of ours. the u.s. began a large-scale covid-19 vaccination campaign in december 2020. as of january 29, 2021, according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, over 4.7 million individuals in the u.s. have been fully vaccinated for covid-19, and the u.s. will continue to roll out vaccines across the nation, prioritizing frontline and essential workers, the elderly, and individuals considered high risk.
although the u.s. fda has approved two vaccines and certain therapies for use as of the date of this report, the initial rollout of vaccine distribution has encountered significant delays, and uncertainties remain as to the amount of vaccine available for distribution, the logistics of implementing a national vaccine program, and the overall efficacy of the vaccines once widely administered, especially as new strains of covid-19 have been discovered, and the level of resistance these new strains have to the existing vaccines, if any, remains unknown.
in response to the supply and distribution issues surrounding the vaccine, in january 2021, president biden outlined a plan to create additional vaccination sites, increase the supply and distribution of vaccines, and increase the number of vaccinations administered to americans. the biden administration plans to utilize the defense production act to maximize the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines in order to administer 100 million vaccination shots within the first 100 days of holding office.
in addition to the currently approved vaccines, as of january 29, 2021, there are over 60 other potential vaccines in clinical development that may contribute to increasing the supply of vaccines in 2021. the current vaccines in development use a myriad of different scientific approaches to attempt to provoke an immune response, including:
•genetic vaccines that use part of the coronavirus's genetic code;
•viral vector vaccines that use a virus to deliver coronavirus genes into cells;
•protein-based vaccines that use a coronavirus protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system; and
•whole-virus vaccines that use a weakened or inactivated version of the coronavirus.
over 60 potential vaccines are currently in human clinical trials, with nearly a third of these in later stages of clinical development. phase i trials typically include a small number of participants to test safety and dosage as well as to confirm that the vaccine stimulates the immune system. phase ii trials involve hundreds of participants split into groups, such as children and the elderly, to determine whether the vaccine acts differently in each subpopulation. phase iii trials involve delivering the vaccine to tens of thousands of people, observing how many subsequently become infected, and determining the severity of symptoms when compared with volunteer subjects who received a placebo. regulators in each country will review the trial results to make a determination as to whether the drug or vaccine should be approved. as of january 29, 2021, there were 20 potential vaccines in phase iii trials, including a number that require only a single dose, rather than two doses for the currently approved vaccines and that are potentially easier to distribute.
shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders on march 19, 2020, california became the first state to set mandatory stay-at-home restrictions to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. the order included the shutdown of all nonessential services, such as dine-in restaurants, bars, gyms, conference or convention centers, and other businesses not deemed to support critical infrastructure. exceptions for essential services, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, food banks, convenience stores, and delivery restaurants, have allowed these services to remain open. subsequently, almost all states issued similar orders, including new york, massachusetts, washington, maryland, and north carolina, where our remaining properties outside california are located. countries around the world also implemented measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, from national quarantines to school closures or similar types of stay-at-home orders or movement limitations.
most state orders expired or were rescinded between may and early june 2020, and authorities began reopening businesses, including retail stores, restaurants, bars, salons, houses of worship, entertainment venues such as movie theaters and museums, and manufacturing facilities and offices. daily new covid-19 cases in the u.s., which had declined to approximately 18,000 new daily cases by june 9, 2020, from the low- to mid-30,000 daily range in april 2020, began to surge, leading to additional restrictions in many parts of the country. additionally, in recent months, new covid-19 variants were discovered in the u.k, among other countries, which have spread globally, including the u.s. while these strains do not appear to cause more severe symptoms in individuals, they have shown to be more infectious than the original strain discovered in china. as a result, more stringent lockdown restrictions have been implemented globally and within the u.s. on january 29, 2021, according to the world health organization, 155,203 new cases and 4,100 deaths were reported in the u.s.
impact to the global and u.s. economy as a result of the unprecedented measures taken in the u.s. and around the world, the disruption and impact to the u.s. and global economies and financial markets by the covid-19 pandemic have been significant. in january 2021, the imf estimated that the global and u.s. economies contracted by 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively, during 2020, in contrast to the expansion of 3.3% and 2.0%, respectively, that imf projected for the year 2020 in january 2020. however, multiple vaccine approvals have raised hopes for an eventual end to the pandemic, and the rollout of vaccines has contributed to the positive global and u.s. growth projections for 2021, as estimated by imf in january 2021, of 5.5% and 5.1%, respectively. these projections may be negatively impacted by potential new strains of the virus, renewed lockdowns, or logistical problems with vaccine distribution.
based on the data provided by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics on january 8, 2021, the unemployment rate in the u.s. is up by 3.2% since february 2020 to 6.7%. the december 2020 data reported 140 thousand jobs lost in december 2020. stock markets around the globe have rebounded substantially since march 2020; however, since the pandemic was declared, access to capital has become much more challenging for most companies or non-existent for some.
the unprecedented disruption and impact to the u.s. and global economies and financial markets from the covid-19 pandemic resulted in the u.s. president trump's signing into law on march 27, 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act ("cares act"), a $2 trillion economic stimulus package. the cares act allocated over $140 billion to the u.s. health system to support covid-19-related manufacturing, production, diagnostics, and treatments, and to accelerate the market entrance of necessary vaccines and cures. the cares act also designated $945.4 million specifically to the nih, a tenant of ours in our maryland market, to combat covid-19, which includes, but is not limited to, providing support for research, construction, and acquisition of equipment for vaccine and infectious disease research facilities, including the acquisition of real property.
in addition, on april 24, 2020, the president trump signed the paycheck protection program and health care enhancement act into law, which provided an additional $484 billion of relief primarily to assist distressed small businesses and prevent them from shutting their operations and laying off employees. this package designated $75 billion to hospitals and $25 billion for a new covid-19 testing program. it is too early to determine if the cares act and the $484 billion relief package were effective or sufficient to offset some of the most severe economic effects of the pandemic.
on august 8, 2020, president trump signed four executive actions to provide additional covid-19 relief along with unemployment benefits of $400 weekly payment to those receiving more than $100 a week in state-funded unemployment benefits through december 6, 2020. on december 27, 2020, a second stimulus package was passed to provide relief aid to americans during financial hardship, aggregating $900 billion in provisions, which included an additional $600 payment to eligible american adults and $600 for qualifying child dependents, a reinstatement of unemployment benefits of $300 per week through march 14, 2021, an additional $285 billion towards loan programs for small businesses, $82 billion towards education, and additional aid for hard-hit industries, including the airline industry.
on january 14, 2020, then president-elect biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion "american rescue plan" proposal to combat the pandemic and stimulate the economy. the proposal provides additional provisions for increased unemployment benefits, rental assistance, small businesses, state and local governments, educational institutions, and substantial funding towards accelerated distribution of vaccinations and for covid-19 testing, as well as direct payments of $1,400 to all eligible americans. the american rescue plan is the first of two major spending initiatives expected to be proposed by president biden in the coming weeks.
potential ineffectiveness or delay of such relief measures could lead to further deterioration of economic conditions, higher unemployment rates, and prolonged recession, which in turn could materially affect our (or our tenants' or venture investment portfolio companies') performance, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. see "item 1a. risk factors" within "part i" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional discussion of the risks posed by the covid-19 pandemic, and uncertainties we, our tenants, and the national and global economies face as a result.

key capital events in 2020
unsecured senior line of credit
•on october 6, 2020, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit. key changes include the following:
new agreement           change commitments available for borrowing       $3.0 billion            up $800 million interest rate                             libor+0.825%            added a 0% libor floor maturity date                             january 6, 2026         extended 2 years
•in april 2020, we closed an additional unsecured senior line of credit with $750.0 million of available commitments, which had a maturity date of april 14, 2022, and bore interest at libor plus 1.05%. in addition to the cost of borrowing, this line of credit was subject to an annual facility fee of 0.20% based on the aggregate commitment outstanding. the terms of the $750.0 million unsecured senior line of credit agreement required that the outstanding commitments be reduced by 100% of net cash proceeds from certain new debt transactions and 50% of net cash proceeds from new equity offerings as defined in the agreement. in august 2020, we received cash proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 1.875% unsecured senior notes, and, pursuant to the terms of the $750.0 million unsecured senior line of credit agreement, all outstanding commitments from the line of credit were reduced to zero, and we terminated this facility.
commercial paper program
•during 2020, we increased the aggregate amount we may issue under our commercial paper program from $750.0 million to $1.5 billion as of december 31, 2020. borrowings under our commercial paper program are backed by our $3.0 billion unsecured senior line of credit.
unsecured senior notes payable
•in march 2020, we completed an offering of $700.0 million of unsecured senior notes payable due on december 15, 2030, at an interest rate of 4.90% for net proceeds of $691.6 million.
•in august 2020, we opportunistically issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes payable due in 2033 at an interest rate of 1.875% ("1.875% unsecured senior notes").
•we used a portion of the proceeds from our 1.875% unsecured senior notes to refinance $500.0 million of our 3.90% unsecured senior notes payable due in 2023, pursuant to a partial cash tender offer completed on august 5, 2020, and a subsequent call for redemption for the remaining outstanding amounts, which settled on september 4, 2020. as a result of our debt refinancing, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50.8 million, including the write-off of unamortized loan fees extinguishment of unsecured senior notes payable, unsecured senior line of credit, and secured notes payable
•in august 2020, we refinanced our 3.90% unsecured senior notes payable due in 2023 aggregating $500.0 million and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $50.8 million, including the write-off of unamortized loan fees. additionally, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $1.9 million due to the termination of our $750.0 million unsecured senior line of credit.
•in december 2020, we extinguished two secured notes payable aggregating $108.2 million, due in 2023 with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.67%, and recognized losses on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $7.3 million. as a result of these extinguishments, we have no debt maturing until 2024.
forward equity sales agreements
•in january 2020 and july 2020, we entered into forward equity sales agreements aggregating $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, to sell an aggregate of 6.9 million shares for each offering (13.8 million in aggregate) of our common stock, including the exercise of underwriters' options, at public offering prices of $155.00 per share and $160.50 per share, respectively, before underwriting discounts. during 2020, we issued all 13.8 million shares under these forward equity sales agreements and received net proceeds of $2.1 billion.
•in january 2021, we entered into forward equity sales agreements aggregating $1.1 billion to sell an aggregate of 6.9 million shares of our common stock (including the exercise of underwriters' option) at a public offering price of $164.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions. we expect to settle these forward equity sales agreements in march 2021.
atm common stock offering program
•in february 2020, we entered into a new atm common stock offering program, which allows us to sell up to an aggregate of $850.0 million of our common stock.
•we issued 1.5 million shares of common stock under our atm program at a price of $159.09 per share (before underwriting discounts), and received net proceeds of $235.0 million in 2020.
•we have 362 thousand shares under our atm program subject to forward equity sales agreements that remain outstanding at a price of $159.09 per share (before underwriting discounts) as of december 31, 2020. we expect to settle these forward equity sales agreements in 2021 and receive net proceeds of approximately $56.3 million.
•the remaining availability of $547.3 million under this atm program expired in december 2020 concurrently with the expiration of the associated shelf registration. in january 2021, we filed a new shelf registration and we expect to establish a new atm program soon in 2021.
unconsolidated real estate joint venture loan
•in march 2020, our unconsolidated joint venture at 1655 and 1725 third street, in which we own a 10% interest, located in mission bay/soma, refinanced an existing variable-rate secured construction loan with a fixed-rate loan with terms as follows:
100% at joint venture level         amended agreement       change aggregate commitments               $600.0 million          increase of $225.0 million maturity date                       march 2025              extended by 45 months interest rate                       fixed at 4.50%          previously libor + 3.70%
investments
•our investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities aggregated a carrying amount of $1.6 billion, including an adjusted cost basis of $835.4 million and unrealized gains of $775.7 million, as of december 31, 2020.
•investment income of $421.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2020, consisted of $47.3 million of realized gains, which included $24.5 million of impairments related to investments in privately held entities that do not report nav, and $374.0 million of unrealized gains.
2021 capital strategy during 2021, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to achieve further improvements to our credit profile, which will allow us to further improve our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. for further information, refer to the "projected results" section below under this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k. consistent with 2020, our capital strategy for 2021 includes the following elements:
•allocate capital to class a properties located in collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in aaa urban innovation clusters;
•continue to improve our credit profile;
•maintain prudent access to diverse sources of capital, which include cash flows from operating activities after dividends, incremental debt supported by our growth in ebitda, real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, joint venture capital, and other capital such as sales of equity;
•maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•prudently ladder debt maturities;
•reduce short-term variable-rate debt;
•prudently manage equity investments to support corporate-level investment strategies;
•maintain significant balance sheet liquidity; and
•maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet.
given the anticipated delivery of significant incremental ebitda from our development and redevelopment of new class a properties, we expect to be able to debt fund a significant portion of construction on a leverage-neutral basis. we expect to continue to maintain access to a diverse source of debt, including unsecured senior notes payable, as well as secured construction loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of our net operating income on an unencumbered basis to allow for future flexibility for accessing both unsecured and secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of our capital structure. in addition to debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis, we intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities, after dividends and proceeds from real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, partial interest sales, and other debt and equity capital.
improved cost of capital as part of our capital strategy to continue strengthening our credit profile, we expect to complete and place into service development and redevelopment projects currently under construction, which we expect will deliver significant incremental ebitda. the expected growth in our ebitda in 2021 and beyond should allow us to obtain debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis and provide significant capital to fund our development and redevelopment projects. additionally, the resulting expected improvement in our balance sheet leverage ratio should allow us to access diverse sources of capital, strengthen our credit profile, and reduce our cost of capital. in addition, we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of unencumbered net operating income. for the year ended december 31, 2020, our unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income was 96%.
investments we present our equity investments at fair value whenever fair value or nav is readily available. adjustments for our limited partnership investments represent changes in reported nav as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. for investments without readily available fair values, we adjust the carrying amount whenever such investments have an observable price change, and further adjustments are not made until another price change, if any, is observed. refer to note 7 - "investments" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.

alexandria and our innovative tenants are at the vanguard and heart of the life science ecosystem advancing solutions for covid-19
safe and effective vaccines and therapies, in addition to widespread testing, continue to be critically needed to combat the global covid-19 pandemic. by maintaining essential continuous operations across our campuses, alexandria has enabled several of our life science tenants to pursue mission-critical covid-19-related research and development. the heroic work being done by so many of our tenants and campus community members to help test for, treat, and prevent covid-19, as well as provide medical supplies and protective equipment to neighboring hospitals, is profound and inspiring. we are currently tracking approximately 100 tenants across our cluster markets that have contributed meaningful time and resources to advancing solutions for covid-19.

•a prophylactic vaccine is critically needed to resolve the global covid-19 pandemic. as such, researchers around the world are working tirelessly to develop a safe and effective vaccine in record time. furthermore to help expedite the development, manufacturing, and distribution of covid-19 vaccines, the u.s. government initiated an unprecedented public-private collaboration, allocating several billions of dollars to these efforts.
•this support along with the internal vaccine development expertise and innovative technology platforms of our tenants pfizer inc. (in partnership with biontech) and moderna, inc. (in partnership with the national institutes of health), culminated in the fda providing emergency use authorization ("eua") in december 2020 for their respective mrna based covid-19 vaccines. the u.s. has begun a large-scale covid-19 vaccination campaign and will continue to roll out vaccines across the nation, prioritizing frontline and essential workers, the elderly, and individuals considered high-risk.
•additional tenants, including astrazeneca plc, emergent biosolutions inc., fujifilm diosynth biotechnologies, glaxosmithkline, johnson & johnson, novavax, inc., and sanofi, have similarly received strong government support for their efforts in the development, manufacturing, and/or distribution of covid-19 vaccines. many of these companies will report critical trial data over the coming months, which, if positive, could help bolster the widespread delivery of a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine around the world.
advancing new and repurposed therapies
•safe and effective therapies are important for mitigating the impact of covid-19, decreasing hospitalizations, and improving patient outcomes overall. on october 22, 2020, the fda approved veklury® (remdesivir), developed by our tenant gilead sciences, inc., as the first antiviral treatment approved for covid-19 patients requiring hospitalization. subsequently, in november 2020, the fda granted euas to tenant eli lilly and company's bamlanivimab for the treatment of newly infected high-risk patients with mild or moderate disease, as well as to regeneron pharmaceutical's antibody cocktail for a similar indication.
•in addition, over 300 experimental therapies to treat covid-19 are being studied in over 900 clinical trials around the world, as well as over more than 150 therapeutic candidates in preclinical development. a substantial number of these programs are sponsored by our tenants, including the following:
•vir biotechnology, inc. and glaxosmithkline announced on october 6, 2020, that their most advanced antibody therapy for the early treatment of patients with covid-19 has entered phase iii and that they expect complete results in the first quarter of 2021.
•abbvie inc., amgen, astrazeneca plc, atreca inc., enanta pharmaceuticals, inc., novartis ag, and pfizer inc. are similarly endeavoring to develop novel therapies and repurpose existing and investigational drugs to provide near-term treatments for moderate and severe covid-19 patients and those at highest risk.
improving testing quality and capacity
•abbott laboratories, adaptive biotechnologies corporation, color, cue health inc., laboratory corporation of america holdings, quest diagnostics, quidel corporation, roche, thermo fisher scientific inc., verily life sciences, and others are working to improve testing quality, capacity, and turnaround time to more effectively determine who has an active covid-19 infection, who has been exposed to the virus, and who has developed immunity against it. the increased availability of widespread covid-19 testing is critical for curtailing the pandemic and facilitating a safer reopening of workplaces, communities, and society overall.

(1)includes a termination fee recognized during the three months ended september 30, 2020. refer to "income from rentals" in note 5 - "leases" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for detail.
income from rentals total income from rentals for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $361.3 million, or 23.8%, to $1.9 billion, compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, as a result of increases in rental revenues and tenant recoveries, as discussed below.
rental revenues total rental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $306.1 million, or 26.3%, to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues from our non-same properties aggregating $292.7 million primarily related to 1,008,382 rsf of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2019, and 84 operating properties aggregating 7.8 million rsf acquired subsequent to january 1, 2019, as well as a termination fee of $89.5 million recognized in connection with the termination of our contract for a future lease at our development project at 88 bluxome street in our soma submarket during the three months ended september 30, 2020. our annual rental revenue per rsf was $49.08 as of december 31, 2020 compared to $51.04 as of december 31, 2019. the decrease in our rental revenue per rsf was due to our recent acquisitions of alexandria center® for life science - durham in our research triangle submarket, and acquisitions made during the three months ended december 31, 2020, including 6420 and 6450 sequence drive in our sorrento mesa submarket of san diego, and 380 and 420 e street in our seaport innovation district submarket of greater boston. annual rental rates per rsf in our research triangle and seattle markets, in which most of the operating rsf of the aforementioned acquisitions is concentrated, is generally lower than annual rental rates per rsf in our greater boston and san francisco markets where the majority of our operating rsf is located. excluding these acquisitions, our annual rental revenue per rsf as of december 31, 2020, would have been $51.26. for the definition of "annual rental revenue" refer to the "non-gaap measures and definitions" section under item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k.
rental revenues from our same properties for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $13.4 million, or 1.3%, to $1.03 billion, compared to $1.02 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to rental rate increases on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since january 1, 2019. refer to the "leasing activity" section of "item 2. properties" within "part i" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional details. the increase was partially offset by the effect of reduced revenues generated from our transient parking, retail tenants, and amenities, which had limited operations due to covid-19 restrictions.
the increase in total rental revenues was also partially offset by a $5.4 million reduction to rental revenues recognized during the year ended december 31, 2020, due to specific write-offs and a general allowance related to deferred rent balances of tenants that are or may potentially be impacted by uncertainties surrounding covid-19.
tenant recoveries tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $55.3 million, or 15.7%, to $406.4 million, compared to $351.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. this increase is consistent with the increase in our rental operating expenses of $84.7 million, or 19.0%, as discussed under "rental operations" below.
same properties' tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $14.1 million, or 4.5%, to $327.8 million, compared to $313.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily due to the increase in property tax expenses resulting from higher assessed values of our properties, higher property insurance, and higher repairs and maintenance expenses during the year ended december 31, 2020, as discussed under "rental operations" below. as of december 31, 2020, 94% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.
other income other income for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, was $7.4 million and $14.4 million, respectively, primarily consisting of construction management fees and interest income earned during each respective period. the decrease was primarily a result of lower construction management fees recognized due to the completion of certain projects.
rental operations total rental operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $84.7 million, or 19.0%, to $530.2 million, compared to $445.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to incremental expenses from our non-same properties, primarily related to 1,008,382 rsf of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2019, and 84 operating properties aggregating 7.8 million rsf acquired subsequent to january 1, 2019.
same properties' rental operating expenses increased by $2.5 million, or 0.7%, to $373.4 million, compared to $370.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to an increase in property tax expenses resulting from higher assessed values of our properties, higher property insurance, and higher repairs and maintenance expenses, which were partially offset by reduced operating expenses related to retail tenants and amenities, which had no or limited operations due to covid-19 restrictions during the year ended december 31, 2020.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $24.5 million, or 22.5%, to $133.3 million, compared to $108.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. approximately $4.5 million of the increase was the result of the acceleration of stock compensation expense recognized in connection with the resignation of an executive officer during the three months ended september 2020. this former executive officer remains a consultant to the company. a portion of unvested stock outstanding will continue to vest pursuant to the original terms of the awards. this was deemed a modification for accounting purposes due to a significant reduction in future services to the company, which resulted in an accelerated vesting and recognition of the fair value of the modified award. the remaining increase was primarily due to continued growth in the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including development and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired subsequent to january 1, 2019, as discussed under "income from rentals" above. as a percentage of net operating income, our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, were 9.8% and 10.0%, respectively.

we expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, distributions to noncontrolling interests, and payment of dividends through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic real estate joint venture capital, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, issuances under our commercial paper program, and issuances of additional debt and/or equity securities.
we expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a reit.
over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows:
•retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for investment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions;
•improve credit profile and relative long-term cost of capital;
•maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective real estate asset sales, partial interest sales, non-real estate investment sales, preferred stock, and common stock;
•maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•maintain prudent laddering of debt maturities;
•maintain solid credit metrics;
•maintain significant balance sheet liquidity;
•mitigate variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate bank debt;
•maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility;
•fund common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests from net cash provided by operating activities;
•manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate; and
•maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects.

operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectibility of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of development and redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions and dispositions of operating properties. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased to $882.5 million, compared to $683.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. this increase was primarily attributable to (i) cash flows generated from our highly leased development and redevelopment projects recently placed into service, (ii) income-producing acquisitions since january 1, 2019, and (iii) increases in rental rates on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since january 1, 2019.

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020, was primarily due to an increased source of cash from proceeds from sales of real estate, partially offset by cash used in purchases of real estate and additions to real estate. refer to note 3 - "investments in real estate" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for further information.

inflation as of december 31, 2020, approximately 94% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. approximately 94% of our leases (on an rsf basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. a period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured senior line of credit and secured construction loans held by our unconsolidated joint ventures.
capital resources we expect that our principal liquidity needs for the year ending december 31, 2021, will be satisfied by the following multiple sources of capital, as shown in the table below. there can be no assurance that our sources and uses of capital will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations.

(1)in december 2020, three office buildings aggregating 146,842 rsf met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. we expect to complete the sale of these properties in 2021 for a total estimated sales price of $78.1 million, including the buyer's assumption of a $28.2 million secured note payable related to one of the buildings. upon the buildings being classified as held for sale, we recognized impairment charges aggregating $25.2 million.
(2)represents forward equity sales agreements that we expect to settle in 2021 and receive net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion.
(3)in addition to our guidance range, we may seek opportunities to refinance our $650 million unsecured senior notes payable green bond due in 2024 prior to its maturity, subject to market conditions.
the key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above include a favorable capital market environment, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed as "forward-looking statements" under "part 1"; "item 1a. risk factors" and "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k. we expect to update our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.
sources of capital net cash provided by operating activities after dividends we expect to retain $210.0 million to $250.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the year ending december 31, 2021. for purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. we also excluded significant contract termination fees that represent an ancillary source of cash that is not associated with any ongoing activity at any of our operating properties. for the year ending december 31, 2021, we expect our recently delivered projects, our highly pre-leased value-creation projects expected to be completed and along with contributions from same properties and recently acquired properties, to contribute significant increases in income from rentals, net operating income, and cash flows. we anticipate significant contractual near-term growth in annual cash rents of $28 million related to the commencement of contractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent period. refer to the "cash flows" section within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2020.
debt as of december 31, 2020, we have no outstanding balance on our unsecured senior line of credit. our unsecured senior line of credit bears an interest rate of libor plus 0.825%. in addition to the cost of borrowing, the unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.15% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding. on october 6, 2020, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit to increase commitments available for borrowing by $800 million to an aggregate of $3.0 billion and to extend the maturity date to january 6, 2026. among other things, the amended credit agreement includes a 0% libor floor on the interest rate and is subject to certain annual sustainability measures entitling us to a temporary reduction in the interest rate margin of one basis point, but not below zero percent per year.
we use our unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit bear interest at a "eurocurrency rate," a "libor floating rate," or a "base rate" specified in the unsecured senior line of credit agreement plus, in any case, the applicable margin. the eurocurrency rate specified in the unsecured senior line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to either (i) the libor or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the company for loans denominated in a libor quoted currency (i.e., u.s. dollars, euro, sterling, or yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to canadian dollar bankers' acceptances for loans denominated in canadian dollars, (iii) the bank bill swap reference bid rate for loans denominated in australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-libor quoted currency (other than canadian or australian dollars). the libor floating rate means, for any day, one-month libor, or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the company for loans denominated in u.s. dollars. the base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the administrative agent as its "prime rate," and (iii) the eurocurrency rate plus 1.00%. our unsecured senior line of credit contains a feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. this may result in an interest rate that is below the stated rate.
we expect to fund a portion of our capital needs in 2021 from the settlement of our outstanding forward equity sales agreements, from sales of our common stock under our atm program, from issuances under our commercial paper program discussed below, from borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, and from real estate dispositions and partial interest sales.
we established a commercial paper program that provides us with the ability to issue up to $1.5 billion of commercial paper notes generally with a maturity of 30 days or less and with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. our commercial paper program is backed by our unsecured senior line of credit, and at all times we expect to retain a minimum undrawn amount of borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit equal to any outstanding balance on our commercial paper program. we use borrowings under the program to fund short-term capital needs. the notes issued under our commercial paper program are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market. they are typically issued at a discount to par, representing a yield to maturity dictated by market conditions at the time of issuance. in the event we are unable to issue commercial paper notes or refinance outstanding commercial paper notes under terms equal to or more favorable than those under the unsecured senior line of credit, we expect to borrow under the unsecured senior line of credit at libor plus 0.825%. the commercial paper notes sold during the year ended december 31, 2020, were issued at a weighted-average yield to maturity of 0.26%. as of december 31, 2020, we had $100.0 million of outstanding notes under our commercial paper program.
in march 2020, we completed an offering of $700.0 million of unsecured senior notes payable due on december 15, 2030, at an interest rate of 4.90% for net proceeds of $691.6 million. the net proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program.
in august 2020, we completed an offering of $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes payable due on february 1, 2033, at an interest rate of 1.875% for net proceeds of $989.1 million. a portion of the proceeds was used to refinance our 3.90% unsecured senior notes payable due in 2023, aggregating $500.0 million, pursuant to a partial cash tender offer and a subsequent call for redemption. on august 5, 2020, we tendered $247.0 million, or 49.4%, of our outstanding 3.90% unsecured senior notes payable and settled the call for redemption of the remaining outstanding balance on september 4, 2020. as a result of our debt refinancing, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50.8 million, including the write-off of unamortized loan fees.
in december 2020, we extinguished two secured notes payable aggregating $108.2 million due in 2023 with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.67% and recognized losses on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $7.3 million. as a result of these extinguishments, we have no debt maturing until 2024.
since january 1, 2019, we have completed the issuances of $4.4 billion in unsecured senior notes, with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.48% and a weighted-average maturity of 14.1 years, as of december 31, 2020.

proactive management of transition away from libor libor has been used extensively in the u.s. and globally as a reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts, including variable-rate debt and interest rate swap contracts. however, it is expected that libor will no longer be used after june 30, 2023. to address the increased risk of libor discontinuation, in the u.s. the alternative reference rates committee ("arrc") was established to help ensure the successful transition from libor. in june 2017, the arrc selected sofr, a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by u.s. treasury securities, as its preferred replacement for u.s. dollar libor. we have been closely monitoring developments related to the transition away from libor and have implemented numerous proactive measures to minimize the potential impact of the transition to the company, specifically:
•we have proactively eliminated outstanding libor-based borrowings under our unsecured senior bank term loans and secured construction loans through repayments. from january 2017 through december 2020, we retired approximately $1.5 billion of such debt.
•during 2020, we increased the aggregate amount of our commercial paper program to $1.5 billion from $750.0 million. this program provides us with ability to issue commercial paper notes bearing interest at short-term fixed rates, generally with a maturity of 30 days or less and with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. our commercial paper program is not subject to libor and is used for funding short-term working capital needs. as of december 31, 2020, we had $100.0 million of outstanding notes under our commercial paper program.
•we continue to prudently manage outstanding borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, our only libor-based debt (excluding $12.7 million libor-based debt held by one of our unconsolidated joint ventures as of december 31, 2020). as of december 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit.
•our unsecured senior line of credit contains fallback language generally consistent with the arrc's amendment approach, which provides a streamlined amendment approach for negotiating a benchmark replacement and introduces clarity with respect to the fallback trigger events and an adjustment to be applied to the successor rate.
•we continue to monitor developments by the arrc and other governing bodies involved in libor transition.
refer to note 10 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 and "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about our management of risks related to the transition away from libor.
real estate dispositions and partial interest sales we expect to continue the disciplined execution of select sales of operating assets. future sales will provide an important source of capital to fund a portion of pending and recently completed opportunistic acquisitions and our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects, and also provide significant capital for growth over the next two to three quarters. we may also consider additional sales of partial interests in core class a properties and/or development projects. for 2021, we expect real estate dispositions and partial interest sales ranging from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. the amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of ebitda associated with the assets sold.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, we received proceeds of $1.1 billion, primarily related to our sale of properties at 510 townsend street, 505 brannan street, and 945 market street in our soma submarket, our sale of properties at 9808 and 9868 scranton road in our sorrento mesa submarket, and our partial interest sale of properties at 1201 and 1208 eastlake avenue east and 199 east blaine street in our lake union submarket. the proceeds received were used primarily to fund development and redevelopment projects in our highly leased value-creation pipeline and to fund acquisitions completed in 2020.
as a reit, generally we are subject to a 100% tax on the net income from real estate asset sales that the irs characterizes as "prohibited transactions." we do not expect our sales will be categorized as prohibited transactions. however, unless we meet certain "safe harbor" requirements, whether a real estate asset sale is a prohibited transaction will be based on the facts and circumstances of the sale. our real estate asset sales may not always meet such safe harbor requirements. refer to "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about the "prohibited transaction" tax.
common equity transactions during the year ended december 31, 2020, we completed issuances and executed forward equity sales agreements for an aggregate of 15.7 million shares of common stock, including the exercise of an underwriters' option, for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion, as follows:
•in january 2020 and july 2020, we entered into forward equity sales agreements aggregating $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, to sell an aggregate of 6.9 million shares for each offering (13.8 million in aggregate) of our common stock, including the exercise of underwriters' options, at public offering prices of $155.00 per share and $160.50 per share, respectively, before underwriting discounts. during 2020, we issued all 13.8 million shares under these forward equity sales agreements and received net proceeds of $2.1 billion.
•in february 2020, we entered into an atm common stock offering program, which allowed us to sell up to an aggregate of $850.0 million of our common stock.
•we issued 1.5 million shares of common stock under our atm program at a price of $159.09 per share (before underwriting discounts), and received net proceeds of $235.0 million during 2020.
•we have 362 thousand shares under our atm program subject to forward equity sales agreements that remain outstanding at a price of $159.09 per share (before underwriting discounts) as of december 31, 2020. we expect to settle these forward equity sales agreements in 2021 and receive net proceeds of approximately $56.3 million.
•the remaining availability of $547.3 million under this atm program expired in december 2020 concurrently with the expiration of the associated shelf registration. in january 2021, we filed a new shelf registration statement and expect to establish a new atm program soon in 2021.
other sources under our current shelf registration statement filed with the sec, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. these securities may be issued, from time to time, at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital.
additionally, we hold interests, together with joint venture partners, in real estate joint ventures that we consolidate in our financial statements. these joint venture partners may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we received $367.6 million of contributions from and sales of noncontrolling interests.
uses of capital summary of capital expenditures one of our primary uses of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. we currently have projects in our growth pipeline aggregating 3.3 million rsf of class a office/laboratory and tech office space undergoing construction, 7.1 million rsf of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, and 7.4 million sf of future development projects in north america. we incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction activities. we also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project, during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. refer to the "new class a development and redevelopment properties: current projects" and "summary of capital expenditures" subsections of the "investments in real estate" section under item 2 in this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our capital expenditures.
we capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. capitalized interest for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, of $125.6 million and $88.6 million, respectively, was classified in investments in real estate. indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. we capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction projects, which aggregated $61.0 million and $43.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the increase in capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in our value-creation pipeline projects undergoing construction and pre-construction activities aggregating 11 projects with 7.2 million rsf in 2020 over 2019. pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. for example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $18.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020.
we use third-party brokers to assist in our leasing activity, who are paid on a contingent basis upon successful leasing. we are required to capitalize initial direct costs related to successful leasing transactions that result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not been successfully executed. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we capitalized total initial direct leasing costs of $61.2 million. costs that we incur to negotiate or arrange a lease regardless of its outcome, such as fixed employee compensation, tax, or legal advice to negotiate lease terms, and other costs, are expensed as incurred.
acquisitions refer to the "acquisitions" section in note 3 - "investments in real estate" and to note 4 - "consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for detailed information on our acquisitions.

$532,980                          $451,170          $81,810
the increase in dividends paid on our common stock during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, was primarily due to an increase in number of common shares outstanding subsequent to january 1, 2019, as a result of issuances of common stock under our atm program and settlement of forward equity sales agreements, and partially due to the increase in the related dividends to $4.18 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2020, from $3.94 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2019.
the decrease in dividends paid on our series d convertible preferred stock during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, was due to the repurchase of 275,000 outstanding shares of our series d convertible preferred stock and the conversion of the remaining 2.3 million outstanding shares of our series d convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock during 2019. as a result, we had no outstanding shares of series d convertible preferred stock as of december 31, 2020.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. changes in estimates or policies applied could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k.
reit compliance we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a reit. however, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal and state income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. if we lose our reit status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.
investments in real estate recognition of real estate acquired we evaluate each acquisition of real estate or in-substance real estate (including equity interests in entities that predominantly hold real estate assets) to determine whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meets the definition of a business and needs to be accounted for as a business combination. an acquisition of an integrated set of assets and activities that does not meet the definition of a business is accounted for as an asset acquisition.
for acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate that are accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the acquisition consideration (excluding acquisition costs) to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interests, and previously existing ownership interests at fair value as of the acquisition date. assets include intangible assets such as tenant relationships, acquired in-place leases, and favorable intangibles associated with in-place leases in which we are the lessor. liabilities include unfavorable intangibles associated with in-place leases in which we are the lessor. in addition, for acquired in-place finance or operating leases in which we are the lessee, acquisition consideration is allocated to lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets, adjusted to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of the lease when compared with market terms. any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the fair value of the net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill (bargain purchase gain). acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred.
generally, we expect that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). the accounting model for asset acquisitions is similar to the accounting model for business combinations except that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) is allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. as a result, asset acquisitions do not result in the recognition of goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. incremental and external direct acquisition costs (such as legal and other third-party services) are capitalized.
we exercise judgment to determine the key assumptions used to allocate the purchase price of real estate acquired among its components. the allocation of the consideration to the various components of properties acquired during the year can have an effect on our net income due to the useful depreciable and amortizable lives applicable to each component and the recognition of the related depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of operations. we apply judgment in utilizing available comparable market information to assess relative fair value. we assess the relative fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on available comparable market information, including estimated replacement costs, rental rates, and recent market transactions. in addition, we may use estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates.
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.
the value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of fair value on an "as if vacant" basis. the value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred in the execution of similar leases under the market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. the value of above-market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities reflects the difference between (i) the contractual rents to be paid over the remaining term for each in-place lease and (ii) the estimated current market lease rates using available comparable market information and tenant credit quality. if there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the noncancelable lease term of an in-place lease, we evaluate intangible factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. when we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider the option in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period. we also recognize the relative fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.
we completed acquisitions of 55 properties for a total purchase price of $2.6 billion during the year ended december 31, 2020. these transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair value of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed.
depreciation and amortization the values allocated to buildings and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the respective ground lease term, estimated useful life, or up to 40 years, for buildings and building improvements; estimated life, or up to 20 years, for land improvements; the respective lease term or estimated useful life for tenant improvements; and the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life for equipment. the values of acquired in-place leases and associated favorable intangibles (i.e., acquired above-market leases) are classified in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases as a reduction of income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. the values of unfavorable intangibles (i.e., acquired below-market leases) associated with acquired in-place leases are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases, as an increase in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.
capitalized project costs we capitalize project costs, including pre-construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project. capitalization of development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. should development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
properties classified as held for sale a property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale.
if the disposal of a property represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations or financial results, such as (i) a major line of business, (ii) a major geographic area, (iii) a major equity method investment, or (iv) other major parts of an entity, then the operations of the property, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. the disposal of an individual property generally will not represent a strategic shift and therefore will typically not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation.
impairment of long-lived assets prior to and subsequent to the end of each quarter, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our long-lived assets to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. if triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. triggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, and intangibles, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. we assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. if an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation or amortization is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the asset is expected to be held and used. we may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.
we use the held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. the held for sale impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model. under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.
equity investments we hold investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science, technology, and agtech industries. as a reit, we generally limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%.
our investments in publicly traded companies are classified as investments with readily determinable fair values and are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. the fair values for our investments in publicly traded companies are determined based on sales prices/quotes available on securities exchanges and therefore generally require no judgment to determine fair value. investments in privately held entities that report nav per share, such as our privately held investments in limited partnerships, are carried at fair value using nav as a practical expedient, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. as a result, fair value estimation for these investments generally requires limited judgment. investments in privately held entities that do not report nav are measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes recognized in net income. observable price changes result from, among other things, equity transactions for the same issuer executed during the reporting period, including subsequent equity offerings or other reported equity transactions related to the same issuer. for these equity transactions to be considered observable price changes of the same issuer, we evaluate whether these transactions have similar rights and obligations, including voting rights, distribution preferences, conversion rights, and other factors, to the investments we hold.
we monitor investments in privately held entities that do not report nav per share throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, prospects and results of clinical trials, new product initiatives, new collaborative agreements, capital-raising events, and merger and acquisition activities. these investments are evaluated on the basis of a qualitative assessment for indicators of impairment by monitoring the presence of the following triggering events or impairment indicators: (i) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; (ii) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (iii) a significant adverse change in the general market condition, including the research and development of technology and products that the investee is bringing or attempting to bring to the market, or (iv) significant concerns about the investee's ability to continue as a going concern. if such indicators are present, we are required to estimate the investment's fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the investment's carrying value in excess of its estimated fair value.
liability and right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee we have operating lease agreements in which we are the lessee consisting of ground and office leases. at the lease commencement date (or at the acquisition date if the lease is acquired as part of a real estate acquisition), we are required to recognize a liability to account for our future obligations under these operating leases, and a corresponding right-of-use asset.
the lease liability is measured based on the present value of the future lease payments, including payments during the term under our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. the present value of the future lease payments is calculated for each operating lease using each respective remaining lease term and a corresponding estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is the interest rate that we estimate we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments. subsequently, the lease liability is accreted by applying a discount rate established at the lease commencement date to the lease liability balance as of the beginning of the period and is reduced by the payments made during the period. we classify the operating lease liability in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
the right-of-use asset is measured based on the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for initial direct leasing costs and any other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, as well as adjustments to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of an acquired lease when compared with market terms at the time of acquisition. subsequently, the right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis during the lease term. we classify the right-of-use asset in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. refer to the "lessee accounting" subsection of "lease accounting" section within note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k.
monitoring of tenant credit quality during the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants by (i) monitoring the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments.
allowance for credit losses on january 1, 2020, we adopted an accounting standard that requires companies to estimate and recognize lifetime expected losses, rather than incurred losses, which results in the earlier recognition of credit losses even if the expected risk of credit loss is remote. the accounting standard applies to most financial assets including trade receivables and direct financing leases. the standard does not apply to the receivables arising from operating leases. upon adoption of the new standard on january 1, 2020, we recognized a credit loss adjustment related to adoption of this accounting standard as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. for details, refer to the "allowance for credit losses" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies"
we have one lease classified as a direct financing lease subject to this standard. in this direct financing lease, the payment obligation of the lessee is collateralized by real estate property. at each reporting date, we estimate the current credit loss related to this asset by assessing the probability of default on this lease based on the lessee's financial condition, credit rating, business prospects, remaining lease term, and expected value of the underlying collateral upon its repossession, and, if necessary, we recognize a credit loss adjustment. we recognized subsequent credit loss adjustments related to our direct financing lease in our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december 31, 2020. for further details, refer to note 5 - "leases" to our consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap measures and definitions this section contains additional information of certain non-gaap financial measures and the reasons why we use these supplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other terms used in this annual report on form 10-k.
funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to alexandria real estate equities, inc.'s common stockholders gaap-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. in an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the nareit board of governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. since its introduction, funds from operations has become a widely used non-gaap financial measure among equity reits. we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity reit. moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate acquisition and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structure, capital market transactions, variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control, or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.
on january 1, 2019, we adopted standards established by the nareit board of governors in its november 2018 white paper (the "nareit white paper") on a prospective basis. the nareit white paper defines funds from operations as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization of operating real estate assets, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and real estate joint ventures. impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period.
we compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the nareit white paper, excluding significant gains, losses, and impairments realized on non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on early termination of interest rate hedge agreements, significant termination fees, acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the resignation of an executive officer, preferred stock redemption charges, deal costs, the income tax effect related to such items, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, should be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as indications of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as measures of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. adjusted ebitda is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda"), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, impairments of real estate, and significant termination fees. adjusted ebitda also excludes unrealized gains or losses and significant realized gains and impairments that result from our non-real estate investments. these non-real estate investment amounts are classified in our consolidated statements of operations outside of revenues.
we believe adjusted ebitda provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments, our capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. for example, we exclude gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. we believe that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, significant impairments and gains on the sale of non-real estate investments, and significant termination fees allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.
in addition, we believe that excluding charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for investors a comparison of our business activities across periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. adjusted ebitda has limitations as a measure of our performance. adjusted ebitda does not reflect our historical expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. while adjusted ebitda is a relevant measure of performance, it does not represent net income (loss) or cash flows from operations calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.
in order to calculate adjusted ebitda margin, we also make comparable adjustments to our revenues. we adjust our total revenues by realized gains, losses, and impairments related to our non-real estate investments and significant termination fees to arrive at revenues, as adjusted. our calculation of adjusted ebitda margin divides adjusted ebitda by our revenues, as adjusted. we believe that consistent application of these comparable adjustments to both components of adjusted ebitda margin provides a more useful calculation for the comparison across periods.
the following table reconciles net income (loss) and revenues, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to adjusted ebitda and revenues, as adjusted, respectively, for the three months and years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):

annual rental revenue annual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental obligations, calculated in accordance with gaap, for leases in effect as of the end of the period, related to our operating rsf. annual rental revenue is presented using 100% of the annual rental revenue of our consolidated properties and our share of annual rental revenue for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. annual rental revenue per rsf is computed by dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100% of the rsf of our consolidated properties and our share of the rsf of properties held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. as of december 31, 2020, approximately 94% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. amounts recovered from our tenants related to these operating expenses, along with base rent, are classified in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.
cash interest cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). refer to the definition of "fixed-charge coverage ratio" in this section under this item 7 in this annual report on 10-k for a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to cash interest.
class a properties and aaa locations class a properties are properties clustered in aaa locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. class a properties generally command higher annual rental rates than other classes of similar properties.
aaa locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space.
development, redevelopment, and pre-construction a key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new class a properties, and property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties, located in collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in aaa urban innovation clusters. these projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide range of tenants. upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.
development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable facilities. redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into office/laboratory, tech office, or agtech space. we generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new class a office/laboratory, tech office, and agtech space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality class a properties.
pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to generate significant revenue and cash flows.
development, redevelopment, and pre-construction spending also includes the following costs: (i) certain tenant improvements and renovations that will be reimbursed, (ii) amounts to bring certain acquired properties up to market standard and/or other costs identified during the acquisition process (generally within two years of acquisition), and (iii) permanent conversion of space for highly flexible, move-in-ready office/laboratory space to foster the growth of promising early- and growth-stage life science companies.
revenue-enhancing and repositioning capital expenditures represent spending to reposition or significantly change the use of a property, including through improvement in the asset quality from class b to class a.
non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures represent costs required to maintain the current revenues of a stabilized property, including the associated costs for renewed and re-leased space.
fixed-charge coverage ratio fixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-gaap financial measure representing the ratio of adjusted ebitda to fixed charges. we believe this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts).
the following table reconciles interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to cash interest and fixed charges for the three months ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):

initial stabilized yield is calculated as the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization divided by our investment in the property. our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. we expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs.
•initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.
•initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed and our total cash investment in the property.
investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded companies with an average daily market capitalization greater than $10 billion for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, as reported by bloomberg professional services. in addition, we monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. material changes that cause a tenant's market capitalization to decline below $10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the twelve-month average, may result in their exclusion from this measure.

joint venture financial information we present components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures, which are not presented, or intended to be presented, in accordance with gaap. we present the proportionate share of certain financial line items as follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, which are controlled by us through contractual rights or majority voting rights, but of which we own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control and do not consolidate, and are instead controlled jointly or by our joint venture partners through contractual rights or majority voting rights, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented.
the components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures do not represent our legal claim to those items. for each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity holders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. equity holders are normally entitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and claims have been repaid or satisfied.
we believe this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial statements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in our consolidated results.
the components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures are limited as an analytical tool as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures' assets, liabilities, or results of operations. in addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the unconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. we believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with gaap.
net cash provided by operating activities after dividends net cash provided by operating activities after dividends includes the deduction for distributions to noncontrolling interests. for purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences.
net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure in evaluating our balance sheet leverage. net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, plus preferred stock outstanding as of the end of the period. refer to the definition of "adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin" under item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the calculation of adjusted ebitda.

net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure calculated as net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, excluding equity in the earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and investment income or loss. we believe net operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure for investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. net operating income on a cash basis is net operating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue adjustments required by gaap. we believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases.
furthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure for our consolidated properties because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, which provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. net operating income can be used to measure the initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating net operating income generated by a property divided by our investment in the property. net operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. in addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level. impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. these impairments result from investing decisions or a deterioration in market conditions. we also exclude realized and unrealized investment income or loss, which results from investment decisions that occur at the corporate level related to non-real estate investments in publicly traded companies and certain privately held entities. therefore, we do not consider these activities to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property level. our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to corporate strategy. property operating expenses included in determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. general and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. we calculate operating margin as net operating income divided by total revenues.
we believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should be examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions.
operating statistics we present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, rsf, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. we believe these measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. we compute the number of properties, rsf, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100% for all properties in which we have an investment, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. for operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to the definition of "annual rental revenue" in this "non-gaap measures and definitions" section.
same property comparisons as a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from assets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently placed into service, the consolidated total income from rentals, as well as rental operating expenses in our operating results, can show significant changes from period to period. in order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given quarterly or annual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the entirety of the comparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. we separately present quarterly and year-to-date same property results to align with the interim financial information required by the sec in our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. these same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day in the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any time during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for sale, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. additionally, termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties. refer to the "same properties" subsection in the "results of operations" section within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
stabilized occupancy date the stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or greater.
tenant recoveries tenant recoveries represent revenues comprising reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses and earned in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.
we classify rental revenues and tenant recoveries generated through the leasing of real estate assets within revenue in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. we provide investors with a separate presentation of rental revenues and tenant recoveries in the "comparison of results for the year ended december 31, 2020, to the year ended december 31, 2019" subsection of the "results of operations" section within this item 7 because we believe it promotes investors' understanding of our operating results. we believe that the presentation of tenant recoveries is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to recover operating expenses under our triple net leases, including recoveries of utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes, common area expenses, and other operating expenses, and of our ability to mitigate the effect to net income for any significant variability to components of our operating expenses.

unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets as it reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. unencumbered net operating income is derived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest, as of the period for which income is presented.

weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding - diluted from time to time, we enter into capital market transactions, including forward equity sales agreements ("forward agreements"), to fund acquisitions, to fund construction of our highly leased development and redevelopment projects, and for general working capital purposes. we are required to consider the potential dilutive effect of our forward equity sales agreements under the treasury stock method while the forward equity sales agreements are outstanding. as of december 31, 2020, we had forward agreements outstanding to sell an aggregate of 362 thousand shares of common stock.
prior to the conversion of our remaining outstanding shares in october 2019, we considered the effect of assumed conversion of our outstanding 7.00% series d convertible preferred stock when determining potentially dilutive incremental shares to our common stock. when calculating the assumed conversion, we add back to net income or loss the dividends paid on our series d convertible preferred stock to the numerator and then include additional common shares assumed to have been issued (as displayed in the table below) to the denominator of the per share calculation. the effect of the assumed conversion is considered separately for our per share calculations of net income or loss; funds from operations, computed in accordance with the definition in the nareit white paper; and funds from operations, as adjusted. prior to the conversion of our remaining outstanding shares in october 2019, our series d convertible preferred stock was dilutive and assumed to be converted when quarterly and annual basic eps, funds from operations, or funds from operations, as adjusted, exceeded approximately $1.75 and $7.00 per share, respectively, subject to conversion ratio adjustments and the impact of repurchases of our series d convertible preferred stock. the effect of the assumed conversion was included when it was dilutive on a per share basis. the dilutive effect to both numerator and denominator may result in a per share effect of less than a half cent, which would appear as zero in our per share calculation, even when the dilutive effect to the numerator alone appears in our reconciliation. refer to note 12 - "earnings per share" and note 15 - "stockholders' equity" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to our forward equity sales agreements.

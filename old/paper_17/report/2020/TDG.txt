item 1a.    risk factors set forth below are material risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements contained in this report. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition.
risks related to our strategy we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales.
in fiscal year 2020, no customer individually accounted for 10% or more of the company's net sales; however, our top ten customers for fiscal year 2020 accounted for approximately 44% of our net sales. in fiscal year 2019, one customer individually accounted for approximately 11% of the company's net sales. in fiscal year 2018, two customers individually accounted for approximately 11% and 10% of the company's net sales. a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason, including but not limited to economic downturn, decreased production, strike or resourcing, could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products. further, when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers, we take the risk for cost overruns.
as is customary in our business, we do not generally have long-term contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and, therefore, do not have guaranteed future sales. although we have long-term contracts with many of our oem customers, many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and, in most cases, our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products. in addition, in certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements, and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize.
we also have entered into multi-year, fixed-price contracts with some of our customers, pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and, accordingly, realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products. sometimes we accept a fixed-price contract for a product that we have not yet produced, and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices, taxes or labor costs.
we intend to pursue acquisitions. our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations.
a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions. any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy. however, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms or may be unable to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support. in addition, we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions. because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight.
we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. if we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs.
acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect. in addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business. the successful integration of new businesses, with the most significant recent acquisition being the esterline acquisition in march 2019, depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business, which could decrease the time that they have to service, attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities.
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.
we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of september 30, 2020, our total indebtedness, excluding approximately $39.4 million of letters of credit outstanding, was approximately $20.0 billion, which was 124.8% of our total book capitalization. we incurred approximately $3.1 billion in net new incremental borrowings during fiscal 2020 both for general corporate purposes and as a precautionary response to macroeconomic conditions caused by the covid-19 pandemic.
in addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. as of september 30, 2020, we had approximately $520.6 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility. although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the various senior secured and senior subordinated notes outstanding (the "indentures") contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial. a breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures.
an increase in our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to investors. for example, it could:
•increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions;
•increase the risk we are subjected to downgrade or put on a negative watch by the ratings agencies;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and
•limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the documents governing our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, make investments and incur liens.
all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility, which includes $7.4 billion in term loans and a revolving loan facility of $760 million, bears interest at variable rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") for deposits of u.s. dollars. accordingly, if libor or other variable interest rates increase, our debt service expense will also increase. in order to mitigate the interest rate risk of these variable rate borrowings, we are entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements that covers a significant portion of the existing variable rate debt. for information about our interest rate swap and cap agreements, see note 21, "derivatives and hedging instruments," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
in addition, on july 27, 2017, the financial conduct authority ("fca") in the united kingdom ("u.k.") announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of calendar year 2021. as a result, in february 2020, we amended our senior secured credit facility to incorporate an alternative reference rate effective upon the cessation date of libor. we will also take the necessary steps to amend our interest rate swap and cap agreements. the expected cessation of libor may require us to amend certain other agreements and although the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") is expected to be the alternative rate that replaces libor, we cannot predict what margin adjustments and related terms would be negotiated with our counterparties. as a result, our interest expense could increase.
our indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness, including the indentures. we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness. if we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital.
to service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the indentures, amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility, amounts due under our trade receivable securitization facility ("securitization facility"), and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule, or at all, or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility, amounts borrowed under our securitization facility and the indentures, or to fund our other liquidity needs. if we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. we cannot assure that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. the terms of existing or future debt instruments, the securitization facility, the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. in addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the indentures.
the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group, transdigm inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and transdigm inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the indentures) and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of td group, transdigm inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and transdigm inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the indentures) to:
•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;
•pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;
•make investments;
•sell assets;
•enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;
•incur or allow to exist liens;
•consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;
•engage in transactions with affiliates;
•create unrestricted subsidiaries; and
•engage in certain business activities.
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures. if any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the senior secured and senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. in addition, following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility, the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes. if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the senior secured or subordinated notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.
we are dependent on our senior management team and highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business.
because our products are complicated and highly engineered, we depend on an educated and trained workforce. historically, there has been substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aerospace and defense industry, and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees. we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel.
reduction in force actions, such as the actions taken to reduce our workforce to align operations with customer demand as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, could result in difficulty in rehiring capable employees to refill the positions eliminated as needed once business recovers.
although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable. because we strive to limit the volume of finished goods inventory, any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers.
in addition, our success depends in part on our ability to attract and motivate our senior management and key employees. achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, competitors' hiring practices, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. competition for qualified personnel can be intense. a loss of senior management and key personnel, or failure to attract qualified new talent could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities, and our operating results and/or market value could be adversely affected. the company's board of directors continually monitors this risk and we believe that the board of director's succession plan, together with our straightforward strategy, clear value drivers, decentralized nature and the quality of managers running our operating units helps to mitigate this risk.
risks related to our operations our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical, and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us.
our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft, such as the boeing company, airbus s.a.s, and related oem suppliers, as well as manufacturers of business jets have historically experienced periodic downturns. in the past, these sales have been affected by airline profitability, which is impacted by, among other things, fuel and labor costs, price competition, interest rates, downturns in the global economy and national and international events. in addition, sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by, among other things, downturns in the global economy. in particular, commercial and business jet market channel sales have been negatively impacted by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. downturns adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers.
our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components. our business, therefore, could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers (such as the destruction of our suppliers' facilities or their distribution infrastructure, a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers' employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality), or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers. the covid-19 pandemic has also disrupted the global supply chain to a certain extent. because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part.
we face significant competition.
we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies. competitors in our product lines are both u.s. and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately-held entities. we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance, consistent high quality, short lead-time and timely delivery, competitive pricing, superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive.
our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities, which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production.
a number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area, an area known for earthquakes and fires, and are thus vulnerable to damage. in addition, a number of our manufacturing facilities are located along the eastern seaboard area susceptible to hurricanes. we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power loss, fire, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. disruptions could also occur due to health-related outbreaks and crises, cyber-attacks, computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error or process failures. should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
operations and sales outside of the united states may be subject to additional risks.
a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including global health crises, currency fluctuations, difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations, general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate, limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, change in trade policies, tariff regulation, difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition. issues with the global supply chain can also rise due to some of the aforementioned risks as well as global health crises, such as the covid-19 pandemic. furthermore, the company is subject to laws and regulations, such as the foreign corrupt practices act, uk bribery act and similar local anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their employees, agents and contractors from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. failure to comply with these laws could subject the company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
in june 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union ("e.u.") commonly referred to as "brexit." the u.k. subsequently withdrew from the european union on january 31, 2020, subject to a transition period that is set to end on december 31, 2020. although it is unknown what the terms of the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u. will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the u.k. and e.u. countries and increased regulatory complexities. these changes could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business and the business of existing and future customers and suppliers as well as have an impact on our employees based in europe, which could adversely impact our business. the actual effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the u.k. makes to retain access to e.u. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.
we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the u.s. government.
companies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to u.s. government agencies, whether through direct contracts with the u.s. government or a as a subcontractor to customers contracting with the u.s. government, are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. these risks include the ability of the u.s. government to unilaterally:
•suspend us from receiving new contracts based on alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;
•terminate existing contracts;
•revoke required security clearances;
•reduce the value of existing contracts; and
•audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.
most of our u.s. government contracts can be terminated by the u.s. government at its convenience without significant notice. termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination.
on contracts for which the price is based on cost, the u.s. government may review our costs and performance, as well as our accounting and general business practices. based on the results of such audits, the u.s. government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. in addition, under u.s. government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including most financing costs, amortization of intangible assets, portions of research and development costs, and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement.
furthermore, even where the price is not based on cost, the u.s. government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is "fair and reasonable." our subsidiaries are periodically subject to pricing reviews and government buying agencies that purchase some of our subsidiaries' products are periodically subject to audits by the dod office of inspector general ("oig") with respect to prices paid for such products. in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we voluntarily refunded $16 million to the u.s. government following an oig audit, and another oig audit is underway. in addition, our defense-related business is the subject of an ongoing congressional inquiry by the house oversight committee. pricing reviews and government audits, including the audit underway, and the congressional inquiry are costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business. as a result of these reviews, audits and inquiries, we could be subject to providing further refunds to the u.s. government, we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost, the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts, or the u.s. government could take other adverse actions with respect to our contracts. any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from, or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with, certain agencies and buying organizations of the u.s. government. further, negative publicity relating to the results of any audit, inquiry or subsequent hearing or the like could negatively impact our stock price.
if a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with u.s. government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
moreover, u.s. government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operational requirements, which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting. failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations.
our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased.
the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the u.s. and in other countries. in order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must be certified by the faa, the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers. if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases, we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight. in addition, if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our business would be adversely affected.
in addition to the aviation approvals, we are at times required to obtain approval from u.s. government agencies to export our products. u.s. laws and regulations applicable to us include the arms export control act, the international traffic in arms regulations ("itar"), the export administration regulations ("ear") and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the united states department of the treasury's office of foreign assets control ("ofac"). ear restricts the export of dual-use products and technical data to certain countries, while itar restricts the export of defense products, technical data and defense services.
failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the u.s. government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states, and the penalties that could be imposed by the u.s. government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant.
we could incur substantial costs as a result of data protection concerns.
the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the u.s., europe, including but not limited to the general data protection regulation (the "gdpr") and the california consumer privacy act (the "ccpa"), and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. complying with these various laws is difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. further, although we have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the gdpr, ccpa and other privacy-related laws, rules and regulations (collectively, the "data protection laws"), there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will enable us to be fully compliant with all data protection laws.
despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and implement data security measures, our facilities, and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches and other data loss, including cyber-attacks and, in fact, we have experienced data security incidents that have not had a material impact on our financial results. in addition, it is not possible to predict the impact on our business of the future loss, alteration or misappropriation of information in our possession related to us, our employees, former employees, customers, suppliers or others. this could lead to negative publicity, legal claims, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes, operational disruptions and other significant costs, which could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
risks related to legal and regulatory matters we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.
our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees. environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. certain facilities and third-party sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws. the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws.
estimates of the company's environmental liabilities are based on current facts, laws, regulations and technology. these estimates take into consideration the company's prior experience and professional judgment of the company's environmental advisors. estimates of the company's environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, the range of remediation alternatives available, evolving remediation standards, imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates, the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation.
accordingly, as investigations and remediations proceed, it is likely that adjustments in the company's accruals will be necessary to reflect new information. the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or cash flows in a given period. based on currently available information, however, the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition.
we may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including fair labor standards act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.
from time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. these actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers' compensation, employment discrimination, or breach of contract. in addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits, including those involving allegations of violations of consumer product statutes or the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws. due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. the outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. in addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. the ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we could be adversely affected if one of our products cause an aircraft to crash.
our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft product that we have designed, manufactured or serviced. while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate. we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us.
in addition, a crash caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for quality products. we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft products. if a crash were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.
risks related to financial matters we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets, which may never generate the returns we expect.
mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. identifiable intangible assets, which primarily include trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, and technology, were approximately $2.6 billion at september 30, 2020, representing approximately 14% of our total assets. goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately $7.9 billion at september 30, 2020, representing approximately 43% of our total assets. we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards, we would be required to write-off the amount of any impairment.
volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and required pension contributions.
the company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans. certain qualified defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities and other investments. among other factors, changes in interest rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost; and (iii) increase our future contribution requirements. a significant decrease in investment returns or the market value of plan assets or a significant decrease in interest rates could increase our net periodic pension costs and adversely affect our results of operations. a significant increase in our contribution requirements with respect to our qualified defined benefit pension plans could have an adverse impact on our cash flows.
we may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. the company's domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. the company's future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the company's effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations. in addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company's tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations.
we do not regularly declare and pay quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock.
notwithstanding special cash dividends, of which the most recent declaration by the company's board of directors occurred on december 20, 2019 in the amount of $32.50 per outstanding share of common stock and and cash dividend equivalent payments on options granted under its equity compensation plans, we do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future.
the amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements. any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. therefore, shareholders should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all.
general risks we face risks related to the current covid-19 pandemic and other health pandemics, epidemics and outbreaks.
the global outbreak of covid-19 is currently impacting countries, communities, supply chains, and markets. the covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our commercial oem and commercial aftermarket sales and will continue to do so for an indeterminate length of time. the impact of the covid-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, and therefore, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows will ultimately be impacted. because this situation is ongoing and because the duration and severity of the outbreak are unclear, it is difficult to forecast the impact on the company's future results. however, we currently expect covid-19 to have a significant adverse impact on our sales, net income and ebitda as defined continuing at least into fiscal 2021 under the assumption that the covid-19 outbreak will adversely affect our non-defense customers and their demand for our products and services for at least the near term.
the covid-19 pandemic has also disrupted our operations. the outbreak of covid-19 has heightened the risk that a significant portion of our workforce will suffer illness or otherwise be unable to work. furthermore, in light of our reduction in workforce to align operations with customer demand caused by the covid-19 pandemic, we cannot assure that we will be able to rehire our entire workforce once our business has recovered. certain of our facilities have experienced temporary disruptions as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict whether our facilities will experience more significant disruptions in the future. furthermore, our acquisition strategy, which is a key element of our overall business strategy, may be impacted by our efforts to maintain the company's liquidity position in response to the covid-19 pandemic. finally, future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks described above.
our commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers' planes spend aloft, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers' profitability. these items are, in turn, affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions.
our commercial business is directly affected by, among other factors, changes in rpms, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet, the percentage of the fleet that is out-of-warranty and changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry. rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment, although national and international events also play a key role. for example, in addition to the current covid-19 pandemic and the adverse impact it has had on the airline industry, past examples in which the airline industry has been negatively affected include downturns in the global economy, higher fuel prices, increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11, 2001, the severe acute respiratory syndrome ("sars") epidemic, and conflicts abroad. additional examples include future geopolitical or other worldwide events, such as war, terrorist acts, or additional worldwide infectious disease outbreaks.
in addition, global market and economic conditions have been challenging due to turbulence in the u.s. and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending. as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from the aforementioned events, the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties. some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights. during periods of reduced airline profitability, some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts, preferring instead to deplete existing inventories, and delay refurbishments and discretionary spending. if demand for spare parts decreases, there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products. an adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets.
u.s. military spending is dependent upon the u.s. defense budget.
the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends, particularly the dod budget. in addition to normal business risks, our supply of products to the u.s. government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control. dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy as a result of the presidential election or otherwise, the u.s. government's budget deficits, spending priorities (e.g., allocating more spending to combat the effects of the covid-19 pandemic), the cost of sustaining the u.s. military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce u.s. government military spending, each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline. a significant decline in u.s. military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the u.s. government.
our stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.
there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is unrelated to the operating performance of the companies issuing the securities. these market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. such changes could be caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects, including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering, which could cause short-term swings in profit margins. or such changes could be unrelated to our operating performance, such as changes in market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies or changes in the outlook for our common stock, such as changes to or the confidence in our business strategy, changes to or confidence in our management, or expectations for future growth of the company. global health crises such as the current covid-19 pandemic, with the breadth of its impact worldwide, could also cause significant volatility in the market price.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with "selected financial data" and td group's consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. the following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled "risk factors" included elsewhere in this report. these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.
overview for fiscal year 2020, we generated net sales of $5,103 million, gross profit of $2,647 million or 51.9% of sales, and net income attributable to td group of $699 million. while the covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our operations in the short-term, we believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. more specifically, focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term.
our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business. the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business.
we believe our key competitive strengths include:
large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream. we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products. we estimate that our products are installed on over 100,000 commercial transport, regional transport, military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft.
diversified revenue base. we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance. our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production. we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, many of our businesses have taken the opportunity to explore new business opportunities by working on developing highly engineered solutions for emerging needs arising from the pandemic. product solutions currently being explored include anti-viral or antimicrobial technology, air purification, and touchless technologies, among others.
barriers to entry. we believe that the niche nature of our markets, the industry's stringent regulatory and certification requirements, the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create potential disincentives to competition for certain products.
our business strategy is made up of two key elements: (1) a value-driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and (2) a selective acquisition strategy.
value-driven operating strategy. our three core value drivers are:
•obtaining profitable new business. we attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise and application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate. we have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and oem products to drive our growth.
•improving our cost structure. we are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure, with a focus on reducing the cost of each.
•providing highly engineered value-added products to customers. we focus on the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers. we believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products. this has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so.
selective acquisition strategy. we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. the aerospace industry, in particular, remains highly fragmented, with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non-core operations of larger businesses. we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture. as of the date of this report, we have successfully acquired approximately 85 businesses and product lines since our formation in 1993. many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility, which enables a higher production capacity utilization, which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume.
acquisitions and divestitures during the most recent three fiscal years are more fully described in note 2, "acquisitions and divestitures," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
impact of the covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic caused a significant adverse impact on our sales, net income and ebitda as defined for fiscal 2020 and is expected to continue to do so into fiscal 2021. this is under the assumption that the covid-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact customer demand for all market channels, with commercial oem and commercial aftermarket being the most adversely impacted due to the pandemic's impact on air travel worldwide. the defense market channel is also impacted to a lesser extent due to certain supply chain disruptions as well as the "stay at home" orders, quarantines, etc. impacting the government procurement workforce which has slowed production and/or orders. also, government funding reprioritization such as shifting funds to efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic provides for uncertainty. the magnitude of the impact of covid-19 remains unpredictable and we, therefore, continue to anticipate potential supply chain disruptions, employee absenteeism and short-term suspensions of manufacturing facilities, and additional health and safety costs related to the covid-19 pandemic that could unfavorably impact our business. longer term, because the duration of the pandemic is unclear, it is difficult to forecast a precise impact on the company's future results. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, many of our businesses have taken the opportunity to explore new business opportunities by working on developing highly engineered solutions for emerging needs arising from the pandemic. product solutions currently being explored include anti-viral or antimicrobial technology, air purification, and touchless technologies, among others.
the company took immediate and aggressive action to minimize the spread of covid-19 in our workplaces and reduce costs. since the early days of the pandemic, we have been following guidance from the world health organization and the u.s. center for disease control to protect employees and prevent the spread of the virus within all of our facilities globally. some of the actions implemented included: flexible work-from-home scheduling; alternate shift schedules; pre-shift temperature screenings, where allowed by law; social distancing; appropriate personal protective equipment; facility deep cleaning; and paid quarantine time for impacted employees. material actions to reduce costs included: (1) reducing its workforce to align operations with customer demand; (2) implementing unpaid furloughs and salary reductions; and (3) delaying non-essential capital projects and minimizing discretionary spending.
for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020, covid-19 restructuring costs incurred were approximately $46 million, of which $37 million was recorded in cost of sales and $9 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses. these were costs related to the company's actions to reduce its workforce to align with customer demand. additionally, the company incurred approximately $5 million in incremental costs related to the pandemic that are not expected to recur once the pandemic has subsided and are clearly separable from normal operations (e.g., additional cleaning and disinfecting of facilities by contractors above and beyond normal requirements, personal protective equipment, etc.).
as of september 30, 2020, the restructuring accrual associated with the costs incurred in response to the covid-19 pandemic was approximately $13 million. the company expects to incur and pay additional restructuring costs during fiscal 2021 related to the covid-19 pandemic though at a reduced level in comparison to fiscal 2020. the company continues to analyze its cost structure and may implement additional cost reduction measures as necessary due to the ongoing business challenges resulting from the covid-19 pandemic.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. however, investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. for additional significant accounting policies, see note 3, "summary of significant accounting policies," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
revenue recognition: revenue is recognized from the sale of products when control transfers to the customer, which is demonstrated by our right to payment, a transfer of title, a transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership, or the customer acceptance, but most frequently upon shipment where the customer obtains physical possession of the goods. the majority of the company's revenue is recorded at a point in time. sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. for agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. these estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time.
inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out ("fifo") methods and includes material, labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process. because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in-service for 25 or more years, it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use. where management estimated that the net realizable value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales. although management believes that the company's estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future. in addition, in accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales, even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year. historically, changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant.
goodwill and other intangible assets: in accordance with asc 805, "business combinations," the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized as goodwill. the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, revenue growth rates, discount rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. we determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. fair value adjustments to the company's assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition.
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the company's intent to do so. goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates.
u.s. gaap requires that the annual, and any interim, impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment. substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction. with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit, any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit.
at the time of goodwill impairment testing, the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. the quantitative test is required only if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit. for the quantitative test, management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value, impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist. the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing. the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") methodology. the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used. the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business.
management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. terminal value rate determination follows a common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long-term growth rates.
given the adverse global economic and market conditions attributable to the covid-19 pandemic, particularly as it pertains to the commercial sector of the aerospace and defense industry, the company determined that an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was necessary as of march 28, 2020 for certain reporting units in which it was concluded a potential impairment existed. for the identified reporting units, a step 1 impairment test was performed using an income approach based on management's determination of the prospective financial information with consideration taken of the existing uncertainty in the global economy and aerospace and defense industry, particularly the commercial sector. management also included projected declines and subsequent recovery in commercial oem and aftermarket as a percentage of sales based on available industry data. the company utilized a third party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the wacc. the results of this test indicated the fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units tested.
the company had 49 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the date of the annual impairment test. based on its initial qualitative assessment over each of the reporting units, the company identified 19 reporting units to test for impairment using step 1 of the quantitative test. the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units was in excess of its respective carrying value, and therefore, no goodwill impairment was recorded. the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values. with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate, all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values.
management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition. the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values. if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. in this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in company-specific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts. management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset. terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long-term growth rates.
the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. actual results could differ from these assumptions. management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions.
stock-based compensation: the cost of the company's stock-based compensation is recorded in accordance with asc 718, "stock compensation." the company uses a black-scholes pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the stock options awarded. the black-scholes pricing model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company's common shares, the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the stock options award and the company's dividend yield. the company utilizes historical data in determining the assumptions. an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management's control could have an impact on the black-scholes pricing model. the company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data. the total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by actual and estimated forfeitures. changes to the actual and estimated forfeitures will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period of change. the company also evaluates any subsequent changes to the respective option holders terms under the modification rules of asc 718. if determined to be a modification, the black-scholes pricing model is updated as of the date of the modification resulting in a cumulative catch up to expense.
income taxes: the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates. this involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. to the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur. historically, such adjustments have not been significant.

the decrease in organic sales for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 is primarily related to decreases in commercial aftermarket sales ($410 million, a decrease of 25.7%), commercial oem sales ($355 million, a decrease of 24.5%) and other non-aerospace sales ($9 million, a decrease of 3.4%); partially offset by an increase in defense sales ($49 million, an increase of 2.5%).
the decreases in the commercial aftermarket and commercial oem markets are attributable to the adverse impact that the covid-19 pandemic had on customer demand beginning in march 2020 due to the pandemic's impact on air travel demand worldwide. commercial oem sales were also adversely impacted by the 737 max production slowdown. the increase in defense sales is primarily attributable to sales growth in the power & control segment ($59 million).
acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their respective acquisition date. the acquisition sales in the table above were attributable to the sales recorded by the esterline businesses.

the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 was primarily due to a full fiscal year of ownership of the esterline businesses in fiscal 2020 (compared to approximately 6.5 months of ownership in fiscal 2019) in addition to the other factors summarized above.
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 1.9 percentage points to 51.9% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 from 53.8% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019. the decrease in the gross profit percentage is primarily driven by the sales mix, specifically, lower commercial aftermarket sales, the dilutive effect a full year of esterline sales have on the gross profit percentage (as integration activities associated with the three core value drivers continued into fiscal 2020), covid-19 restructuring charges and foreign currency losses, partially offset by a reduction in inventory acquisition accounting adjustments. also, fixed overhead costs incurred were spread over a lower production volume resulting in an adverse impact to gross profit during the second half of fiscal 2020.
•selling and administrative expenses. selling and administrative expenses decreased by $21 million to $727 million, or 14.2% of sales, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 from $748 million, or 14.3% of sales, for the comparable period in the prior year. selling and administrative expenses and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (amounts in millions):

the decrease in total selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 is primarily due to lower acquisition-related expenses and cost mitigation measures enacted during the second half of fiscal 2020 in response to the covid-19 pandemic. the material cost mitigation measures enacted beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 are described in note 1, "description of the business and impact of covid-19 pandemic," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. partially offsetting the decrease in selling and administrative expenses is an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a result of a full fiscal year of ownership of the esterline businesses in fiscal 2020 (compared to approximately 6.5 months of ownership in fiscal 2019).
•amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets was $169 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 compared to $135 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019. the increase in amortization expense of $34 million was primarily due to the amortization expense on the definite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with the fiscal 2019 acquisition of esterline.
•interest expense-net. interest expense-net includes interest on borrowings outstanding, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premium and revolving credit facility fees, slightly offset by interest income. interest expense-net increased $170 million, or 19.8%, to $1,029 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 from $859 million for the comparable period in the prior year. the increase in interest expense-net was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings, which was approximately $19.1 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 compared to approximately $15.5 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019. the increase in the weighted average level of borrowings was primarily due to the activity in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 consisting of the issuance of $4.0 billion in 2026 secured notes and the issuance of $550 million in 7.50% 2027 notes and the activity in fiscal 2020 consisting of the issuance of $2.65 billion in 5.50% 2027 notes, $1.1 billion in 2025 secured notes, $400 million in 6.25% 2026 new notes and a $200 million draw on the revolving credit facility. the increases in new debt described above were slightly offset by the redemptions of $550 million in 5.50% senior subordinated notes (the "2020 notes") in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and $1.15 billion in 6.00% senior subordinated notes (the "2022 notes") in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. the weighted average interest rate for cash interest payments on total borrowings outstanding for the period ended september 30, 2020 was 5.22%.
•refinancing costs. refinancing costs of $28 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 and primarily related to fees incurred on the early redemption of the 2022 notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. refinancing costs of $3 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 and primarily related to the debt financing activities that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
•other income. other income of $46 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 and primarily relates to proceeds or proceeds receivable from business interruption insurance settlements and non-service related components of net periodic benefit costs on the company's defined benefit pension plans.
•income taxes. income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 11.7% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 compared to 20.9% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019. the company's lower effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 was primarily due to incrementally higher excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation along with an increase of the irc 163(j) interest disallowance limitations from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income as modified by the cares act.
•income from discontinued operations. discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 include the results of the operations of souriau-sunbank. discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 include the results of the operations of souriau-sunbank and the eit group of businesses. both businesses were acquired by transdigm as part of its acquisition of esterline in march 2019. on december 20, 2019, transdigm completed the divestiture of souriau-sunbank to eaton for approximately $920 million. on september 20, 2019, transdigm completed the divestiture of eit to an affiliate of kps capital partners, lp for approximately $190 million. income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 was $47 million and included $7 million from souriau-sunbank's operations and a gain on the sale of souriau-sunbank, net of tax, of $40 million. income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 was $51 million and included $13 million from the results of operations of souriau-sunbank and the eit group of businesses and a gain on the sale of the eit group of businesses, net of tax, of $38 million.
•net income attributable to td group. net income attributable to td group decreased $191 million, or 21.5%, to $699 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 compared to net income attributable to td group of $890 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019, primarily as a result of the factors referred to above.
•earnings per share. basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and discontinued operations were $8.14 and $0.82, respectively, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020. for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and discontinued operations were $12.94 and $0.90, respectively. net income attributable to td group for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 of $699 million was decreased by dividend equivalent payments of $185 million, or $3.22 per share, resulting in net income applicable to td group common stockholders of $514 million, or $8.96 per share. net income attributable to td group for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 of $890 million was decreased by dividend equivalent payments of $111 million, or $1.97 per share, resulting in net income applicable to td group common stockholders of $779 million, or $13.84 per share. the decrease of $4.88 per share is a result of the factors referred to above.

organic sales for the power & control segment decreased $237 million, a decrease of 8.7%, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019. the organic sales decrease resulted primarily from decreases in commercial aftermarket sales ($157 million, a decrease of 21.0%) and commercial oem sales ($145 million, a decrease of 23.0%); partially offset by an increase in defense sales ($59 million, an increase of 4.6%). the decreases in organic commercial oem and aftermarket sales are attributable to the covid-19 pandemic. the decrease in organic commercial oem sales is also attributable to the boeing 737 max production slowdown. partially offsetting the decrease in organic sales is an increase in acquisition sales of $196 million, an increase of 7.2%, as a result of the esterline acquisition.
organic sales for the airframe segment decreased $476 million, a decrease of 20.5%, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019. the organic sales decrease resulted primarily from decreases in commercial aftermarket sales ($253 million, a decrease of 29.8%), commercial oem sales ($213 million, a decrease of 26.5%) and defense sales ($8 million, a decrease of 1.3%). the decreases in organic commercial oem and aftermarket sales are attributable to the covid-19 pandemic. partially offsetting the decrease in organic sales is an increase in acquisition sales of $400 million, an increase of 17.2%, as a result of the esterline acquisition.
organic sales for the non-aviation segment decreased by $10 million, a decrease of 6.3%, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019. partially offsetting the decrease in organic sales is an increase in acquisition sales of $7 million, an increase of 4.4%, as a result of the esterline acquisition.

fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2018
for our results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, refer to the discussion in item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of form 10-k for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019, as filed with the securities and exchange commission on november 19, 2019.
backlog for information about our backlog, see item 1. "business."
foreign operations our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately $1,696 million, $1,778 million, and $1,355 million for the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including the covid-19 pandemic, foreign currency fluctuations, the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments' countries. furthermore, there can be no assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the u.s. will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy.
inflation many of the company's raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation, which could result in changing operating costs. furthermore, recently implemented changes to the u.s. and other countries' tariff and import/export regulations may have an unfavorable impact on raw materials pricing. the effects of inflation on the company's businesses during the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were immaterial.
liquidity and capital resources we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing. we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions. we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations and/or through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt.
if the company has excess cash, it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner: (1) capital spending at existing businesses, (2) acquisitions of businesses, (3) payment of a special dividend and/or repurchases of our common stock and (4) prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt. whether the company undertakes common stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions, the company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material. in addition, the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so.
the company's ability to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the company's indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on the company's ability to generate cash in the future. this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control, including the ongoing covid-19 pandemic.
the covid-19 pandemic has caused a significant adverse impact on our sales, net income and ebitda as defined for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 and is expected to continue to do so into fiscal 2021. this is under the assumption that the covid-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact customer demand for all market channels with commercial oem and commercial aftermarket being the most adversely impacted due to the pandemic's impact on air travel worldwide. the defense market channel is also impacted to a lesser extent due to certain supply chain disruptions as well as the "stay at home" orders, quarantines, etc. impacting the government procurement workforce which has slowed production and/or orders. also, government funding reprioritization such as shifting funds to efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic provides for uncertainty. the magnitude of the impact of covid-19 remains unpredictable and we, therefore, continue to anticipate potential supply chain disruptions, employee absenteeism and short-term suspensions of manufacturing facilities, and additional health and safety costs related to the covid-19 pandemic that could unfavorably impact our business. longer term, because the duration of the pandemic is unclear, it is difficult to forecast a precise impact on the company's future results.
the company is actively managing the business to maintain cash flow, including the cost mitigation efforts described in note 1, "description of the business and impact of covid-19 pandemic," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein in response to the covid-19 pandemic and is continuing to focus on the application of its three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving its cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers).
in march 2020, the president of the united states signed the cares act, a substantial tax-and-spending package intended to provide additional economic stimulus to address the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. the cares act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, and modifications to the net interest deduction limitations. the most significant impact of the cares act for the company is an increase of the irc 163(j) interest disallowance limitations from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income which will allow the company to deduct additional interest for fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
in march 2020, the company drew $200 million on its revolving credit facility to increase the company's liquidity as a precautionary response to macroeconomic conditions caused by the covid-19 pandemic. also, in further action to increase the company's liquidity, the company executed two notes offerings in april 2020 in which the proceeds received are for general corporate purposes. on april 8, 2020, the company entered into a purchase agreement in connection with a private offering of $1,100 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.00% senior secured notes due 2025 at an issue price of 100% of the principal amount. on april 17, 2020, the company entered into a purchase agreement in connection with a private offering of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior secured notes due 2026 at an issue price of 101% of the principal amount.
as of september 30, 2020, the company has significant cash liquidity as illustrated in the table presented below (in millions):
as of september 30, 2020
cash and cash equivalents                                             $4,717
availability on revolving credit facility       521
cash liquidity                                                        $5,238
we believe our significant cash liquidity will allow us to meet our anticipated funding requirements. we expect to meet our short-term cash liquidity requirements (including interest obligations and capital expenditures) through net cash from operating activities, cash on hand and, if needed, additional draws on the revolving credit facility. long-term cash liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our long-term debt agreements. there is no maturity on any tranche of term loans or notes until july 2024.
as a result of the debt financing transactions completed during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 as described in note 12, "debt," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein, interest payments will increase going forward in accordance with the terms of the related debt agreements. however, in connection with the continued application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers), we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide sufficient cash provided by operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs. we believe our cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make strategic business combinations, pay dividends to our shareholders and/or make opportunistic investments in our own stock.
in the future, the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions, if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other short-term cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends. our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets.
operating activities. the company generated $1,213 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2020 compared to $1,015 million during fiscal 2019. the change from prior year is primarily driven by changes in working capital as further described below.
the change in trade accounts receivable during fiscal 2020 was a source of $352 million in cash compared to a use of cash of $82 million in fiscal 2019. the increase in the source of cash of $434 million is primarily attributable to a decline in sales, and the related accounts receivable, in the second half of fiscal 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic. the company continues to actively manage its accounts receivable, the related agings and collection efforts.
the change in inventories during fiscal 2020 was a use of cash of $62 million compared to a use of cash of $36 million in fiscal 2019.
the change in accounts payable during fiscal 2020 was a use of cash of $62 million compared to a use of cash of $1 million in fiscal 2019. the increase in the use of cash is primarily driven by a decline in accounts payable as inventory and other purchases have slowed as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and cost mitigation measures enacted in the second half of fiscal 2020.
investing activities. net cash provided by investing activities was $799 million during fiscal 2020, consisting of proceeds of $904 million from the divestiture of souriau-sunbank (net of cash transferred with the divested entities), partially offset by capital expenditures of $105 million. the company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal year 2021 to be between $120 million and $140 million with the increase from prior year attributable to fiscal 2020 projects that were delayed into fiscal 2021 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. the company's capital expenditures incurred from year to year are primarily for projects that are consistent with our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improve our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers).
financing activities. net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 was $1,230 million. the source of cash was primarily attributable to $2,625 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 5.50% 2027 notes offering, $1,090 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 2025 secured notes offering, $399 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 6.25% 2026 new notes offering, $200 million drawn from the existing revolving credit facility and $116 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. this was partially offset by special dividend and dividend equivalent payments of $1,928 million, the redemption of the 2022 notes outstanding for $1,167 million, repayments on term loans of $75 million, the purchase of treasury stock of $19 million and other financing costs of $11 million.
description of senior secured term loans and indentures senior secured credit facilities transdigm has $7,449 million in fully drawn term loans (the "term loans facility") and a $760 million revolving credit facility. the term loans facility consists of three tranches of term loans as follows (aggregate principal amount disclosed is as of september 30, 2020):
term loans facility             aggregate principal   maturity date           interest rate tranche e                            $2,199 million   may 30, 2025            libor + 2.25%
tranche f                            $3,489 million   december 9, 2025        libor + 2.25%
tranche g                            $1,761 million   august 22, 2024         libor + 2.25%
the term loans facility requires quarterly aggregate principal payments of $18.8 million. the revolving commitments consist of two tranches which include up to $151.5 million of multicurrency revolving commitments. at september 30, 2020, the company had $39 million in letters of credit outstanding and $521 million in borrowings available under the revolving commitments.
the interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the credit agreement are, at transdigm's option, equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor for one, two, three or six-month (or to the extent agreed to by each relevant lender, nine or twelve-month) interest periods chosen by transdigm, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. the adjusted libor related to tranche e, tranche f and tranche g term loans are not subject to a floor. for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020, the applicable interest rates ranged from approximately 2.41% to 4.54% on the existing term loans. interest rate swaps and caps used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on the credit facility are described in note 21, "derivatives and hedging activities," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
recent amendments to the credit agreement on february 6, 2020, the company entered into amendment no. 7 and refinancing facility agreement (herein, "amendment no. 7"). under the terms of amendment no. 7, the company, among other things, (i) incurred new tranche e term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to approximately $2,216 million, new tranche f term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to approximately $3,515 million and new tranche g term loans, (collectively, the "new term loans") in an aggregate principal amount equal to approximately $1,774 million, (ii) repaid in full all of the existing tranche e term loans, tranche f term loans and tranche g term loans outstanding under the credit agreement immediately prior to amendment no. 7 and (iii) extended the maturity date of the tranche f term loans to december 9, 2025, (iv) modified the definition of consolidated ebitda in the credit agreement to add back certain cost savings and non-recurring cost and expenses and (v) modified certain negative covenants to provide additional flexibility to enable transdigm to incur additional debt and make additional investments and asset sales.
the new term loans were fully drawn on february 6, 2020. the libor per annum applicable to the new term loans is 2.25%, a decrease from the previous rate of 2.50%. the other terms and conditions that apply to the new term loans are substantially the same as the terms and conditions that applied to the term loans immediately prior to amendment no. 7.

certain restrictive covenants in our debt documents the credit agreement and the indentures governing the notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of special dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances, and prepayments of certain other indebtedness.
the restrictive covenants included in the credit agreement are subject to amendments executed periodically. the most recent amendment that impacted the restrictive covenants contained in the credit agreement is amendment no. 7.
under the terms of the credit agreement, transdigm is entitled, on one or more occasions, to request additional term loans or additional revolving commitments to the extent that the existing or new lenders agree to provide such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments provided that, among other conditions, our consolidated net leverage ratio would be no greater than 7.25x and the consolidated secured net debt ratio would be no greater than 5.00x, in each case, after giving effect to such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments.
if any such default occurs, the lenders under the credit agreement and the holders of the notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. the lenders under the credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. in addition, following an event of default under the credit agreement, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the notes.
with the exception of the revolving credit facility, the company has no maintenance covenants in its existing term loan and indenture agreements. under the credit agreement, if the usage of the revolving credit facility exceeds 35%, or $266 million, of the total revolving commitments, the company is required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt to trailing four-quarter ebitda as defined of 7.25x as of the last day of the fiscal quarter.
as of september 30, 2020, the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants in subsequent periods.
trade receivables securitization during fiscal 2014, the company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the "securitization facility"). the securitization facility effectively increases the company's borrowing capacity depending on the amount of the domestic operations' trade accounts receivable. the securitization facility includes the right for the company to exercise annual one year extensions as long as there have been no termination events as defined by the agreement. the company uses the proceeds from the securitization facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs.
on july 22, 2020, the company amended the securitization facility to extend the maturity date to july 27, 2021. as of september 30, 2020, the company has borrowed $350 million under the securitization facility, which bears interest at a rate of 1.35% plus 0.50% or libor, whichever is greater. at september 30, 2020, the applicable interest rate was 1.85%. the securitization facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company's domestic operations' trade accounts receivable.
dividend and dividend equivalent payments on january 7, 2020 and august 23, 2019, the company paid a special cash dividends of $32.50 and $30.00, respectively, on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on options granted under its stock incentive plans. the total cash payments related to the special dividend and dividend equivalent payments in fiscal 2020 and 2019 were approximately $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.
we do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. any declaration of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions under the senior secured credit facility and indentures, the availability of surplus under delaware law and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. td group is a holding company and conducts all of its operations through direct and indirect subsidiaries. unless td group receives dividends, distributions, advances, transfers of funds or other payments from our subsidiaries, td group will be unable to pay any dividends on our common stock in the future. the ability of any subsidiaries to take any of the foregoing actions is limited by the terms of our senior secured credit facility and indentures and may be limited by future debt or other agreements that we may enter into.
stock repurchase program on november 8, 2017, our board of directors, authorized a stock repurchase program permitting repurchases of our outstanding shares not to exceed $650 million in the aggregate, subject to any restrictions specified in the credit agreement and/or indentures governing the existing notes.
during march 2020, the company repurchased 36,900 shares of its common stock at a gross cost of $18.9 million at the weighted average cost of $512.67 under the $650 million stock repurchase program. as of september 30, 2020, the remaining amount of repurchases allowable under the $650 million program was $631.1 million subject to any restrictions specified in the credit agreement and/or indentures governing the existing notes.

item 1a.    risk factors in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. these risks, some of which have occurred and/or are occurring and any of which could occur in the future, are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.
business and industry risks we face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
we operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70% of our net sales originating in markets outside the u.s. while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:
•changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-u.s. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in u.s. dollars, in those markets;
•exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product, including as a result of covid-19, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;
•political or economic instability, geopolitical events, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as covid-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;
•changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of volatile commodity prices, including the price of oil;
•lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights;
•foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and
•changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in onerous trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, including as a result of covid-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, profit controls or other government controls.
any or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.
in addition, the impact of the united kingdom's exit from the european union (commonly referred to as brexit) continues to be unclear. brexit continues to pose legal, political and economic uncertainty, which could subject us to heightened risks in the region, including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the united kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and disruptions to our workforce and that of our suppliers and business partners. we do not, however, believe brexit has had or will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
furthermore, the imposition of tariffs and/or increase in tariffs on various products by the united states and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries and new and/or increased tariffs have subjected, and may continue in the future to subject, us to additional costs and expenditure of resources. major developments in trade relations, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the united states and/or other countries, and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which, in turn, could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of selling price increases, where permitted, sourcing strategies, cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. however, the impact of these measures may not fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.
we face vigorous competition worldwide, including from strong local competitors and from other large, multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. in addition, the substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models.
we face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new product introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on or have more effective advertising and promotional activities than we do, introduce competing products more quickly and/or respond more effectively to business and economic conditions and changing consumer preferences, including by launching innovative new products. such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising. our success is increasingly dependent on our ability to effectively leverage digital technology and data analytics to gain new commercial insights and develop relevant marketing and advertising to reach customers and consumers. in addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience increased demand for many of our products in response to covid-19. as a result, we have seen and expect to continue to see heightened competitive activity from our competitors in certain of our categories, including more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges and the marketing of new products in high demand categories. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property, including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and trade dress rights, against infringement and legal challenges by competitors.
we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them, which could harm our business. in addition, the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may affect our performance. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retail landscape may adversely affect our business.
our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and ecommerce retailers. with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, the rapid growth of ecommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers, we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers, and some of these retailers have and may continue to have greater bargaining strength than we do. they have used and may continue to use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances, slotting fees or increased investment, including through display media, paid search, preparation fees and co-op programs, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for additional information regarding our customers, see "distribution; raw materials; competition; trademarks and patents" in item 1 "business."
we also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, or environmental, sustainability, supply chain or packaging initiatives and other conditions. for example, a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or that our packaging does not comply with certain environmental, supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in addition, "private label" products sold by our retail customers, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our products. in addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-customer businesses. the rapid growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. if we are not successful in continuing to adapt or effectively react to changes in consumer preferences, purchasing patterns and market dynamics and/or expanding sales through ecommerce retailers and other alternative retail channels, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.
the growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products.
our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies. our ability to launch new products, to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully:
•identify, develop and fund technological innovations;
•obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others;
•obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the fda and other regulatory bodies in the u.s. and abroad; and
•anticipate and quickly respond to the needs and preferences of consumers and customers.
the identification, development and introduction of innovative new products that drive incremental sales involves considerable costs and effort, and any new product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising. in addition, new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace.
our ability to quickly innovate and to adapt and market our products to meet evolving consumer preferences and to adapt our packaging to meet evolving customer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy. the failure to develop and launch successful new products or to adapt our packaging and supply chain to meet such preferences could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
if, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even if we are not found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products.
we face various risks related to pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
we face various risks related to pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns, including the covid-19 pandemic. a pandemic, epidemic or similar widespread health concern could have, and covid-19 has had and will continue to have, a variety of impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:
•our ability to continue to maintain and support the health, safety and well-being of our employees, including key employees;
•volatility in the demand for and availability of our products, which may be caused by the temporary inability of our consumers to purchase our products due to illness, financial hardship, quarantine, government actions mandating the closure of our distributors or retailers or imposing travel or movement restrictions, shifts in demand and consumption away from more discretionary or higher priced products to lower-priced products or pantry-loading activity;
•substantial increases in demand for certain of our products requiring us to increase our production capacity or acquire additional capacity at an additional cost and expense;
•changes in purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the frequency of in-store visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift to purchasing our products online from ecommerce retailers;
•disruptions to our global supply chain, including the closure of manufacturing and distribution facilities, due to, among other things, the availability of raw and packaging materials or manufacturing components; a decrease in our workforce or in the efficiency of such workforce, including as a result of illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism or governmental regulations; transportation and logistics challenges, including as a result of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions or reduced shipping capacity; or the impact of covid-19 on our retailers, third party suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers or distributors;
•failure of third parties on which we rely, including our retailers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, customers, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties;
•significant changes in the economic and political conditions of the markets in which we operate, which could restrict and have restricted our employees' ability to work and travel, could mandate and have mandated or caused the closure of certain distributors or retailers, our offices, shared business service centers and/or operating and manufacturing facilities or otherwise could prevent and have prevented us as well as our third-party partners, suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the manufacture, distribution, sale and support of our products;
•disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets, which may increase the cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital; and/or
•volatility in foreign exchange rates and in raw and packaging materials and logistics costs.
despite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration, severity and geographic scope of an outbreak, such as covid-19, the availability, widespread distribution and use of safe and effective vaccines and the actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health and economic effects.
damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.
maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our ethics and compliance, diversity, equity and inclusion, sustainability and social impact, brand protection and product safety, regulatory and quality initiatives. negative publicity about us, our brands, our products, our supply chain, our ingredients, our packaging, our environmental, social and governance practices, including as they relate to diversity, equity and inclusion, or our employees, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. such negative publicity could relate to, among other things, health concerns, threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings, environmental impacts (including deforestation, packaging, plastic, energy and water use and waste management), our environmental, social and governance practices, or other sustainability or policy issues. in addition, widespread use of digital and social media by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination. negative publicity, posts or comments on social media about us, our brands, our products, our packaging or our employees, whether true or untrue, could damage our brands and our reputation. the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers.
additionally, due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions. while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, compliance and environmental, social and governance practices, thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk.
in addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. as a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.
our success depends upon our ability to recruit, attract and retain key employees, including through the implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and the succession of senior management.
our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. if we are unable to recruit, attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the company and succession plans for senior management, is critical to our business success. while we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time. further, changes in immigration laws and policies, including during the covid-19 pandemic, have made in certain circumstances and may continue to make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. in addition, we are working to advance culture change through the implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives throughout our organization. if we do not (or are perceived not to) successfully implement these initiatives, our ability to recruit, attract and retain talent may be adversely impacted.
we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures, which could adversely impact our business.
we have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands, businesses or technologies from third parties. acquisitions and their pursuit involve numerous potential risks, including, among other things:
•realizing the full extent of the expected benefits or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all;
•successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of the acquired brands or businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner;
•receiving necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction;
•diverting management's attention from other business priorities;
•successfully operating in new lines of business, channels of distribution or markets;
•retaining key employees, partners, suppliers and customers of the acquired business;
•conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies of the acquired business with our own;
•developing or launching products with acquired technologies; and
•other unanticipated problems or liabilities.
moreover, acquisitions have resulted in and could in the future result in substantial additional debt, exposure to contingent liabilities, such as litigation or earn-out obligations, the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or transaction costs. any of these risks, should they materialize, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
we have divested and may in the future periodically divest brands or businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. in addition, businesses under consideration for, or otherwise subject to, divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
operational risks our business results are impacted by our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities.
we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. our operations and those of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or logistics providers have been and may continue to be disrupted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:
•environmental events;
•widespread health emergencies, such as covid-19 or other pandemics or epidemics;
•strikes and other labor disputes;
•disruptions in logistics;
•loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites;
•loss of key suppliers or contract manufacturers;
•supplier capacity constraints;
•raw material and product quality or safety issues;
•industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues;
•the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets;
•the lack of availability of qualified personnel, such as truck drivers;
•governmental incentives and controls (including import and export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); and
•natural disasters, including climatic events (including any potential effect of climate change) and earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or uncertainty, fires or explosions, cyber-security incidents and other external factors over which we have no control.
in addition, we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time.
we believe that the supplies of raw and packaging materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate. in addition, we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers and the supply of raw and packaging materials. nonetheless, a significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason, including those mentioned above, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
in addition, as a result of our global shared service organizational model, certain of our functions, such as marketing, payroll, finance and accounting, customer service and logistics, and human resources, are concentrated in key office facilities. a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including those mentioned above, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability.
raw and packaging material commodities, such as essential oils, resins, pulp, tropical oils, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. increases in the costs of and/or a reduction in the availability of commodities, energy and logistics and other necessary services, including during the covid-19 pandemic, have affected and may continue to adversely affect our profit margins. if commodity and other cost increases continue in the future and we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases, achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted. in addition, even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain the price increases. also, sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. see "our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities" above for additional information.
there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.
one way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things. the achievement of our funding-the-growth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected. any failure to implement our funding-the-growth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for additional information regarding our funding-the-growth initiatives, refer to part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive overview."
a cyber-security incident, data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business.
we rely extensively on information technology systems ("it systems"), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to:
•communicating within our company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers;
•ordering and managing materials from suppliers;
•converting materials to finished products;
•receiving and processing orders from, shipping products to and invoicing our customers and consumers;
•marketing products to consumers;
•collecting, storing, transferring and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, including, but not limited to, such data from residents of the european union who are covered by the general data protection regulation, which went into effect on may 25, 2018, and residents of the state of california who are covered by the california consumer privacy act of 2018, which went into effect on january 1, 2020;
•processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers and vendors;
•hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, intellectual property, business plans and financial information;
•summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting;
•managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms;
•complying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements;
•providing data security; and
•handling other processes involved in managing our business.
although we have a broad array of information security measures in place, our it systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups, individuals and nation states with a wide range of expertise and motives. such cyber-attacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails. we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers', it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. in addition, although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by us or our third-party service providers is securely maintained, data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur. furthermore, we periodically upgrade our it systems or adopt new technologies. if such an upgrade or new technology does not function as designed, does not go as planned or increases our exposure to a cyber-attack or cyber incident, it may adversely impact our business, including our ability to ship products to customers, issue invoices and process payments or order raw and packaging materials. although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cyber-security attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date, if we suffer a significant loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our it systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, or otherwise, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
furthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our it systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events and, if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm, and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation, any of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
climate change and other sustainability matters may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
it has been reported that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. the predicted effects of climate change may also exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water and other ingredients. in addition, concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. despite our sustainability efforts, any failure to achieve our sustainability goals, including those aimed to reduce our impact on, improve or preserve the environment, or the perception (whether or not valid) that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change, could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation. there is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers, consumers, our employees and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including single-use and other plastic packaging and ingredient transparency. our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
legal and regulatory risks our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the u.s. and abroad.
our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the u.s. and abroad. such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, packaging content, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising, sale and environmental impact. u.s. federal authorities, including the u.s. food and drug administration (the "fda"), the federal trade commission, the consumer product safety commission, the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. in addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the u.s. and abroad.
new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities around the world review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products. while we monitor and seek to mitigate the impact of any emerging information, a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging. additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients, to obtain regulatory approval of such products or ingredients on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business.
because of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide anti-bribery laws, including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and laws that prohibit commercial bribery. while our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the cost of responding to such a claim, including management time and out-of-pocket expenses, and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation, brand image and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see item 3 "legal proceedings" and note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.
legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business.
as a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, we are and may continue to be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings, including disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, data privacy and security, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. in addition, if one of our products, or an ingredient contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective, or unsafe or have a quality issue, we have had to and may in the future need to withdraw, recall or reformulate some of our products. whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful, or a withdrawal, recall or reformulation is required or advisable, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. the resolution of, or increase in the reserves taken in connection with, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for that period. see item 3 "legal proceedings" and note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings.
financial and economic risks uncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions, including as a result of covid-19, may adversely affect our business.
uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable global economic conditions, such as a recession, economic slowdown and/or reduced category growth rates, including as a result of covid-19, could negatively impact our business and result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flows. although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, during periods of economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions, consumers may reduce consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to "private label" or lower-priced brands. these changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. additionally, our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins. furthermore, economic conditions can cause our suppliers, distributors, contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties, which may impact their inability to provide us with or distribute finished product, raw and packaging materials and/or services in a timely manner or at all. in addition, we could face difficulty collecting or recovering accounts receivables from third parties facing financial or operational difficulties.
disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.
while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption in the credit markets, interest rate increases, changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace the london interbank offered rate (libor) or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding. reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. in addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper programs or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate, foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate, foreign currency or commodity price exposures. in addition, tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could negatively impact our business.
we are subject to taxes in the u.s. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we do business. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change. changes in the mix of our earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in tax rates, changes in tax laws, including how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or contemplated changes in long-standing tax principles, if finalized and adopted, could adversely impact our future effective tax rate and business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for example, long-standing international tax norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements ("beps") recommended by countries that then made up the g8 and the g20 and the organization for economic cooperation and development. in connection with beps, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in countries outside of the u.s. as this and other tax laws and related regulations change, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially impacted. for more information regarding u.s. tax reform, see note 11, income taxes to the consolidated financial statements.
furthermore, we are subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the u.s. although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we have faced and in the future may face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, in excess of reserves. the payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview business organization colgate-palmolive company (together with its subsidiaries, "we," "us" "our" the "company" or "colgate") is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. we seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as to provide colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. we do this by developing and selling products globally that make people's lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion strategies across our organization.
we are tightly focused on two product segments: oral, personal and home care; and pet nutrition. within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.
operationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. we compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. approximately 70% of our net sales are generated from markets outside the u.s., with approximately 45% of our net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of latin america, asia (excluding japan), africa/eurasia and central europe). this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.
the oral, personal and home care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: north america, latin america, europe, asia pacific and africa/eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and ecommerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors. through hill's pet nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and ecommerce retailers. we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.
on an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. these indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-gaap financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a gaap and non-gaap basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. in addition, we review market share data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. the monitoring of these indicators and our code of conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. for additional information regarding non-gaap financial measures and the company's use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see "non-gaap financial measures" and "market share information" below.

covid-19
the covid-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid-19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop and have significantly impacted and will likely continue to impact economic activity around the world. we have a well-established crisis management team ("cmt") process, and the cmt, together with our senior management team and colgate people around the world, continue to respond to and manage the challenges presented by covid-19.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced unprecedented "stay at home" orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid-19, and have implemented varying policies to resume economic activity. the situation continues to be uncertain and varies by geography, as infection rates of covid-19 continue to increase in many regions throughout the world, and authorities have taken different approaches to address the pandemic and resume economic activity. because the vast majority of our products (such as oral care products, soaps and other personal hygiene products, home cleaners and pet food) have been deemed essential for the health and well-being of people and their pets, we have, in most instances, been able to continue operating our business.
in doing so, the health, safety and well-being of our employees has been and remains our first priority. many of our employees globally continue to work from home. in those instances where our employees cannot perform their work at home, such as in our factories and in certain of our laboratories, or in geographies where circumstances have allowed us to offer employees the ability to return to the office, often on a voluntary and staggered basis, we have implemented additional health and safety measures and social distancing protocols, consistent with government recommendations and/or requirements, to help to ensure their safety, often at an additional cost. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2020, we experienced some limited factory closures and, in some cases, we have seen increased instances of absenteeism. furthermore, some of our suppliers, customers, distributors, logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses.
we saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories in the year ended december 31, 2020, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners, driven by consumer pantry-loading and increased consumption of our products. we believe that some of the increase in consumption in these categories is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to covid-19. in other categories, such as oral care and pet food, consumer demand trends continued to normalize in the second half of the year ended december 31, 2020. across our business, changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category and geography depending on, among other things, the severity of the covid-19 outbreak and retailer availability. at the same time, during the year ended december 31, 2020, we experienced declines in certain channels, including professional sales and travel retail, due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movement in many geographies throughout the world. we also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online. in some instances during the year ended december 31, 2020, we were not able to keep up with the increased consumer demand for our products, and our products were at times out of stock on retailers' shelves. in some cases, we have incurred additional costs as we worked to meet this increased demand. despite continuing to significantly ramp up production of in-demand products, we expect that some of our products may continue to be out of stock on retailers' shelves for a period of time.
covid-19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of covid-19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers' ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. while we believe that, in the long-term, consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong, uncertainties continue surrounding the timing and extent of the pandemic and the recovery from it. these uncertainties include: the impact of the timing and scale of changes to travel and movement restrictions in certain geographies, the availability and widespread distribution and use of safe and effective covid-19 vaccines and when communities will reach herd immunity, the timing and impact of consumer pantry-loading and destocking activity in certain markets, product demand trends and the impact of covid-19 on the global economy. our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties are also being impacted by the global pandemic; their success in addressing covid-19 and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to and sales of our products. we expect the ongoing economic impact and health concerns associated with covid-19 to continue to impact consumer behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences despite the lifting of government restrictions and the reopening of economies around the world.
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
while we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above and we intend to continue to work with government authorities and to follow the necessary protocols to maintain the health and safety of our employees and contract providers, uncertainty resulting from covid-19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs.
for more information about the anticipated covid-19 impact, see "outlook" below.
business strategy to achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on innovating our core businesses; improving our brand building activities with an elevated brand purpose model and the use of equity advertising; innovating to gain market share in high growth segments and adjacencies; expanding into new channels and markets; maximizing growth online; and investing to drive consumption in growing populations. we continue to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and ecommerce retailers. in addition, we continue to invest behind our brands, not just in terms of advertising, but also to build key growth capabilities in areas such as innovation and data and analytics. we also continue to broaden our ecommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. we continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products. we are also working to integrate our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion strategies across our organization.
we are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. the retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.
the investments needed to drive growth are supported by strong cash flow performance and our disciplined capital allocation strategy. these investments are developed through continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through sku reductions and formulation simplification. we also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our oral care, personal care and pet nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health.
significant items impacting comparability on january 31, 2020, we acquired hello products llc ("hello"), an oral care business, for cash consideration of $351. the acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash. this acquisition is part of our strategy to focus on high growth segments within our oral care, personal care and pet nutrition businesses. see note 3, acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2020 includes $71 of income tax benefits, of which $45 relates to previously recorded foreign withholding taxes and $26 relates to a previously recorded valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. as described more fully in "results of operations-income taxes," below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja").

our restructuring program, known as the "global growth and efficiency program," concluded on december 31, 2019. initiatives under the global growth and efficiency program fit within the program's three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we adjusted the accrual balances related to certain projects approved prior to the conclusion of the global growth and efficiency program to reflect our revised estimate of remaining liabilities, which resulted in a reduction of $16 ($13 aftertax) to restructuring accruals. no new restructuring projects were approved for implementation during the year ended december 31, 2020. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we incurred costs of $132 ($102 aftertax) resulting from the global growth and efficiency program. for more information regarding the global growth and efficiency program, see "restructuring and related implementation charges" below and note 4, restructuring and related implementation charges to the consolidated financial statements.
in december 2019, the swiss government enacted changes to its corporate tax regime, which included, among other items, the repeal of certain preferential tax regimes and an increase to the cantonal tax rate for future periods. additionally, the government provided transition rules which allowed companies to record goodwill for tax purposes, partially offsetting the impact on cash taxes of the higher cantonal rate over the next ten years. as a result of these changes, we recorded a net benefit of $29 to the provision for income taxes.
in september 2019, we acquired laboratoires filorga cosmétiques s.a. ("filorga"), a skin health business, for cash consideration of €1,548 (approximately $1,712). in the third quarter of 2020, we completed the purchase of the outstanding non-controlling interest of filorga's joint venture based in hong kong and covering the hong kong and china markets for approximately €85 (approximately $99) in cash. see note 3, acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in 2019, we received a favorable judgment regarding certain value-added tax previously paid in brazil. as a result of the favorable judgment, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we filed an application with the brazilian government to recover value-added tax previously paid and recorded a benefit of $30 pretax ($20 aftertax). the recovery will be utilized to offset corporate income tax payments in brazil in future periods.

outlook looking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, especially due to covid-19. during the covid-19 pandemic, we have seen improvement in category growth rates due to heightened demand for certain health and hygiene products, particularly liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners. we believe some of this increased consumption is sustainable due to consumer behavior changes resulting from covid-19. however, we expect increased volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates over the next six to twelve months. in the longer term, we expect category growth rates to remain below historical levels.
while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. we have seen increases in promotional activities in certain markets as retailers try aggressively to get consumers back into the stores after prolonged "stay at home" and other government restrictions ease, a trend we expect will continue. we have been negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers in key markets, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products or sustainability, supply chain or packaging initiatives. in addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. these trends have been magnified due to covid-19 in many of our geographies and we plan to continue to invest behind our ecommerce capabilities. this rapid growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. in certain markets, we have incurred and are likely to continue to incur increased logistics costs due to higher ecommerce demand and volume and capacity constraints in the shipping and logistics industry. in addition, given that approximately 70% of our net sales originate in markets outside the u.s., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience increasingly volatile foreign currency fluctuations and higher raw and packaging material costs. while we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, in the current environment, it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results.
as discussed above, we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid-19 on our business. while we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of covid-19, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of covid-19's impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. for more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to covid-19, see "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this annual report.
in summary, we believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, broad based experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain and focused business strategy. our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth through innovation within our core businesses, leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories and expanding in high growth channels and markets; delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency; and maximizing the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs; and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through covid-19 and increase shareholder value over time.

(1) the income tax effect on non-gaap items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-gaap adjustment.
(2) the impact of non-gaap items on the company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-gaap adjustment on income before income taxes and provision for income taxes.
the provision for income taxes for 2020 includes $71 of income tax benefits, of which $45 relates to previously recorded foreign withholding taxes and $26 relates to a previously recorded valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. as described more fully below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded by the company in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the tcja.
as part of the previously recorded charge for the tcja, the company had provided for foreign withholding taxes expected to be paid on the remittance of earnings from certain overseas subsidiaries no longer deemed indefinitely reinvested. as a result of a reorganization of the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries, the company determined that no withholding taxes will be due on the remittance by certain subsidiaries of earnings previously deemed reinvested and, accordingly, reversed $45 of previously recorded foreign withholding taxes in the first quarter of 2020.
also as part of the previously recorded charge for the tcja, the company provided a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to foreign tax credit carry-forwards that the company did not expect to be able to use due to changes made by the tcja. as a result of a new operating structure implemented within one of the company's divisions, the company believes the use of these foreign tax credit carry-forwards will not be limited in the future and, accordingly, reversed the previously recorded valuation allowance of $26 in the first quarter of 2020.
the effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the company's global business initiatives.

the increase in organic sales in 2020 versus 2019 was due to organic sales growth in the science diet and prescription diet categories.
operating profit in hill's pet nutrition increased 13% in 2020 to $793, while as a percentage of net sales it decreased 30 bps to 27.5%. this decrease in operating profit as a percentage of net sales was due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (90 bps) and an increase in other (income) expense, net (30 bps), partially offset by an increase in gross profit (90 bps), all as a percentage of net sales. this increase in gross profit was primarily due to cost savings from the company's funding-the-growth initiatives (140 bps) and higher pricing, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (170 bps). this increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (270 bps), partially offset by lower overhead expenses (180 bps). this increase in other (income) expense, net was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the voluntary recall for which hill's was not indemnified.
during the quarter ended march 31, 2019, hill's announced a voluntary recall, which was subsequently expanded, of select canned dog food products due to potentially elevated levels of vitamin d resulting from a supplier error. in the united states, the voluntary recall was conducted in cooperation with the u.s. food and drug administration. following the announcement of the voluntary recall, and as of december 31, 2020, hill's and/or the company have been named as defendants in 37 putative class action lawsuits, one putative class action filed on behalf of a european union class and one individual action, all related to the voluntary recall and filed in various jurisdictions in the united states. in addition, two putative class actions related to the voluntary recall have been filed in canada. eight of the putative class actions lawsuits in the united states and one of the putative class action lawsuits in canada have been voluntarily dismissed. during the quarter ended december 31, 2020, the parties to the putative class action lawsuits in the united states (other than the class action filed on behalf of a european union class) entered into a settlement agreement, which was preliminarily approved by the court in february 2021. the amount of the settlement is not material to the company's results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020. hill's is indemnified by the supplier related to the voluntary recall. sales of products voluntarily recalled represent less than 2% of hill's annual net sales. the sales loss and other costs associated with the voluntary recall and its subsequent expansion did not have a material impact on the company's net sales or operating profit for the year ended december 31, 2020 and are not expected to have a material impact in future periods.

non-gaap financial measures this annual report on form 10-k discusses certain financial measures on both a gaap and a non-gaap basis. the company uses the non-gaap financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the company's underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, these non-gaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.
net sales growth (gaap) and organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-gaap) are discussed in this annual report on form 10-k. management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the company's underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, as applicable. a reconciliation of organic sales growth to net sales growth for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 is provided below.

market share information management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. references to market share in this annual report on form 10-k are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily nielsen, and internal estimates. all market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the company competes and purchases data (excluding venezuela from all periods).
market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. in particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as ecommerce or certain discounters. the company measures year-to-date market shares from january 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. the company believes that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. in certain limited circumstances, the covid-19 pandemic has impacted the ability of our third-party vendors to provide the company with reliable updated market share data. in addition, market share information calculated by the company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.

liquidity and capital resources the company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions). the company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.
cash flow net cash provided by operations increased to $3,719 in 2020 as compared to $3,133 in 2019, primarily due to changes in working capital, higher net income and lower voluntary contributions to the company's pension plans, which were partially offset by higher income tax payments. the company's working capital as a percentage of net sales was (4.4)% in 2020 and (1.6)% in 2019. this change in working capital as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to higher accrued liabilities, higher accounts payable and higher accrued income taxes, partially offset by an increase in inventory. the company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt).
investing activities used $779 of cash in 2020 compared to $2,099 during 2019. as more fully described below, investing activities in 2020 include the company's acquisition of hello. investing activities in 2019 include the company's acquisition of filorga and the nigeria joint venture. purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2020 to $143 from $184 in 2019. proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2020 to $124 from $131 in 2019.
capital expenditures in the year ended december 31, 2020 were $410, an increase from $335 in 2019. capital expenditures increased in 2020 primarily due to capacity expansion of manufacturing facilities and sustainability projects. capital expenditures for 2021 are expected to be approximately 3.0% to 3.5% of net sales. the company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns.
on january 31, 2020, the company acquired hello for cash consideration of $351 as part of the company's continued strategy to focus on the high growth segments within its oral care, personal care and pet nutrition businesses. on september 19, 2019, the company acquired filorga for cash consideration of €1,516 (approximately $1,674) plus additional consideration of €32 (approximately $38), the majority of which related to repayment of loans from former shareholders of filorga. in july 2020, the company completed the purchase of the outstanding non-controlling interest of filorga's joint venture based in hong kong and covering the hong kong and china markets for approximately €85 (approximately $99) in cash. on august 15, 2019, the company acquired a 51% controlling interest in the nigeria joint venture for $31.
these acquisitions were financed with a combination of debt and cash. as a result of the incremental debt related to these acquisitions, in accordance with the company's previously announced intention to moderate share repurchases, net of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, the company continued to moderate its share repurchases, net in 2020. in addition, due to the initial uncertainties resulting from the covid-19 pandemic and our intent to preserve cash, the company discontinued all share repurchases other than those pursuant to equity plans during the second quarter of 2020. the company resumed its moderated share repurchases, net in the third quarter of 2020. we expect share repurchases, net to return to historical levels in 2021.
financing activities used $2,919 of cash during 2020 compared to $870 during 2019. the increase in cash used was primarily due to net payments on debt in 2020 as compared to net proceeds from the issuance of debt in 2019.
long-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $7,343 as of december 31, 2020, as compared to $7,587 as of december 31, 2019, and total debt decreased to $7,601 as of december 31, 2020 as compared to $7,847 as of december 31, 2019. the company's debt issuances and redemptions support the company's capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.

_______
(1)the company classifies commercial paper and notes maturing within the next 12 months as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. the amounts in this table exclude such obligations.
(2)includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management's best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.
(3)the company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2020 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. these purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.
long-term liabilities associated with the company's postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in "critical accounting policies and use of estimates" below) and voluntary company contributions. based on current information, the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified u.s. pension plan in 2021. the company does not expect to make any voluntary contributions to its u.s. postretirement plans in 2021. in addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31, 2021 from the company's assets are estimated to be approximately $90.
additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. see note 11, income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
as more fully described in part i, item 3 "legal proceedings" and note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, the company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.

off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
managing foreign currency, interest rate, commodity price and credit risk exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the company's treasury and risk management policies. the company's treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.
the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies and note 7, fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.
foreign exchange risk as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. see "results of operations" above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment.
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. income and expense items are translated into u.s. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.
the company's foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $11 and $6 at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. at the end of 2020, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $96.

interest rate risk the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. the company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. the notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.
based on year-end 2020 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased interest (income) expense, net by $15 in 2020.
the company is assessing the impact of the discontinuation of libor as a benchmark interest rate on its current financial instruments and contractual arrangements, including debt outstanding, and believes it will not be material as the company does not have significant exposure to libor in either its debt or other financing arrangements. the company will continue to monitor its exposure in subsequent periods.
commodity price risk the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as essential oils, resins, pulp, tropical oils, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans. the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the hill's pet nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.
the company's open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $3 and $0 at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. at the end of 2020, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized gain of $1.
credit risk the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company's policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates. the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. the company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors.
in certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. the company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.
▪the company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method (75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method (25% of inventories). there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2020 or 2019 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method.
▪shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. the company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. accordingly, the company's gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. if such costs had been included as a component of cost of sales, the company's gross profit margin would have been lower by 845 bps in 2020 and by 810 bps in both 2019 and 2018, with no impact on reported earnings.
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves.
▪in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for u.s. defined benefit plans was 2.65% and 3.40% as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other u.s. postretirement plans was 2.88%, and 3.56% as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. discount rates used for the u.s. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for u.s. plans was 5.70% as of december 31, 2020 and 6.30% as of 2019. in determining the expected long-term rate of return, the company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rate of return.
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
average annual rates of return for the u.s. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 15%, 9%, 8%, 7% and 7%, respectively. in addition, the current assumed rate of return for the u.s. plans is based upon the nature of the plans' investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 74% in fixed income securities, 21% in equity securities and 5% in real estate and other investments. a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $19. a 1% change in the discount rate for the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $3. a third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return. this rate was 3.50% as of december 31, 2020, and 2019. refer to note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's pension and other postretirement plans.
▪the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits (other than the discount rate noted above) is the medical cost trend rate. the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. the assumed rate of increase for the u.s. postretirement benefit plans is 6.00% for 2021, declining to 4.75% by 2026 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. the effect on the total of service cost and interest costs components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by $10.
▪the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. the company uses the black-scholes-merton ("black-scholes") option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. the weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31, 2020 was $11.26. the black-scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. while these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. a one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 4%. a 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%. the company uses a monte-carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the date of grant. the monte-carlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the black-scholes model.
▪goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. in assessing impairment, the company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.
determining the fair value of the company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. when a quantitative analysis is performed, the company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate. estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, category growth rates, product pricing, consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations. in selecting an appropriate royalty rate, the company considers recent market transactions for similar brands and products. in determining an appropriate discount rate, the company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. other qualitative factors the company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. the company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
in determining the fair value of the company's reporting units, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. as multiple valuation methodologies are used, the company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results.
determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share, brand history, future expansion expectations, the level of in-market support anticipated by management, legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold.
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, in the first quarter of 2020, the company assessed whether a "triggering event" had occurred indicating a possible impairment of its goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets. as a result of this assessment, the company determined that a "triggering event" had occurred relative to its recently acquired filorga skin health business and, as required, performed a quantitative analysis, with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm, of the value of the filorga reporting unit and its indefinite-life intangible assets. based on the analysis, the company determined that the fair value of the filorga reporting unit and the related indefinite-life intangible assets continued to exceed their carrying values and were not impaired.
as of the date of the annual goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the filorga reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. either a reduction in the long-term growth rate of 50 basis points or an increase in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in the fair value of the filorga reporting unit exceeding its carrying value by less than 5%. as of the date of the annual impairment test, the fair value of the filorga indefinite-life intangible assets exceeded their carrying value by less than 10%. either a reduction in the long-term growth rate of 50 basis points or an increase in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in the fair value of the filorga indefinite-life intangible assets approximating their carrying value. given the inherent uncertainties in estimating the future impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on global macroeconomic conditions and interest rates in general and on the filorga business in particular, actual results may differ from management's current estimates and could have an adverse impact on one or more of the assumptions used in our quantitative models related to the filorga reporting unit and the related indefinite-life intangible assets, resulting in potential impairment charges in subsequent periods. given the recent acquisition of filorga, where there is inherently a lower surplus of fair value over carrying value, management will continue to assess triggering events that may necessitate additional qualitative or quantitative analyses of our reporting units and indefinite-life intangible assets in future periods.
except for the recently acquired filorga business, as described above, where there is inherently a lower surplus of fair value over carrying value, the estimated fair value of the company's reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. the fair value of the company's indefinite-life intangible assets other than filorga exceeds their recorded carrying value by at least 20%. therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets.
▪the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.
▪tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.
▪legal and other contingency reserves are based on management's assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. while it is possible that the company's cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the company's financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. refer to note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's contingencies.

the company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. refer to note 2, summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company's significant accounting policies.

item 1a.  risk factors the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the company's forward-looking statements. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
regulatory, legislative and legal new legislation or regulatory changes could impact the company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.
legislation passed by congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the president of the united states could significantly affect the revenues, costs, including income taxes, and profitability of the company's business. in addition, statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the company's profitability.
government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the company's operations and financial results.
the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the stb, fra, phmsa, tsa, epa and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. new or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.
csxt, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the company to significant costs and claims.
a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. under federal regulations, csxt is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.
csxt is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. in november 2008, the tsa issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.

csx corporation part i the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
as part of its railroad and other operations, the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. although the company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. additionally, the company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the company's reserve estimates.
operational, safety and business disruption an epidemic or pandemic, including the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, and the initiatives to reduce its transmission could adversely affect the company's business.
the company could be materially and adversely affected by a public health crisis, including a widespread epidemic or pandemic. as covid-19 has spread globally, including significant impacts in the united states, csx continues to take a variety of measures to ensure the availability of its transportation services, promote the safety and security of its employees and support the communities in which it operates. however, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid-19, such as closures of businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions could continue to adversely affect demand for the commodities and products that the company transports, including import and export volume.
in addition, covid-19 and the related initiatives to reduce transmission may result in greater supply chain disruption, which could continue to have an adverse impact on volumes and make it more difficult for the company to serve its customers. the extent to which this coronavirus impacts operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of this coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. moreover, operations could be negatively affected if a significant number of employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. to the extent covid-19 adversely affects the company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described under part i, item 1a (risk factors) of this annual report on form 10-k.
the company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.
the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. the performance and reliability of the company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. a cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties. such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the company's infrastructure. insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages. a disruption or compromise of the company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.9
csx corporation part i network constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency.
csxt could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) unpredictable increases in demand; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) extreme weather conditions; (iv) impacts from changes in yard capacity, or network structure or composition, including train routes; (v) increased passenger activities; or (vi) regulatory changes impacting where and how fast csxt can transport freight or maintain routes, which could impact csxt's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.
future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the company's operations.
terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. csxt's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. in addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available.
furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. for example, the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.
severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.
the company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. as a result, the company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. in addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.10
csx corporation part i competitive, economic and financial the company faces competition from other transportation providers.
the company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the company's competitive position. additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the company operates.
global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.
a decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the company's cost structure and profitability. for example, slower rates of economic growth in asia, contraction of european economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on u.s. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for csx. additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
changing dynamics in the u.s. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.
increases in production and source locations of natural gas in the u.s. have resulted in lower natural gas prices in csx's service territory. as a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. if natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. additionally, crude oil prices combined with changes in pipeline capacity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production, which has affected crude oil volumes for csx.
weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company's access to capital.
the company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the company's financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. a significant deterioration of the company's financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.11
csx corporation part i climate change and environmental the company's operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change.
there is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the company's operational territory, which could impact the company's network or other assets. climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. in particular, the epa has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.
any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations, including any proposed or implemented under the biden administration, could adversely affect the company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states and canada; (iii) increasing the company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the company's customers in the u.s. and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.
the company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. if the company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, csx could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. the company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which csx is responsible. in certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the company.
the company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.12
csx corporation part i availability of critical supplies and labor disruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.
the capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, rolling stock equipment and locomotives) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. in addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxt's costs. additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the company would be negatively impacted.
failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages.
most of csx's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. these agreements are either bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee or locally between csx and the union. such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. under the railway labor act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the president of the united states), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. if, however, csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members.
the unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the company's operational efficiency and ability to meet demand.
marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the company's ability to meet demand for rail service. although the company believes that it has adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the company's operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period.

csx corporation part ii global economic uncertainty, including the effects of covid-19 global pandemic, continues to impact the company's results of operations. demand for rail services saw large and rapid declines in the first half of the year, followed by steep sequential increases in the second half, but the effects of the disruption of global manufacturing, supply chains and consumer spending as a result of the covid-19 pandemic are ongoing. while operating cash flows have also been impacted by these economic conditions, the company maintains a strong cash balance and access to committed funding sources and other sources of external liquidity if required. as this is a dynamic situation, it is difficult to determine the future impacts of the pandemic. the full implications of covid-19, including the extent of its impact on the company's financial and operating results, will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues, its effect on the demand for the company's transportation services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic. the duration of the pandemic is dependent on several factors, including the timing of vaccine production and distribution as well as the impacts of virus mutations and case resurgences across the country.
csx employees that provide efficient and reliable rail service are essential to keeping supply chains fluid in response to this challenge. accordingly, business operations have been modified to ensure the safety of employees across the network while continuing to provide a high level of service to customers. a cross-functional task force monitors and coordinates the company's response to covid-19. policies and procedures established to protect the health and safety of employees and customers and to safeguard csx operations include rigorous cleaning regimens for equipment and facilities, provision of sanitation supplies, distribution of disposable face coverings, facilitation of social distancing measures and administration of temperature testing at certain facilities. these precautions remain in place despite the easing of pandemic restrictions by state and local governments across the network. additionally, remote work arrangements have been made where possible in order to reduce the density of employees in a single location, and alternative locations for key functions, such as dispatch, are being utilized as needed.
in march 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act ("cares act") was enacted to provide relief to businesses in response to the covid-19 pandemic. the most significant remaining impact to the company is the deferral of certain payroll tax payments to 2021 and 2022. the provisions of the cares act are not expected to have an impact on csx's results of operations or effective tax rate.

csx corporation part ii revenue the covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted overall volume in 2020. total revenue decreased $1.4 billion, in 2020 or 11%, when compared to the previous year due to declines in coal, lower merchandise volumes, decreases in fuel recovery and lower other revenue. these decreases were partially offset by pricing increases in merchandise and volume and pricing increases in intermodal.
merchandise volume chemicals - declined due to reduced frac sand and waste shipments, partially offset by growth in plastics shipments.
agricultural and food products - decreased due to lower shipments of feed grain as well as food and consumer products, partially offset by growth in sweeteners and oils.
automotive - declined due to lower north american vehicle production.
minerals - decreased due to lower shipments for aggregates and other minerals.
forest products - declined due to lower shipments of printing paper and building products, partially offset by higher pulpboard shipments.
metals and equipment - declined due to lower metals shipments, primarily in the steel, construction and scrap markets, as well as reduced equipment shipments.
fertilizers - declined due to reduced short-haul phosphate shipments.
intermodal volume increases in both domestic and international shipments resulted from tightening truck capacity and inventory replenishments in the second half of the year and growth in rail volumes from east coast ports.
coal volume domestic coal declined primarily due to lower shipments of utility coal as a result of continued competition from natural gas and reduced electrical demand, as well as lower steel and industrial shipments due to lower industrial production. export coal declined due to reduced international shipments of thermal and metallurgical coal as a result of lower global benchmark prices.
other other revenue decreased $110 million versus prior year primarily due to lower affiliate revenue, lower revenue for demurrage and a favorable contract settlement with a customer in the prior year.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.28
csx corporation part ii expense in 2020, total expenses decreased $751 million, or 11%, compared to prior year. descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.
labor and fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. these expenses decreased $341 million due to the following items:
•efficiency and volume savings of $288 million primarily resulted from structural changes to the train plan that resulted in reduced crew starts as well as lower headcount.
•incentive compensation decreased $86 million primarily due to lower expected annual incentive payouts as well as higher prior year accelerated stock compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees.
•other costs increased $33 million primarily due to inflation and several other non-significant items, including severance costs.
materials, supplies and other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services and professional services. this category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items including gains on property dispositions. total materials, supplies and other expenses decreased $65 million driven by the following:
•efficiency and volume savings of $185 million primarily resulted from lower operating support costs, lower terminal costs as a result of record productivity levels at intermodal terminals, and reduced equipment maintenance expenses.
•gains from real estate and line sales were $35 million in 2020 compared to $151 million in 2019.
•all other costs increased $4 million primarily due to inflation and other non-significant costs that were mostly offset by a $22 million non-railroad asset impairment in the prior year related to an intermodal terminal sale agreement.
depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. depreciation expense increased $34 million primarily due to the impacts of the 2019 equipment depreciation study as well as a larger net asset base.
fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. this expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. fuel expense decreased $365 million primarily due to a 31% price decrease that drove savings of $243 million, volume savings and a 5% improvement in fuel efficiency.
equipment and other expenses include rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by csxt for use of its equipment. this category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. these expenses decreased $14 million primarily due to volume savings, partially offset by higher days per load for automotive and other merchandise markets that resulted in increased car hire costs.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.29
csx corporation part ii interest expense interest expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and finance leases. interest expense increased $17 million as higher average debt balances were partially offset by lower average rates.
other income - net other income - net includes investment gains, losses and interest income, as well as components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. other income decreased $69 million primarily due to a $38 million increase in debt repurchase expense and decreased interest income driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash and short-term investment balances.
income tax expense income tax expense decreased $123 million primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes, partially offset by lower tax benefits from the impacts of stock option exercises and the vesting of other equity awards as well as prior year benefits from the resolution of certain state tax matters.
net earnings and earnings per diluted share net earnings decreased $566 million to $2.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share decreased $0.57 to $3.60, due to the factors mentioned above. average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.

csx corporation part ii non-gaap measures - unaudited csx reports its financial results in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). csx also uses certain non-gaap measures that fall within the meaning of securities and exchange commission regulation g and regulation s-k item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. non-gaap measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by gaap. therefore, csx's non-gaap measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. the presentation of these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap. reconciliations of non-gaap measures to corresponding gaap measures are below.
free cash flow management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the company's financial performance. more specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. this measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities, which includes proceeds from property dispositions. this measure should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. free cash flow before dividends decreased $832 million year-over-year to $2.6 billion primarily due to lower net cash provided by operating activities and lower proceeds from property dispositions.
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (gaap measure) to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (both non-gaap measures).

(a) the methodologies for calculating train velocity, dwell and cars online differ from those prescribed by the stb as the company believes these numbers more accurately reflect railroad performance. csxt will continue to report these metrics, using the prescribed methodology, to the stb on a weekly basis. see additional discussion on the company's website.
certain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle.
key performance measures definitions:
train velocity - average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). train velocity measures the profiled schedule of trains (from departure to arrival and all interim time), and train profiles are periodically updated to align with a changing operation.
dwell - average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard.
cars online - average number of active freight rail cars on lines operated by csx, excluding rail cars that are being repaired, in storage, those that have been sold, or private cars dwelling at a customer location more than one day.
revenue ton-miles (rtm's) - the movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile.
gross ton-miles (gtm's) - the movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. gtm's are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved. total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents.
on-time originations - percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on time or ahead of schedule.
on-time arrivals - percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on time to within two hours of scheduled arrival.
fra personal injury frequency index - number of fra-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours.
fra train accident rate - number of fra-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.
the company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the company's employees. continued capital investment in the company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.
despite operating challenges presented by the covid-19 pandemic, the company remained focused on safety, service and controlling costs. train velocity was roughly in line with last year's record performance, declining 1% relative to 2019. dwell increased by 8% compared to last year, while cars online decreased by 4% in 2020.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.32
csx corporation part ii from a safety perspective, the fra personal injury index improved 10% and train-accident rate increased 17% from the prior year. in 2020, the number of fra reportable injuries reached a new all-time record low for the second consecutive year. the number of fra reportable train accidents remained at a record-low level, but a reduction in train miles negatively impacted the fra train accident rate. the company is committed to operational and safety improvement, while remaining focused on reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and communities in which the company operates.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a company's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. to have a complete picture of a company's liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.

in 2020, the company generated $4.3 billion of cash provided by operating activities, which was $587 million lower than prior year primarily driven by lower cash-generating income and unfavorable working capital activities. net cash used in investing activities was $649 million, a decrease in net spend of $1.5 billion from the prior year primarily as a result of higher net sales of short-term investments, partially offset by lower proceeds from property dispositions. net cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion, which represents a decrease in net spend of $1.2 billion from the prior year primarily driven by lower share repurchases, partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances and higher debt repayments.
sources of cash and liquidity the company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. the company filed a shelf registration statement with the sec in february 2019 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx's discretion, subject to market conditions and csx board authorization. while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. in 2020, csx issued a total of $1.0 billion of new long-term debt.

csx corporation part ii csx has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in march 2024. as of december 31, 2020, the company had no outstanding balances under this facility. see note 10, debt and credit agreements for more information. the company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. as of december 31, 2020, the company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.
uses of cash csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital requirements, repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time, repurchases of csx's common stock, capital investments, improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives. the company also uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases.
in 2020, csx continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. funds used for property additions are further described below.
fiscal years capital expenditures (dollars in millions)                  2020                      2019

total capital expenditures                            $1,626                     1,657
planned capital investments for 2021 are expected to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. of the total 2021 investment, the majority will be used to sustain the core infrastructure and the remaining amounts will be allocated to projects supporting service enhancements, productivity initiatives and profitable growth. csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations.
ptc implementation is complete at a total cost of $2.4 billion, which included installing new equipment along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. while the company expects ongoing ptc costs, future ptc implementation costs are not expected to be material.
csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company's ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's operations and financial performance in the future (see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10-k).
csx 2020 form 10-k p.34
csx corporation part ii csx is committed to returning cash to shareholders. capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the board of directors. on february 10, 2021, the company's board of directors authorized an 8% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.28 per common share. management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.
material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and working capital csx's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csx's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. further, csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. the company ended the year with $3.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $1.5 billion from prior year end. the increase in assets was primarily due to the net increase of $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments as well as $276 million in net property additions. the net increase in cash and short-term investments was driven by $4.3 billion in cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of $1.0 billion of long-term debt. these increases were partially offset by property additions of $1.6 billion, share repurchases of $867 million, dividends paid of $797 million and long-term debt repayments of $745 million.
total liabilities increased $289 million from prior year end primarily due to the issuance of $1.0 billion of long-term debt and a $207 million increase in deferred tax liabilities primarily driven by accelerated tax depreciation. these increases were partially offset by debt repayments of $745 million and a $234 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to the conversion of accounts payable to conrail into notes payable. total shareholders' equity increased $1.2 billion from prior year end primarily driven by net earnings of $2.8 billion, partially offset by share repurchases of $867 million and dividends paid of $797 million.
working capital is considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. csx had a working capital surplus of $2.4 billion at december 2020 and $1.1 billion at december 2019, an increase of $1.3 billion. the increase in current assets was primarily driven by the net increase in cash and short-term investments described above and the decrease in current liabilities was due to lower accounts payable partially offset by higher current maturities of long-term debt.
the company's working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances. although the company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. furthermore, csx has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.35
csx corporation part ii credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency's judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. the ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower's industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company's cash flows to changes in the economy. the two largest rating agencies, standard & poor's ratings services ("s&p") and moody's investors service ("moody's"), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. the highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is aaa and aaa for s&p and moody's, respectively. a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csx's long-term credit ratings. csx's credit ratings remained stable during 2020. as of december 2020 and december 2019, s&p's long-term rating on csx was bbb+ (stable), and moody's was baa1 (stable). ratings of bbb- and baa3 or better by s&p and moody's, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. if csx's credit ratings were to decline to below investment-grade levels, the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. in addition, a decline in csx's credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market's demand, and thus the company's ability to readily issue new debt. the company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.
guaranteed notes issued by csxt in march 2020, the sec adopted amendments to reduce and simplify the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed registered securities effective january 4, 2021, with early voluntary compliance permitted. csx elected to comply with these amendments effective second quarter 2020. as a result, separate condensed consolidating financial information for wholly-owned subsidiaries who issued or guaranteed notes is no longer included in the footnotes to the financial statements in quarterly and annual reports on form 10-q and form 10-k. also in accordance with the amendments, csx is not required to present combined summary financial information regarding such subsidiary issuers and guarantors because the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined issuers and guarantors of the notes are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements.
in 2007, csxt, a wholly-owned subsidiary of csx corporation, issued $381 million of secured equipment notes maturing in 2023 in a registered public offering. csx corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. at csxt's option, csxt may redeem any or all of the notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption price including premium. in the case of loss or destruction of any item of equipment securing the notes, if csxt does not substitute another item of equipment for the item suffering such loss or destruction, csxt will be required to redeem the notes in part at par. the guarantee of the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of csx corporation and will be effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness of csx corporation to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. the guarantee is subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. as of december 31, 2020, the principal balance of these secured equipment notes was $160 million.

csx corporation part ii off-balance sheet arrangements for detailed information about the company's guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see note 8, commitments and contingencies. there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
labor agreements approximately 15,700 of the company's nearly 19,300 employees are members of a labor union. in november 2019, notices were served to the 13 rail unions that participate in national bargaining to begin negotiations for benefits, wages and work rules for the next labor bargaining round for 2020. current agreements remain in place until modified by these negotiations. typically, such negotiations take several years before agreements are reached.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results may differ from those estimates. these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis. significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:
•personal injury, environmental and legal reserves;
•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting; and
•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method.
personal injury, environmental and legal reserves personal injury personal injury reserves of $131 million and $129 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. csxt retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. it is based largely on csxt's historical claims and settlement experience. actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. for additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see note 5, casualty, environmental and other reserves in the consolidated financial statements.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.38
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued environmental environmental reserves were $76 million and $74 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 220 environmentally impaired sites. the company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:
•type of clean-up required;
•nature of the company's alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);
•extent of the company's alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and
•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.
conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. for additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see note 5, casualty, environmental and other reserves in the consolidated financial statements.
legal the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits. the company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate. the amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. for additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see note 5, casualty, environmental and other reserves in the consolidated financial statements. additionally, see item 3. legal proceedings for further discussion of these items.
pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. for employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. for employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. beginning in 2020, the csx pension plan was closed to new participants. as of december 2020, the projected benefit obligation for the company's pension plans was $3.3 billion.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.39
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued in addition to these plans, the company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. changes to the post-retirement medical and life insurance plans were communicated to participants in october 2018. beginning in 2019, both the life insurance benefit for eligible active employees and health savings account contributions made by the company to eligible retirees younger than 65 were eliminated. beginning in 2020, the employer-funded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older were eliminated. as a result of these plan amendments, the company recognized a decrease of $102 million in the post-retirement benefit liability and a corresponding gain in other comprehensive income in 2018. as of december 2020, the projected benefit obligation for the company's other post-retirement benefit plans was $96 million.
for information related to the funded status of the company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see note 9, employee benefit plans.
the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensation-retirement benefits topic in the asc. this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:
•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;
•long-term rate of return on plan assets;
•salary scale inflation rates; and
•other assumptions.
the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. these amounts are reviewed by management.
discount rates discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and post-retirement expense. discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the company's expected future benefit payments. the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.
the company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.40
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its 2020 pension and post-retirement obligations are 2.43 percent and 2.07 percent, respectively. for 2019, the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations were 3.13 percent and 2.87 percent, respectively. discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. as of december 2020, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively.
each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. in general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.
long-term rate of return on plan assets the expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. in estimating that rate, the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. management, with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. as this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. the long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75 percent in both 2020 and 2019.
salary scale inflation rates salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company.  the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. the company used a salary scale rate of 4.60 percent in both 2020 and 2019 to value its pension obligations.
other assumptions the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. these assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.
2021 estimated pension and post-retirement expense net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2021 are expected to be a $21 million credit and a $5 million credit, respectively. net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2021 are expected to include service cost expense of $38 million and $1 million, respectively. service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense are included in other income - net. net periodic pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense in 2020 were costs of $3 million and less than $1 million, respectively. the net decrease in the expected expense is primarily due to expected favorable pension asset experience.
csx 2020 form 10-k p.41
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2021 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:
(dollars in millions)                  pension expense   post-retirement expense discount rate                              $20           $1
long-term rate of return                   $28           n/a salary inflation                            $5           n/a depreciation policies for assets utilizing the group-life method the depreciable assets of the company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with gaap. the company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 87% of total fixed assets of $45.5 billion on a gross basis at december 31, 2020. the remaining depreciable assets of the company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. land is not depreciated.
management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's methods to determine the service lives of its properties. there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:
•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;
•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;
•evaluation of current operations;
•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;
•previous assessment of the condition of the assets;
•management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;
•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and
•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.
the company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the company's depreciation expense of $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. a one percent change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the company's annual depreciation expense. for additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see note 6, properties in the consolidated financial statements.

forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual performance or results could differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. if the company does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements.

the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect truist's financial condition and operations. when a risk factor spans several risk categories, the risks have been listed by their primary risk category. the risks described are not all inclusive. additional risks that are not presently known or risks deemed immaterial may have a material adverse effect on truist's financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects.
merger-related risks truist may not be able to successfully integrate the companies or to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.
the company was formed by the merger of bb&t and suntrust on december 6, 2019. truist anticipates further integration of systems, operations, and personnel of bb&t and suntrust over the next couple of years.
the successful integration of bb&t's and suntrust's operations will depend substantially on the company's ability to successfully consolidate operations, management teams, corporate cultures, systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs. truist may encounter difficulties during integration, such as:
•the loss of key teammates and clients;
•the disruption of operations and businesses;
•loan, deposit, and revenue attrition;
•inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies;
•unexpected issues with planned branch and other facilities closures;
•unexpected issues with costs, operations, personnel, technology; and
•problems with the assimilation of new operations, sites or personnel.
integration activities have and will continue to divert resources from regular operations. in addition, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry may inhibit the company's successful integration of these entities.
22 truist financial corporation bb&t and suntrust merged with the expectation that the merger would result in various synergies, including benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened and expanded market position for the combined organization, technology efficiencies, cost savings and operating efficiencies. achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the company integrates the institutions in an efficient and effective manner, as well as general competitive factors in the marketplace. failure to achieve or delays in achieving these anticipated benefits could result in a share price reduction as well as increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management's time and energy and could materially and adversely affect the company's financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects.
truist will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the merger and the integration.
there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated. in addition, the merger may increase the company's compliance and legal risks, including increased litigation or regulatory actions such as fines or restrictions related to the business practices or operations of the combined business.
while the company has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are many factors beyond the company's control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. these expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the expected savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale. the amount and timing of future charges to earnings as a result of merger or integration expenses are uncertain.
covid-19 risks the effects of covid-19 have adversely impacted, and will likely continue to adversely impact, the company's financial condition and results of operations.
the covid-19 pandemic has severely disrupted almost all economic activity in the u.s. despite the partial lifting of federal and state shelter-in-place orders, some of which have been renewed, it remains unknown when there will be a return to normal economic activity due to continued significant numbers of new cases, potential impact of new covid strains, uncertain vaccination rollout timeline, and increased economic stress associated with the pandemic. truist temporarily limited access to certain offices, limited branches to drive-thru and appointment only, suspended some services and the majority of the company's workforce is working remotely, which may increase cybersecurity risks to the company. approximately 90% of branches are open and unlocked, or open with controlled access. truist continues to follow appropriate covid-19 safety protocols, including proper social distancing. commercial clients are experiencing varying levels of disruptions or restrictions on their business activity and supply chains, closures of facilities or decreases in demand for their products and services. consumer clients are experiencing interrupted income or unemployment. certain industries have been particularly susceptible to the effects of the pandemic, such as hotels, resorts, cruise lines, oil and gas companies, senior and acute care facilities, restaurants, and other sensitive retail businesses, and truist has outstanding loans to clients in these industries. in 2020, several credit rating agencies downgraded their outlook on u.s. banks due in part to the concerns presented by the pandemic. the global financial markets have also experienced significant volatility. the duration of this severe economic disruption and its related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
the effects of the pandemic have already resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses, a reduction of fee income, a reduction of net interest margin and an increase in expenses. prolonged continuation of current conditions could worsen these impacts and also affect the company's capital and liquidity position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause an outflow of deposits, cause significant property damage, in case of civil unrest or vandalism, influence the recognition of credit losses on loans and securities and further increase the allowance for credit losses, result in additional lost revenue, cause additional increases in expenses, result in goodwill impairment charges, result in the impairment of other financial and nonfinancial assets, and increase the company's cost of capital.
intensive government actions to mitigate the economic suffering caused by the pandemic may not be successful or may result in increased pressure on the banking sector. net interest margin has been, and is likely to continue to be, affected by the very low interest rate environment. the application of forbearance and payment deferral policies beyond any statutory requirements may impact truist's interest income. truist participated in the sba's ppp, which was recently expanded to permit a second round of funding, as an eligible lender with the benefit of a government guaranty of loans to small business clients, many of whom may face difficulties even after being granted such a loan. the company faces increased risks, in terms of credit, fraud risk and litigation, in light of participation in this program. truist has been named in several lawsuits relating to its participation in the ppp.

it is possible that the pandemic and its aftermath will lead to a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the u.s. economy or the world economy in general. the ultimate impact on the company's financial condition, results of operation, and liquidity and capital position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and the actions to contain or treat its impact. moreover, the effects of the covid-19 pandemic will heighten the other risks described in this annual report on form 10-k.
market risks changes in interest rates could adversely affect revenue and expenses, the value of assets and liabilities, as well as the availability and cost of capital, cash flows and liquidity.
truist's balance sheet can be sensitive to movements in market interest rates and spreads as well as basis risk arising from the company's alm activities, which management must closely monitor. in addition to the impact of the general economy, changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact the company in one or more of the following ways:
•the yield on earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities may change in disproportionate ways; or
•the value of financial instruments held could change adversely.
regional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities affect interest income and interest expense. when interest rates rise, funding costs may rise faster than the yield the company earns on assets, causing net interest margin to contract. higher interest rates may also result in lower mortgage production income and elevated charge-offs in certain categories of the loan portfolio. conversely, when interest rates fall, the yield the company earns on assets may fall faster than the company's ability to lower rates paid on deposits or borrowings.
certain investment securities, notably mbs, are very sensitive to changes in rates. generally, when rates rise, prepayments will decrease and the duration of mbs will increase. conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mbs will decrease.
in addition, in response to the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic and its economic consequences, the frb lowered its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%. low rates increase the risk of a negative interest rate environment, either broadly or for some types of instruments. for example, in march 2020 the yields on one-month and three-month treasuries briefly dropped below zero. a negative interest rate environment could have a material adverse effect on truist's financial condition and results of operations. in a negative interest rate environment, some depositors may choose to withdraw their deposits in lieu of paying an interest rate to truist to hold such deposits. negative rates would also diminish the spreads on loans and securities. further, truist cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies in response to the covid-19 pandemic or the effects that they may have on the company's activities and financial results.
the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on profitability.
changes in monetary and fiscal policies, including frb policies, can adversely affect profitability and cannot be controlled or predicted by the company. frb policies can:
•significantly impact the cost of funds, as well as the return on assets, both of which can have an impact on interest income;
•materially affect the value of financial assets and liabilities;
•adversely affect borrowers through higher debt servicing costs and potentially increase the risk that they may fail to repay their loan obligations; and
•artificially inflate asset values during prolonged periods of accommodative policy, which could in turn cause volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values.
financial results, lending or other business activities could be materially affected by a deterioration of economic conditions.
a prolonged period of slow growth in the u.s. economy as a whole or in any regional markets that truist serves, or any deterioration in economic conditions or the financial markets may disrupt or dampen the economy, which could materially adversely affect the company's financial condition and results.
24 truist financial corporation if economic conditions deteriorate, the company may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy clients, reducing the company's interest income. in addition, if unemployment levels increase or if real estate prices decrease, the company would expect to incur higher charge-offs and may incur higher expenses in connection with adjustments to the reasonable and supportable forecasts used to estimate the allowance for credit losses in accordance with cecl requirements. these conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, especially for those businesses that rely on the health of industries or properties that may suffer from deteriorating economic conditions. the ability of these borrowers to repay their loans may be reduced, causing the company to incur higher credit losses.
the deterioration of economic conditions also could adversely affect financial results for the company's fee-based businesses. truist earns fee income from, among other activities, managing assets for clients and providing brokerage and other investment advisory and wealth management services. investment management fees are often based on the value of assets under management and a decrease in the market prices of those assets could reduce the company's fee income. changes in stock or fixed income market prices or client preferences could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other fees earned from the company's brokerage business. poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets would likely adversely affect the company's capital markets-related businesses.
instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on the company's operations, earnings and financial condition.
instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on the company's operations, earnings and financial condition. the macroeconomic environment in the united states is susceptible to global events and volatility in financial markets. for example, trade negotiations between the u.s. and other nations remains uncertain and could adversely impact economic and market conditions for the company and its clients and counterparties.
a negative change in economic conditions, the performance of foreign sovereign debt, changes of trade policies and other matters could adversely affect the company's business, financial condition and liquidity. domestic and global political activity, geopolitical matters, including international political unrest or disturbances, terrorist activities, military conflicts, concerns over energy prices, trade wars and economic instability or recession in certain regions could cause volatility in the financial markets, undermine investor confidence or cause a contraction of available credit. any of these could reduce the value of the company's assets or cause a reduction in liquidity that adversely impacts the company's financial condition and results of operations.
the replacement of libor could adversely affect truist's profitability and financial condition.
libor and certain other interest rate benchmarks are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. libor in its current form was anticipated to no longer be available after 2021.
on november 30, 2020 the administrator of libor announced it will consult on its intention to cease publication of the one-week and two-month settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31, 2021, and the remaining u.s. dollar libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30, 2023. while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor, a group of market participants convened by the frb, the arrc, has selected the sofr as its recommended alternative to u.s. dollar libor. in 2020, truist began offering sofr-based lending solutions to wholesale and consumer clients, and entered into sofr-based derivative contracts.
the u.s. federal banking agencies issued a statement in november 2020 encouraging banks to transition away from u.s. dollar libor as soon as practicable and to stop entering into new contracts that use u.s. dollar libor by december 31, 2021. sofr or other alternative reference rates may perform differently than libor in response to changing market conditions. for example, sofr could experience greater decreases during times of economic stress, which could require the company to lend at lower rates at times when the company's borrowing costs are increasing.
the market transition away from libor to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. in particular, any such transition could:
•adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of the company's libor-based assets and liabilities;
•adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of other securities or financial arrangements, given libor's role in determining market interest rates globally;
•prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the company's preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate; and truist financial corporation 25
•result in disputes, litigation or other actions with borrowers or counterparties about the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in libor-based contracts and securities.
the transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate or rates will require the transition to or development of appropriate systems, models and analytics to effectively transition the company's risk management and other processes from libor-based products to those based on the applicable alternative reference rate, such as sofr. truist has developed a libor transition team and project plan that outlines timelines and priorities to prepare its processes, systems and people to support this transition. timelines and priorities include assessing the impact on the company's clients, as well as assessing system requirements for operational processes. there can be no guarantee that these efforts will successfully mitigate the operational risks associated with the transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate.
the manner and impact of the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on the company's funding costs, loan, investment and trading securities portfolios, and alm, is uncertain.
credit risks the company is subject to credit risk by lending or committing to lend money, or entering into a letter of credit or other types of contracts with counterparties.
truist incurs credit risk, which is the risk of loss if the company's borrowers or counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts. a number of products expose the company to credit risk, including loans and leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading assets and investment securities. changes in credit quality can have a significant impact on the company's earnings and capital position. the company estimates and establishes reserves for credit risks and credit losses inherent in its determination of credit exposure. this process, which is critical to the company's financial results and condition, requires complex calculations and extensive use of judgment, considering both external and borrower-specific factors that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. as is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that the company will fail to identify all pertinent factors or that the company will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors identified.
credit losses may exceed the amount of the company's reserves as a result of changing economic conditions, including falling real estate or commodity prices and higher unemployment or other factors such as changes in borrower behavior. there is no assurance that reserves will be sufficient to cover all incurred credit losses. in the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, the company may be required to increase reserves in future periods, which would reduce the company's earnings and potentially impact its capital.
the company may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent that loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type or location of the borrower or collateral.
the company's credit risk and credit losses can increase if the company's loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or in borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions.
deterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions or real estate values, including as a result of climate change or natural disasters, in the markets in which the company operates could result in materially higher credit losses. the company is also subject to physical risks, which could manifest in the form of asset quality deterioration and could be exacerbated by specific portfolio concentrations, and transition risks, which could manifest through longer-term shifts in market dynamics and consumer preferences in specific industries that may be more sensitive or vulnerable to a transition to a low carbon economy. shorter term transition risks arising from regulatory changes or technological breakthroughs may require an acceleration of certain risk mitigation strategies.
liquidity risks truist's liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access short-term funding or an unforeseen outflow of cash.
liquidity is essential to truist's businesses. when volatility or disruptions occur in the wholesale funding markets, the company's ability to access short-term liquidity could be materially impaired. in addition, other factors outside of the company's control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties, could impair the company's ability to access short-term funding or create an unforeseen outflow of cash due to, among other factors, draws on unfunded commitments or deposit attrition. the company's inability to access short-term funding or capital markets could constrain the company's ability to make new loans or meet existing lending commitments and could ultimately jeopardize the company's overall liquidity and capitalization.
26 truist financial corporation loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase truist's funding costs.
deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. truist competes with banks and other financial institutions for deposits and as a result, could lose deposits in the future or see an increase in costs associated with maintaining deposits. clients may shift their deposits into higher cost products or the company may need to raise interest rates to avoid deposit attrition. funding costs may also increase if deposits lost are replaced with wholesale funding. higher funding costs reduce truist's net interest margin, net interest income, and net income.
truist relies on the mortgage secondary market and gses for some of the company's liquidity.
truist sells a portion of the mortgage loans originated to reduce the company's retained credit risk and to provide funding capacity for originating additional loans. gses could limit their purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints or other changes in their criteria for conforming loans (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). this potential reduction in purchases could limit the company's ability to fund new loans.
proposals have been presented to reform the housing finance market in the u.s., including the role of the gses in the housing finance market. the extent and timing of any such regulatory reform of the housing finance market and the gses, as well as any effect on the company's business and financial results, are uncertain.
any reduction in the company's credit rating could increase the cost of the company's funding from the capital markets.
ratings agencies regularly evaluate truist and its subsidiaries. ratings are based on a number of factors, including the financial strength of the company as well as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect funding cost and increase the company's cost of capital. a credit downgrade might also affect the company's ability to attract or retain deposits from commercial and corporate clients. additionally, the company's ability to conduct derivatives business with certain clients and counterparties could also be impacted and could trigger obligations to make cash or collateral payments to certain clients and counterparties.
the parent company has less access to funding sources and its liquidity could be constrained if the bank becomes unable to pay dividends during a time of stress.
the parent company relies upon capital markets access and dividends from affiliates for funding and has less access to contingent funding sources than the bank. if the bank were subject to a financial stress, its dividends to the parent company could be reduced or eliminated in order to support bank capital ratios or other regulatory requirements. this would increase the parent company's reliance on capital markets at a time when spreads and funding costs are likely elevated due the stress impacting the bank.
compliance risks truist is subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision, which could increase the cost of doing business, limit truist's ability to make investments and generate revenue and lead to costly enforcement actions.
the banking and financial services industries are highly regulated. truist is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by regulators, including the frb, fdic, nccob, sec, cftc, cfpb, finra and various state regulatory agencies. the statutory and regulatory framework governing truist is generally intended to protect depositors, the dif, clients, and the u.s. financial system as a whole, and not truist's debt holders or shareholders. reform of the financial services industry resulting from the dodd-frank act, including the egrrcpa and other legislative, regulatory and technological changes, affect the company's operations.
these laws and regulations and truist's inability to act in certain instances without receiving prior regulatory approval affect truist's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to repurchase common stock and ability to pursue strategic acquisitions, among other activities. changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation and the continued heightening of regulatory requirements could affect truist in substantial and unpredictable ways. federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. these supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher deposit insurance premiums and limitations on the company's activities that could have a material adverse effect on operations or profitability.

in recent years, both congress and the federal banking regulators have engaged in a rebalancing of the post financial crisis legal and regulatory framework, particularly by tailoring enhanced prudential standards to the size, risk profile and complexity of the banking organization. it is possible that the new presidential administration and the new congress could reconsider this rebalancing of the legal and regulatory framework and also impose significant new regulatory and supervisory burdens on the financial sector. truist expects that its businesses will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. any potential new regulations or modifications to existing regulations would likely necessitate changes to truist's existing regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure. compliance with new regulations and supervisory initiatives, including those newly applicable as a result of the merger may increase costs. in addition, concerns over climate change may prompt changes in regulations that, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on asset values and the financial performance of truist's businesses and its clients.
truist is subject to heightened requirements under the enhanced prudential standards and expects increased supervisory scrutiny, including, for example, single counterparty credit limits, heightened expectations with respect to governance, risk management and internal controls and additional capital and liquidity requirements.
the financial services industry faces scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and stringent enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. areas of focus in the recent past have been with respect to mortgage-related practices, student lending practices, auto lending practices, sales practices and related incentive compensation programs and other consumer compliance matters. truist continues to be subject to examinations and ongoing monitoring to assess compliance with bsa/aml laws and regulations, as well as sanctions compliance administered by the ofac. for example, during november 2019, suntrust bank entered into a consent order with the frb in connection with marketing, enrollment and billing practices related to deposit account add-on and similar products provided to certain business customers. current and future actions by regulators could impact truist's operations. see additional disclosures in the "regulatory considerations" section.
the company is subject to laws, rules and regulations regarding compliance with privacy policies and the disclosure, collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of personal identifiable information of certain parties. there has recently been an increase in legislative and regulatory efforts to protect the privacy of consumer data. these initiatives may limit how companies can use customer data and may increase compliance complexity and related costs, result in significant financial penalties for compliance failures and limit the company's ability to develop new products or respond to technological changes. such legal requirements also could heighten the reputational impact of perceived misuses of customer data by the company and third parties.
heightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. there is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against truist. furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the united states or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in foreign jurisdictions.
federal law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators and law enforcement agencies. this enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines or restitution; to issue cease and desist or removal orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
a failure to comply with regulatory requirements and expectations could expose the company to fines, regulatory penalties, other costs, reputational damage and regulatory or enforcement actions, such as limitations on engaging in new activities or expanding geographically. in some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant consequences for a financial institution, including loss of clients, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management practices also may be incorporated into truist's confidential supervisory ratings. a downgrade in these ratings or these or other regulatory actions and settlements, could limit truist's ability to conduct expansionary activities for a period of time and require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities. any future enforcement action could have a material adverse impact.
regulatory changes may reduce truist's revenues, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer, alter the investments it makes, affect the manner in which it operates its businesses, increase its litigation and regulatory costs should it fail to appropriately comply with new or modified laws and regulatory requirements and increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products.
28 truist financial corporation truist is subject to regulatory capital and liquidity standards that affect the company's business, operations and ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders.
truist is subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements established by the frb and the fdic. these regulatory capital and liquidity requirements are typically developed at an international level by the bcbs and then applied, with adjustments, in each country by the appropriate domestic regulatory bodies. domestic regulatory agencies have the ability to apply stricter capital and liquidity standards than those developed by the bcbs. in several instances, the u.s. banking agencies have done so with respect to u.s. banking organizations.
requirements to maintain specified levels of capital and liquidity and regulatory expectations as to the quality of the company's capital and liquidity may prevent the company from taking advantage of opportunities in the best interest of shareholders or force the company to take actions contrary to their interests. for example, truist may be limited in its ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. in addition, these requirements may impact the amount and type of loans the company is able to make. truist may be constrained in its ability to expand, either organically or through mergers and acquisitions. these requirements may cause the company to sell or refrain from acquiring assets where the capital requirements appear inconsistent with the assets' underlying risks. in addition, liquidity standards require the company to maintain holdings of highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the company's ability to invest in less liquid assets, even if more desirable from a balance sheet or interest rate risk management perspective. as a category iii banking organization, truist is subject to additional capital and liquidity requirements.
the liquidity standards applicable to large u.s. banking organizations have also been supplemented in recent years. for example, in october 2020, the u.s. banking agencies finalized rules to implement the nsfr, which is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities.
in addition to the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to truist and truist bank, the company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements established by the sec.
regulatory capital and liquidity requirements receive periodic review and revision by the bcbs and the u.s. banking agencies. changes to capital and liquidity requirements may require truist or truist bank to maintain more or higher quality capital or greater liquidity and could increase some of the potential adverse effects described above.
truist is subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers.
truist is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated when selling mortgage loans or loan securitizations. an increase in the number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers related to representations and warranties on loans sold could result in an increase in the amount of losses for loan repurchases. truist also bears a risk of loss from borrower defaults for multi-family commercial mortgage loans sold to fnma.
in addition to repurchase claims from gses, truist could be subject to indemnification claims from non-gse purchasers of the company's loans. claims could be made if truist fails to conform to statements about the quality of the mortgage loans sold, the manner in which the loans were originated and underwritten or to comply with state and federal law.
truist faces risks as a servicer of loans.
the company acts as servicer and master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations and for unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors. as a servicer or master servicer for those loans, the company has certain contractual obligations to the securitization trusts, investors or other third parties. as a servicer, truist's obligations include foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the applicable securitization or other investor agreement, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales. in the company's capacity as a master servicer, obligations include overseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by the servicer. generally, the company's servicing obligations are set by contract, for which the company receives a contractual fee. however, gses can amend their servicing guidelines, which can increase the scope or costs of the services required without any corresponding increase in the company's servicing fee. further, the cfpb has implemented national servicing standards which have increased the scope and costs of services which the company is required to perform. in addition, there has been a significant increase in state laws that impose additional servicing requirements that increase the scope and cost of the company's servicing obligations. as a servicer, the company also advances expenses on behalf of investors which it may be unable to collect.
truist financial corporation 29
a material breach of the company's obligations as servicer or master servicer may result in contract termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, which can generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security holders, causing the company to lose servicing income. in addition, the company may be required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses from any failure by the company, as a servicer or master servicer, to perform the company's servicing obligations or any act or omission on the company's part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence. for certain investors and certain transactions, truist may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. the company may be subject to increased repurchase obligations as a result of claims made that the company did not satisfy its obligations as a servicer or master servicer. the company may also experience increased loss severity on repurchases, which may require a material increase to the company's repurchase reserve.
the company has and may continue to receive indemnification requests related to the company's servicing of loans owned or insured by other parties, primarily gses. typically, such a claim seeks to impose a compensatory fee on the company for departures from gse service levels. in most cases, this is related to delays in the foreclosure process. additionally, the company has received indemnification requests where an investor or insurer has suffered a loss due to a breach of the servicing agreement. while the number of such claims has been small, these could increase in the future.
strategic risks truist may face the risk of financial loss or negative impact resulting from ineffective strategy setting and execution, adverse business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the external environment.
embedded within strategic risks are risks associated with:
•maintaining a level of earnings appropriate to support growth objectives and the ability to maintain dividends in various economic cycles,
•successful delivery of innovation and technology strategies that transform the client experience as well as the way truist conducts business, and
•changes and events within the external environment, including geopolitical, macroeconomic, social, cultural, competitive and regulatory factors.
any of the foregoing may impact the successful execution of truist's strategy.
competition may reduce truist's client base or cause truist to modify pricing for products and services in order to maintain market share.
truist operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive with neo-banks and other fintechs. increased competition could arise from technological advancements, legislative and regulatory changes, as well as competition from other financial services companies, some of which may be subject to less extensive regulation than truist. the company's success depends, in part, on the company's ability to adapt its offering of products and services to evolving industry standards and client expectations. the widespread adoption of new technologies has required and will continue to require substantial investments to modify existing products and services or to develop new products and services. in addition, there is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices further reducing contribution margins. the company may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology or those new products may not achieve market acceptance.
truist also competes with nonbank companies inside and outside of the company's market area and, in some cases, with companies other than those traditionally considered financial sector participants. in particular, technology companies are increasingly focusing on the financial sector, either in partnership with competitor banking organizations or on their own. these companies generally are not subject to the same regulatory burdens as main street financial institutions and may accordingly realize certain cost strategies and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the client. this competition could result in the loss of clients and revenue in areas where fintechs are operating. as the pace of technology and change advance, continuous innovation is expected to exert long-term pressure on the financial services industry.
the adoption of new technologies by competitors, including internet banking services, mobile applications, advanced atm functionality and cryptocurrencies could require the company to make substantial investments to modify or adapt the company's existing products and services or even radically alter the way truist conducts business. these and other capital investments in the company's business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure.
30 truist financial corporation certain external environmental factors could also impact the company's strategy. increasing frequency and severity of impacts from natural disasters brought on by climate change may alter the company's strategic direction in order to mitigate certain financial risks. while material impact from climate change is expected to occur over a longer time horizon, the acceleration of a transition to a low-carbon economy could present idiosyncratic risks in certain sectors and carbon intensive industries over time. climate change is expected to present incremental risks to the execution of the company's long-term strategy. in addition, concerns over climate change may prompt changes in regulations that, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on asset values and the financial performance of truist's businesses, and those of its clients.
truist may not be able to complete future mergers or acquisitions.
the company must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions before completing an acquisition of another bank or bhc, including federal and state regulatory approvals. in determining whether to approve a proposed bank or bhc acquisition, bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition; financial condition and future prospects, including current and projected capital ratios and levels; the competence, experience and integrity of management; record of compliance with laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the cra; the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities; and protests from various stakeholders. in addition, u.s. regulators must take systemic risk to the u.s. financial system into account when evaluating whether to approve a potential acquisition transaction involving a large financial institution like truist. there is no certainty as to when or if or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted for any potential acquisition. in specific cases, truist may be required to sell banks or branches or take other actions as a condition to receiving regulatory approval. an inability to satisfy other conditions necessary to consummate an acquisition transaction, such as third party litigation, a judicial order blocking the transaction or lack of shareholder approval, could also prevent the company from completing an announced acquisition.
truist has businesses other than banking that are subject to a variety of risks.
truist is a diversified financial services company and this diversity subjects the company's earnings to a broader variety of risks and uncertainties. other businesses in addition to banking that the company operates include insurance, investment banking, securities underwriting and market making, loan syndications, investment management and advice and retail and wholesale brokerage services offered through the company's subsidiaries. these businesses entail significant market, operational, credit, compliance, technology, legal and other risks that could materially adversely impact the company's results of operations.
reputational risks negative public opinion could damage the company's reputation and adversely impact business and revenues.
truist's earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. negative public opinion could result from the company's actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending, sales and other operating practices, corporate governance, acquisitions, a breach of client or teammate information, the failure of any product or service sold to meet clients' expectations or applicable regulatory requirements. negative public opinion could adversely affect the company's ability to attract and retain clients and personnel and can result in litigation and regulatory actions. actual or alleged conduct by one of the company's businesses can result in negative public opinion about the company's other businesses. actual or alleged conduct by another financial institution can result in negative public opinion about the financial services industry in general and, as a result, adversely affect truist.
scrutiny of the company's sales, training and incentive compensation practices could damage the company's reputation and adversely impact business and revenues.
the company may face increased scrutiny of the company's sales and other business practices, training practices, incentive compensation design and governance, and quality assurance and client complaint resolution practices. there can be no assurance that the company's processes and actions will meet regulatory standards or expectations. findings from self-identified or regulatory reviews may require responsive actions, including increased investments in compliance systems and personnel or the payment of fines, penalties, increased regulatory assessments or client redress and may increase legal or reputational risk exposures.
truist financial corporation 31
operational risks litigation may adversely affect the company's results.
the company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by the company's regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. the outcome of litigation and regulatory matters as well as the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict.
actual legal and other costs of resolving claims may be greater than the company's legal reserves. the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations and financial condition.
in addition, governmental authorities have, at times, sought criminal penalties against companies in the financial services sector for violations, and, at times, have required an admission of wrongdoing from financial institutions in connection with resolving such matters. criminal convictions or admissions of wrongdoing in a settlement with the government can lead to greater exposure in civil litigation and reputational harm.
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against the company could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm, which adversely impact the company's business prospects. further, the company may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations and financial condition.
the company may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, including inadvertent or unintentional violations.
truist maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective. in addition to fines and penalties, the company may suffer other negative consequences from regulatory violations including restrictions on certain activities, such as the company's mortgage business, which may affect the company's relationship with the gses and may also damage the company's reputation and this in turn might materially affect the company's business and results of operations.
further, some legal frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even when the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even when there were systems and procedures in place designed to ensure compliance. for example, truist is subject to regulations issued by ofac that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated nationals of those countries. ofac may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. courts may uphold significant additional penalties on financial institutions, even where the financial institution had already reimbursed the government or other counterparties for actual losses.
truist relies on other companies to provide key components of the company's business infrastructure.
third parties provide key components of the company's business infrastructure, such as banking services, data processing, business processes, internet connections and network access. any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the company's ability to deliver products and services to clients, to support teammates and otherwise to conduct business. technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the company's business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. further, in some instances, the company may be responsible for failures of such third parties to comply with government regulations. the company is not insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. failures in the company's business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.
truist depends on the expertise of key personnel. if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer.
the company's success depends, to a large degree, on the continued services of executive officers and other key personnel who have extensive experience in the industry. the company's business could be adversely impacted from the loss of key persons or failure to manage a smooth transition to new personnel. these risks may be exacerbated as the company continues to integrate processes and systems subsequent to the merger.
32 truist financial corporation the company may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of changes in the marketplace, which may increase costs and adversely impact the company's ability to implement business strategies.
the company's success depends upon the ability to attract and retain high performing, diverse and well-qualified personnel. the company faces significant competition in the recruitment of highly motivated teammates that can deliver truist's purpose, mission and values. the company's ability to execute its business strategy and provide high quality service may suffer if the company is unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified teammates or if the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially. the u.s. banking agencies have jointly issued comprehensive guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging teammates to take imprudent risks. this guidance significantly affects the amount, form and context of incentive compensation to teammates. the frb, fdic, sec and other federal regulatory agencies have jointly proposed rules, which would affect incentive compensation. these rules, which have been pending for several years, if finalized, may result in additional costs and restrictions on the form of the company's incentive compensation.
the company's framework for managing risks may not be effective.
the company's risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. truist has established policies, processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the company is subject, including liquidity, credit, market, operational, technology, reputational, legal, model and compliance risk, among others. however, the company's risk management measures may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating the company's risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated, even if the models for assessing risk are properly designed and implemented. some of the company's methods of managing risk are based upon the company's use of observed historical market behavior and management's judgment. these methods may not accurately predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than historical measures indicate. if the company's risk management framework proves ineffective, it could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.
there are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in truist's business, which may impact decisions made by management and regulators.
truist relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.
poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that truist's business decisions based on information incorporating model output would be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. also, information truist provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. some of the decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to truist's shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.
the company is at risk of increased losses from fraud.
criminals committing fraud increasingly are using more sophisticated techniques and in some cases, are a part of larger criminal organizations, which allow them to be more effective. fraudulent activity has taken many forms and escalates as more tools for accessing financial services emerge, such as real-time payments. fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving and include such things as debit card/credit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices attached to atm machines, social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information or impersonation of the company's clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials.
in addition, individuals or business entities may properly identify themselves, yet seek to establish a business relationship for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. increased deployment of technologies, such as chip card technology, defray and reduce aspects of fraud; however, criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information, such as unaffiliated healthcare providers and government entities, in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud. further, as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity, the company has increased spending on systems, resources and controls to detect and prevent fraud, as well as increased spending to provide certain credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to the company's consumer clients. this will result in continued ongoing investments in the future.
truist financial corporation 33
the company's operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt the company's business and adversely impact the company's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.
the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout the company's business and, as a result of the company's interactions with and reliance on third parties, is not limited to the company's own internal operational functions. the company's operational and security systems and infrastructure, including computer systems, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to the company's performance. truist teammates and third parties may expose the company to risk as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, or a failure or breach of systems and infrastructure. for example, the company's ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions, including to third parties with whom the company interacts with or relies upon.
natural disasters and other catastrophic events could have a material adverse impact on the company's operations or the company's financial condition and results.
the occurrence of catastrophic weather events or pandemics could adversely affect the company's financial condition or results of operations. truist has significant operations and clients along the gulf and atlantic coasts as well as other regions of the u.s., which could be adversely impacted by hurricanes, tornadoes and other severe weather in those areas. truist's clients could also be disrupted by the physical effects of climate change, which may become more frequent and intense. natural and other types of disasters, including as a result of climate change, could have an adverse impact on truist's businesses in that such events could materially disrupt the company's operations or the ability or willingness of the company's clients to access the financial services offered, including adverse impacts on the company's borrowers to timely repay their loans and the value of any collateral held. these events could reduce the company's earnings and cause volatility in the company's financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations.
although truist has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, the company's operations and communications may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events and there can be no assurance that such business continuity plans will be effective.
truist may be impacted by the soundness of other financial institutions.
the company's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. truist has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, central counterparties, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional investors and clients. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally, in the past have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by truist or by other institutions. many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of the company's counterparty or client. in addition, the company's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by truist cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the company's exposure. any such losses could materially and adversely affect the company's results of operations and financial condition.
truist depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, truist relies on the completeness and accuracy of representations made by and information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. if the information provided is not accurate or complete, the company's decisions about extending credit or entering into other transactions with clients or counterparties could be adversely affected and the company could suffer defaults, credit losses or other negative consequences as a result.
the company's accounting policies and processes are critical to how it reports the company's financial condition and results of operations. they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.
accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the company's assets or liabilities and financial results. several of the company's accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. if assumptions or estimates underlying the company's financial statements are incorrect or are adjusted periodically, the company may experience material losses.
34 truist financial corporation management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management's judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. a variety of factors could affect the realization of income and expense or the recognition of assets and liabilities in the company's financial statements. truist has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. due to the uncertainty surrounding the company's judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, the company cannot guarantee that adjustments to accounting policies or restatement of prior period financial statements will not be required.
further, from time to time, the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company's financial statements. in addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond the company's control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how the company reports its financial results and condition. in some cases, the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.
depressed market values for the company's stock and adverse economic conditions sustained over a period of time may require the company to write down all or some portion of the company's goodwill.
goodwill is periodically tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount, then the reporting unit's goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. the fair value of a reporting unit is impacted by the reporting unit's expected financial performance and susceptibility to adverse economic, regulatory and legislative changes. future adverse changes in economic conditions or expected financial performance may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to be below its carrying amount, resulting in goodwill impairment. the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units are assessed for reasonableness by reviewing a variety of indicators, including comparing these estimated fair values to the company's market capitalization over a reasonable period of time. while this comparison provides some relative market information about the estimated fair value of the reporting units, it is not determinative and needs to be evaluated in the context of the current economic environment. however, significant and sustained declines in the company's market capitalization could be an indication of potential goodwill impairment. refer to the "critical accounting policies" section for additional details related to the company's intangible assets policy.
certain banking laws and certain provisions of the company's articles of incorporation may have an anti-takeover effect.
provisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire the company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the company's owners. acquisition of certain amounts of any class of voting stock of a bhc or depository institution, including shares of the company's common stock, may create a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer "controls" the bhc or depository institution and thus, unless the acquirer is able to rebut this presumption, it would be subject to various laws and regulations applicable to a bhc. also, a bhc must obtain the prior approval of the frb before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including truist bank.
there also are provisions in the company's amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, such as limitations on the ability to call a special meeting of the company's shareholders, that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. in addition, the company's board will be authorized under the company's amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue shares of the company's preferred stock and to determine the rights, terms, conditions and privileges of such preferred stock, without shareholder approval. these provisions may effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination.
technology risks the company faces cybersecurity risks, including denial of service, hacking and social engineering attacks that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect the company's operations or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure.
the company's computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties are frequently targeted in cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, malware intrusion, data corruption attempts, terrorist activities or identity theft. the company's business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in the company's information systems and that of third parties. in addition, to access the company's network, products and services, the company's clients and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of the company's network environment and can introduce added cybersecurity risks.
truist financial corporation 35
truist and truist's clients, regulators and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. cyber-attacks may expose security vulnerabilities in the company's systems or the systems of third parties or other security measures that could result in the unauthorized gathering, monitoring, misuse, release, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary or sensitive information. a cyber-attack could also damage the company's systems by introducing material disruptions to the company's or the company's clients' or other third parties' network access or business operations. as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance the company's protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. despite efforts to ensure the integrity of the company's systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, the company may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may the company be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches, which may result in material losses or consequences to truist.
cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to facilitate and conduct financial transactions. for example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as truist continues to expand its mobile-payment and internet-based product offerings and expand the company's internal usage of web-based products and applications. in addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled teammates or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time and motive. the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, and may not be recognized until launched or well after a breach has occurred. in addition, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third party vendors with access to the company's data may not be disclosed in a timely manner.
the company also faces indirect technology, cybersecurity and other operational risks relating to clients and other third parties that the company relies upon to facilitate or enable business activities, including, financial counterparties, regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. in addition, truist faces cybersecurity and other operational risks relating to the merger, including increased phishing attacks on teammates, increased network perimeter scanning by attackers searching for vulnerabilities and domain name squatting. further, as a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants. this consolidation, interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. any third party technology failure, cyber-attack, other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect the company's ability to conduct transactions, service the company's clients, manage the company's exposure to risk or expand the company's business.
the public perception that a cyber-attack on the company's systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage the company's reputation with clients and third parties with whom the company does business. hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences, including loss of clients and business opportunities; costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant disruption to the company's operations and business; misappropriation, exposure or destruction of the company's confidential information, intellectual property, funds and those of the company's clients; or damage to the company's or the company's clients' or third parties' computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws. this could result in litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties, loss of confidence in the company's security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. in addition, the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.
truist will continually encounter technological change and must effectively develop and implement new technology.
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. truist has invested in technology and connectivity to automate functions previously performed manually, to facilitate the ability of clients to engage in financial transactions and otherwise to enhance the client experience with respect to the company's products and services. truist expects to make additional investments in innovation and technology to address technological disruption in the industry and improve client offerings and service. these changes allow the company to better serve the company's clients and to reduce costs.
36 truist financial corporation the company's continued success depends, in part, upon the company's ability to address clients' needs by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy client demands, including demands for faster and more secure payment services, to create efficiencies in the company's operations and to integrate those offerings with legacy platforms or to update those legacy platforms. a failure to maintain or enhance the company's competitive position with respect to technology, whether because of a failure to anticipate client expectations, a failure in the performance of technological developments or an untimely roll out of developments, may cause the company to lose market share or incur additional expense.

executive overview despite the challenges truist and its clients faced in 2020, significant progress was made on integration and conversion efforts during the year. below is an overview on progress in a few key areas.
integration efforts truist completed the merger on december 6, 2019, and made significant progress on integration and conversion efforts in 2020. some milestones include unveiling truist's purpose, mission, and values; launching the truist brand and visual identity; completing the purchase of truist center, the new corporate headquarters in charlotte, nc; launching truist social media platforms; announcing brand conversions for several business units including truist insurance, truist securities, and truist leadership institute; launching truist foundation and truist ventures; beginning early migrations for the mortgage business; and introducing the blended branch program. recent highlights include:

•executed numerous corporate function integration activities across audit, risk, legal and finance.
•truist reaffirmed its commitment to achieving $1.6 billion in net cost saves on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of 2022.
supporting clients truist acted swiftly to support clients, teammates and communities in response to the covid-19 pandemic last year and continues to support these stakeholders. truist is actively helping clients impacted by covid-19, providing payment relief assistance for credit cards, personal loans, auto loans, home equity lines of credit, and residential mortgages. truist was one of the largest lenders of ppp loans in 2020 and remains committed to helping small businesses get access to emergency funds for first and second-draw ppp loans. truist is working closely with clients, providing resources and guidance to ensure a smooth and efficient experience from application to funding and forgiveness. the carrying value of ppp loans was $11.0 billion as of december 31, 2020.

key challenges truist's business is dynamic and complex. consequently, management annually evaluates and, as necessary, adjusts the company's business strategy in the context of the current operating environment. during this process, management considers the current financial condition and performance of the company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective. achieving key strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges. in the opinion of management, the following challenges are the most likely to impact truist's near to medium term performance:
•activating the company's culture of striving to make life better for clients, teammates and stakeholders;
•achieving the benefits from the merger, including anticipated synergies and cost savings;
•managing the integration of systems and operations, while safeguarding the company against external threats;
•executing the company's "t3 strategy" by focusing on personal touch and technology to engender trust and provide distinctive, secure and successful client experiences;
•driving innovation and remaining attuned to evolving client preferences to succeed in an intensely competitive environment;
•onboarding and retaining key personnel while maintaining safety protocols to protect clients, teammates and communities; and
•navigating economic risks and actively managing credit exposures impacted by the covid-19 pandemic.
in addition, certain other challenges and unforeseen events could have a near term impact on truist's financial condition and results of operations. see the sections titled "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" for additional examples of such challenges.
analysis of results of operations net interest income and nim
2020 compared to 2019
the net interest margin was 3.22% for the year ended december 31, 2020, down 20 basis points compared to the earlier period. average earning assets increased $217.2 billion, which primarily reflects a $152.9 billion increase in average total loans and leases, a $32.6 billion increase in average securities, a $28.4 billion increase in average other earning assets and a $3.4 billion increase in interest earning trading assets. average interest-bearing liabilities increased $153.7 billion. average interest-bearing deposits increased $131.0 billion, average long-term debt increased $21.0 billion and average short-term borrowings increased $1.7 billion. the significant increases in earnings assets and liabilities are primarily due to the merger, as well as impacts from the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting government stimulus programs.
the yield on the total loan portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2020 was 4.33%, down 66 basis points compared to the earlier period, reflecting the impact of rate decreases and deferred interest for loans granted an accommodation in connection with covid-19, partially offset by purchase accounting accretion from merged loans. the yield on the average securities portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2020 was 2.09%, down 53 basis points compared to the earlier period primarily due to lower yields on new purchases and higher premium amortization. the average cost of total deposits was 0.22%, down 42 basis points compared to the earlier period. the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.32%, down 61 basis points compared to the earlier period. the average rate on short-term borrowings was 1.35%, down 99 basis points compared to the earlier period. the average rate on long-term debt was 1.75%, down 147 basis points compared to the earlier period. the lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower rate environment. the lower rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt and the issuance of new long-term debt.
as of december 31, 2020, the remaining unamortized fair value marks on the loan and lease portfolio, deposits and long-term debt were $2.4 billion, $19 million and $216 million, respectively. the remaining unamortized fair value mark on loans and leases consists of $1.1 billion for commercial loans and leases and $1.3 billion for consumer loans and leases. these amounts will be recognized over the remaining contractual lives of the underlying instruments or as paydowns occur.

truist financial corporation 45
provision for credit losses
2020 compared to 2019
the provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion, compared to $615 million for the earlier period. the increase in the provision for credit losses reflects the significant builds to the allowance for credit losses in the first and second quarters of the year due to increased economic stress associated with the pandemic and specific consideration of its impact on certain industries, as well as uncertainty related to performance after the expiration of relief packages and covid-19, increased loan balances arising from the merger and the effect of applying the cecl methodology in the current period compared to the incurred loss methodology in the earlier period.
net charge-offs for the year ended december 31, 2020 were $1.1 billion, compared to $634 million for the earlier period. higher net charge-offs also contributed to the increase in the provision for credit losses and primarily reflect increases as a result of the merger. the net charge-off rate of 0.36% for the year ended december 31, 2020 was down four basis points compared to the earlier period.
noninterest income noninterest income is a significant contributor to truist's financial results. management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce truist's reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

2020 compared to 2019
noninterest income for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased $3.6 billion compared to the earlier period. the current period includes $402 million of net securities gains primarily from the sale of non-agency mbs in the second quarter of 2020 and agency mbs in the third quarter of 2020. the prior period includes $116 million of net securities losses from the sale of agency mbs. excluding the net securities gains and losses, noninterest income increased $3.1 billion, with nearly all categories of noninterest income being impacted by the merger. in addition to the impacts from the merger, insurance income increased $121 million due to strong production and acquisitions. service charges on deposits were up despite reduced overdraft incident rates and increased refunds and waivers to support clients impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. residential mortgage banking income was up due to strong production and refinance activity driven by the lower rate environment, partially offset by lower valuations of the mortgage servicing rights and increased amortization driven by higher prepayments speeds. investment banking and trading income was up, but was negatively impacted by credit valuation adjustments on the derivatives portfolio primarily related to the decline in interest rates and widening of credit spreads.

2020 compared to 2019
noninterest expense for the year ended december 31, 2020 was up $7.0 billion compared to the earlier period. merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the merger increased $500 million and $370 million, respectively. in addition, the current period was impacted by $235 million of losses on the early extinguishment of long-term debt and a $50 million charitable contribution to the truist charitable fund. excluding the items mentioned above and the impact of an increase of $521 million of amortization expense for intangibles, noninterest expense increased $5.3 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. in addition to the impacts of the merger, operating costs were elevated due to covid-19, which resulted in approximately $250 million of expenses compared to the earlier period. this was primarily related to additional on-site pay and bonuses for certain teammates, net occupancy costs for enhanced cleaning and teammate support expenses. additionally, personnel expenses increased as a result of the completion of a post-merger reevaluation of job grades that resulted in additional salaries, incentives and equity-based compensation expenses.
merger-related and restructuring charges truist has incurred certain merger-related and restructuring charges, which include:
•severance and personnel-related costs or credits;
•occupancy and equipment charges or credits, which relate to costs or gains associated with lease terminations, obsolete equipment write-offs and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment;
•professional services, which relate to legal and investment banking advisory fees and other consulting services pertaining to restructuring initiatives or transactions;
•systems conversion and related charges, which represent costs to integrate the entity's information technology systems;
•other merger-related and restructuring charges or credits, which include expenses necessary to convert and combine the acquired branches and operations of merged companies, direct media advertising related to the mergers and acquisitions, asset and supply inventory write-offs, and other similar charges; and
•write-offs related to exiting certain businesses.
merger-related and restructuring accruals are established when the costs are incurred or once all requirements for a plan to dispose of or outsource certain business functions have been approved by management. merger and restructuring accruals are re-evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary. the remaining accruals at december 31, 2020 are generally expected to be utilized within one year, unless they relate to specific contracts that expire later.
the 2020 merger-related and restructuring costs primarily reflect higher charges as a result of the merger, including costs for severance and other benefits and costs related to exiting facilities, while the 2019 costs primarily reflect branch closures and other restructuring initiatives.

lending activities truist strives to meet the credit needs of its clients while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth and loan quality. management believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong client relationships over time and developing in-depth local market knowledge. the company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of risk assumed and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and geographical concentration.
truist lends to a diverse client base that is geographically dispersed to mitigate concentration risk arising from local and regional economic downturns. international loans were immaterial as of december 31, 2020 and 2019. the following discussion provides additional information on the company's loan and lease portfolios. refer to the "risk management" section for a discussion of the credit risk management policies used to manage the portfolios.
commercial loan and lease portfolio commercial loans and leases represent the largest category of the company's loan and lease portfolio. commercial community banking generally targets small-to-middle market businesses with annual sales between $2 million and $500 million, while cib provides lending solutions to large commercial clients. the commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of lending to public and private business clients and is composed of commercial and industrial, owner occupied, equipment leasing and financing and commercial real estate, as well as government and institutional financing.
truist financial corporation 51
in accordance with the company's lending policy, each commercial loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process. commercial loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate, libor, or sofr and are individually monitored and reviewed for deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. the majority of truist's commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories and other types of collateral.
residential mortgage loan portfolio truist bank offers various types of fixed and adjustable-rate loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential properties. truist primarily originates conforming mortgage loans and higher quality jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for owner-occupied properties. conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by fnma and fhlmc. they are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination, or have mortgage insurance as required by investors and are made to borrowers in good credit standing.
risks associated with mortgage lending include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage market and an effective msr hedging process. credit risk is managed through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance. the right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. management believes that the retention of mortgage servicing is a relationship driver in retail banking and a part of management's strategy to establish long-term client relationships and offer high quality client service. truist also purchases residential mortgage loans from correspondent originators. the loans purchased from third party originators are subject to substantially the same underwriting and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally.
residential home equity and direct loan portfolio the residential home equity and direct loan portfolio is composed of a wide variety of secured and unsecured loans offered through truist's branch network, as well as loans originated by lightstream, truist's national online consumer lending division. loans originated through the truist branch network include revolving home equity lines of credit secured by first or second liens on residential real estate and certain other secured and unsecured lending marketed to qualifying clients and other creditworthy candidates in truist's market areas. lightstream provides fixed-rate, unsecured lending to consumers with strong credit through its proprietary online loan origination system.
indirect auto loan portfolio the indirect auto portfolio primarily includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles. the indirect auto portfolio also includes nonprime and near prime automobile finance. such loans are originated through approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the truist market area and nationally through regional acceptance corporation. these loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. indirect auto loans are subject to rigorous lending policies and procedures and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that are consistent with the company's risk philosophy. in addition to its normal underwriting due diligence, truist uses application systems and scoring systems to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its indirect auto portfolio.
indirect other loan portfolio the indirect other portfolio includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used boats and recreational vehicles. the indirect other portfolio also includes small ticket consumer lending related to the purchase of power sports equipment. these loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. these loans are subject to similar rigorous lending policies and procedures as the indirect auto loan portfolio. the indirect other loan portfolio also includes other indirect lending to consumers to finance home improvements, furniture purchases, and certain elective health-care services. these loans are originated in accordance with strict underwriting criteria as determined by truist.
student loan portfolio the student loan portfolio is composed of government guaranteed student loans and certain private student loans originated by third parties. the government guarantee mitigates substantially all of the risk related to principal and interest repayment for this component of the portfolio. private student loans were purchased from third party originators with credit enhancements that partially mitigate the company's credit exposure.
52 truist financial corporation credit card loan portfolio the credit card portfolio consists of the outstanding balances on credit cards. truist markets credit cards to its existing client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing. such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed.
pci prior to the adoption of cecl, the pci balance included loans acquired with credit deterioration subsequent to origination as well as loans that were formerly covered by loss sharing agreements. in connection with the adoption of cecl, all loans previously in the pci portfolio became pcd loans and were transferred to their respective portfolios.

loans and leases hfi were $299.7 billion at december 31, 2020, down $108 million compared to 2019.
commercial loans increased $7.3 billion during 2020. the growth in the commercial portfolio was primarily in commercial and industrial loans and reflects ppp loan originations, which was partially offset by lower utilization of commercial lines. truist served as the fourth largest ppp lender in 2020. the carrying value of ppp loans was $11.0 billion as of december 31, 2020. additionally, within the commercial and industrial portfolio, truist experienced growth in loans from mortgage warehouse lending due to the decline in rates and increased refinance activity. growth in commercial portfolios was partially offset by a decline in dealer floor plan lending and the transfer of $1.0 billion of certain loans and leases to held for sale related to the decision to exit a small ticket loan and lease portfolio.
consumer loans decreased $3.2 billion during 2020 primarily due to refinance activity resulting in a decline in residential mortgages and residential home equity and direct loans. this was partially offset by an increase in indirect auto due to expanded client offerings and an improving credit environment.
credit card loans decreased $780 million during 2020 due to lower business and consumer spending as a result of covid-19.
lhfs decreased $2.3 billion during 2020 primarily due to the sale of loans that had been placed in lhfs after the close of the merger and the branch divestiture in connection with the merger, partially offset by the transfer of $1.0 billion to lhfs due to the decision to exit a small ticket loan and lease portfolio.

the following table presents a summary of the commercial loan portfolio, segregated by contractual maturities and interest rate terms. determinations of maturities are based on contractual terms. truist's credit policy typically does not permit automatic renewal of loans. at the scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the client generally must request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions negotiated at that time.

average loans and leases held for investment for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $302.9 billion, down $7.6 billion compared to the third quarter of 2020.
average commercial loans decreased $5.4 billion, primarily in commercial and industrial loans due to paydowns on commercial lines. this was partially offset by growth in mortgage warehouse lending, dealer floor plan lending and governmental finance loans. the carrying value of ppp loans was down $1.4 billion compared to september 30, 2020, which resulted in a decline of $304 million in average ppp loans compared to the average for the third quarter of 2020. in addition, average commercial loans were impacted by the transfer of $1.0 billion of certain loans and leases to held for sale, which resulted in a decline in the average balance of $323 million compared to the third quarter of 2020.
average consumer loans decreased $2.2 billion primarily due to seasonally lower loan production and refinance activity resulting in a decline in residential mortgages and residential home equity and direct loans. this was partially offset by an increase in indirect auto loans.

(1)the past due status of loans that received a deferral under the cares act is generally frozen during the deferral period.
56 truist financial corporation nonperforming assets totaled $1.4 billion at december 31, 2020, up $703 million compared to december 31, 2019 primarily from the adoption of cecl, which resulted in the discontinuation of the pool-level accounting for pci loans and replaced that with a loan-level evaluation for nonaccrual status. as of december 31, 2019, there was approximately $500 million of pci loans that would have been classified as nonperforming had the company evaluated accrual status on a loan level basis. the remaining increase in nonperforming loans held for investment is primarily in commercial and industrial loans and an increase in nonperforming mortgage loans due to loans exiting certain accommodation programs related to the cares act. nonperforming loans and leases represented 0.44% of total loans and leases, up 26 basis points compared to december 31, 2019.
performing tdrs were up $381 million compared to the prior year primarily in residential mortgage, lease financing and indirect auto loans. this increase primarily reflects the application of acquisition accounting related to the merger, which resulted in the removal of the tdr designation on all loans that were restructured by suntrust prior to the merger date.
loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $2.0 billion at december 31, 2020, relatively flat compared to the prior year. in connection with the discontinuation of pool level accounting for pci loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing decreased as loan-level evaluations resulted in certain loans being placed in nonaccrual status. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in government guaranteed student loans. additionally, residential mortgage loans 90 days or more past due increased primarily due to the repurchase of delinquent government guaranteed loans. the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.67% at december 31, 2020, an increase of 1 basis point from the prior year. excluding government guaranteed and pci loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.04% at december 31, 2020, up 1 basis point from december 31, 2019.
loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing totaled $2.2 billion at december 31, 2020, relatively flat compared to the prior year. loans 30-89 days past due reflects a decrease in pci loans, offset by a corresponding increase in the portfolios where these loans were transferred in connection with the implementation of cecl. the ratio of loans 30-89 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.74% at december 31, 2020, flat compared to the prior year.
problem loans include npls and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing as disclosed in table 22. in addition, for the commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans. refer to "note 5. loans and acl" for additional disclosures related to these potential problem loans.

tdrs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term and a concession has been granted to the borrower. as a result, truist works with borrowers to prevent further difficulties and to improve the likelihood of recovery on a loan. to facilitate this process, a concessionary modification that would not otherwise be considered may be granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a tdr. in accordance with the cares act, truist implemented loan modification programs in response to the covid-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. payment relief assistance provided by truist includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. the company adopted certain provisions of the cares act and other regulatory guidance that provide relief from the requirement to apply tdr accounting to (1) certain modifications of federally backed mortgages upon request from the borrower, and (2) certain modifications of other non-federally backed mortgages for borrowers impacted by the covid-19 pandemic that were less than 30 days past due at december 31, 2019. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for truist's policy related to tdrs and covid-19 loan modifications.
tdrs identified by suntrust prior to the merger date are not included in truist's tdr disclosure because all such loans were recorded at fair value and a new accounting basis was established as of the merger date. subsequent modifications are evaluated for potential treatment as tdrs in accordance with truist's accounting policies.

the acl totaled $6.2 billion at december 31, 2020, compared to $1.9 billion at december 31, 2019. the increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due to the adoption of cecl. upon adoption, the company recorded a $3.1 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses, including $2.8 billion that was charged to retained earnings before tax, and $378 million related to the gross up for pcd loans. the remaining increase in the allowance for credit losses primarily reflects deteriorated economic conditions. as of december 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.95% of loans and leases held for investment. the allowance for credit losses includes $5.8 billion for loans and leases and $364 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments.
at december 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 4.39 times nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 3.41 times at december 31, 2019. at december 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 5.21 times annualized net charge-offs, compared to 2.44 times at december 31, 2019.
60 truist financial corporation net charge-offs during 2020 totaled $1.1 billion, up $485 million compared to the prior year. the increase in net charge-offs primarily reflects the merger. as a percentage of average loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs were 0.36%, down four basis points compared to the prior year. current year net charge-offs include $97 million of charge-offs related to the implementation of cecl, which required a gross-up of loan carrying values in connection with the establishment of an allowance on pcd loans. management performed a comprehensive review of pcd assets during the year and concluded in certain situations that a charge-off was required. excluding these additional charge-offs, net charge-offs would have been an annualized 0.33% of average loans and leases for 2020, down seven basis points compared to the prior year.
the following table presents an allocation of the alll. the entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans and leases.

truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary alll. truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. when notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. these valuations are updated at least annually thereafter.
truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by truist. as a result, using migration assumptions that are based on historical experience and adjusted for current trends, truist estimates the volume of second lien positions where the first lien is delinquent and adjusts the alll to reflect the increased risk of loss on these credits. finally, truist also provides additional reserves for second lien positions when the estimated combined current loan to value ratio for the credit exceeds 100%. as of december 31, 2020, truist held or serviced the first lien on 30.6% of its second lien positions.

funding activities deposits are the primary source of funds for the company's lending and investing activities. scheduled payments and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also provide a stable source of funds. fhlb advances, other secured borrowings, federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. funding activities are monitored and governed through truist's overall alm process under the governance and oversight of the mrlcc, which is further discussed in the "market risk management" section in md&a. the following section provides a brief description of the various sources of funds.
deposits deposits are obtained principally from individuals and businesses within truist's branch network and include noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, cds and iras. deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules. interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) competitor deposit rates, (ii) the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost.

average deposits for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $375.3 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion compared to the prior quarter. average noninterest-bearing and interest checking deposit growth was strong for the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by anticipated seasonal inflows in addition to continued growth resulting from pandemic-related client behavior. average time deposits decreased primarily due to maturity of wholesale negotiable certificates of deposit and higher-cost personal and business accounts.
average noninterest-bearing deposits represented 33.9% of total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to 33.3% for the prior quarter. the cost of average total deposits was 0.07% for the fourth quarter, down three basis points compared to the prior quarter. the cost of average interest-bearing deposits was 0.11% for the fourth quarter, down four basis points compared to the prior quarter.

at december 31, 2020, short-term borrowings totaled $6.1 billion, a decrease of $12.1 billion compared to december 31, 2019, due primarily to a decrease of $10.8 billion in short-term fhlb advances. these borrowing sources were replaced with deposit funding.
truist financial corporation 63
average short-term borrowings were $10.1 billion, or 2.4% of total funding for 2020, as compared to $8.5 billion, or 4.1% for the prior year. the increase in the average amount was due to the merger. average short-term borrowings decreased as a percentage of funding sources due to strong deposit growth.
long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by truist and truist bank. long-term debt totaled $39.6 billion at december 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.7 billion compared to december 31, 2019. during 2020, the company issued $4.8 billion of senior notes with interest rates from 1.125% to 1.95% maturing in 2023 to 2030, $500 million in floating rate senior notes maturing in 2023 and $1.3 billion of subordinated notes with an interest rate of 2.25% maturing in 2030. these issuances were partially offset by the redemption of $4.6 billion of senior notes during 2020 and a decrease of $3.3 billion in long-term fhlb advances. fhlb advances represented 2.2% of total outstanding long-term debt at december 31, 2020, compared to 10.0% at december 31, 2019. the average cost of long-term debt was 1.75% for the year ended december 31, 2020, down 147 basis points compared to the same period in 2019. truist entered into $20 billion of fhlb advances during 2020 to build liquidity and ensure the company was able to meet the funding needs of its clients. as market conditions stabilized and deposits increased, these advances were repaid and the company recognized a loss of $235 million on the early extinguishment of debt. the repayment of these advances improved net interest income, the net interest margin and the leverage ratios.
shareholders' equity total shareholders' equity was $70.9 billion at december 31, 2020, an increase of $4.4 billion from december 31, 2019. this increase includes the gross issuance of $3.5 billion of preferred stock during the year, $4.5 billion in net income available to common shareholders and an increase of $1.6 billion in aoci, which was partially offset by $2.1 billion related to the adoption of cecl and $2.7 billion for common and preferred dividends. in addition, truist redeemed $500 million of its series k preferred stock during 2020. truist's book value per common share at december 31, 2020 was $46.52, compared to $45.66 at december 31, 2019.

risk management truist maintains a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations. the company's risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite.
truist has developed and employs a risk taxonomy that further guides business functions in identifying, measuring, responding to, monitoring and reporting on possible exposures to the organization. the risk taxonomy drives internal risk conversations and enables truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the company faces, both presently and in the future, and the company's position on managing it to acceptable levels.
truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization. all teammates are responsible for upholding the company's purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the company's culture. the truist code of ethics guides the company's decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance.
truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital.
compensation decisions take into account a teammate's adherence to, and successful implementation of, truist's risk values and associated policies and procedures. the company's compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior.
truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the risks associated with integrating heritage bb&t and heritage suntrust. the board and executive leadership oversee the change management program, which is designed to ensure key decisions are reviewed and that there is appropriate oversight of integration activities.
truist's purpose, mission and values are the foundation for the risk management framework utilized at truist and therefore serve as the basis on which the risk appetite and risk strategy are built. truist's rmo provides independent oversight and guidance for risk-taking across the enterprise. in keeping with the belief that consistent values drive long-term behaviors, truist's rmo has established the following risk values which guide teammates' day-to-day activities:
64 truist financial corporation
•managing risk is the responsibility of every teammate.
•proactively identifying risk and managing the inherent risks of their businesses is the responsibility of the business units.
•managing risk with a balanced approach which includes quality, profitability, and growth.
•measuring what is managed and managing what is measured.
•utilizing sound and consistent risk management practices.
•thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and qualitatively.
•realizing lower cost of capital from high quality risk management.
truist places significant emphasis on risk management oversight and maintains a separate board-level risk committee, which assists the board in its oversight of the company's risk management function. the committee is responsible for approving and periodically reviewing the company's risk management framework and risk management policies as well as monitoring the company's risk profile, approving risk appetite statements, and providing input to management regarding truist's risk appetite and risk profile.
the rmo is led by the cro and is responsible for overseeing the identification, measurement, monitoring, management and reporting of risk. the cro has direct access to the board to communicate any risk issues (current or emerging) as well as the performance of the risk management activities throughout the enterprise.
as illustrated below, the risk management framework is supported by three lines of defense. the following figure describes the roles of the three lines of defense:
truist's risk governance framework is designed to provide comprehensive board and executive leadership risk oversight, maintaining a committee governance structure that is designed to ensure alignment and execution of the risk management framework. the committee structure provides a mechanism to allow for efficient aggregation and escalation of risk information from the bus up to the risk programs, executive leadership and ultimately the board.
truist financial corporation 65
the executive level committees include the erc, ecrpmc, mrlcc, ebpcc, tmc and dc, each of which is chaired by a member of executive leadership. these committees provide oversight of each of the primary risk types.
the erc establishes a fully integrated view of risks across the company, provides broad strategic oversight of all risk types, and oversees corporate-wide strategies for identifying, assessing, controlling, measuring, monitoring and reporting risk at the enterprise level.
the erc is responsible for maintaining an effective risk management framework and monitoring its adoption and execution across the enterprise. the erc is chaired by the cro and its membership includes all members of executive leadership and the general auditor.
the principal types of inherent risk include market, credit, liquidity, compliance, strategic, reputational, operational and technology risks. the following is a discussion of these risks.
market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. market risk results from changes in the level, volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices.
effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truist's strategic financial objectives. truist's most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility risk in truist's bus. interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk).
the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. at truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide ipv function.
66 truist financial corporation interest rate market risk as a financial institution, truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities. since interest rate changes are out of the control of any private sector institution, truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities, taking into account the volumes, maturities and mix, with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible. truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk: (i) simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates; (ii) analysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and (iii) analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates.
the company's simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends, using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans, as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates. these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truist's assets and liabilities. the model also considers truist's current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes and projected growth and/or contractions, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance.
deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process. truist applies an average deposit beta (the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes) of approximately 50% to its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity. non-maturity, interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables, including noninterest-bearing deposits, to determine the impact these variables could have on the company's interest rate risk position. the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions, but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk.
the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next 12 months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below.

(1)the down 25 and 50 rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect down 25 and 50 basis points for all rate indices.
truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the board. the following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered truist's primary measures of interest rate risk:
•maximum impact on net interest income of 7.5% for the next 12 months assuming a 25 basis point change in interest rates each quarter for four quarters; and a
•maximum impact on net interest income of 10% for an immediate 100 basis point parallel change in rates.
this interest rate shock analysis is designed to create an outer bound of acceptable interest rate risk.
management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle. much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. consistent with the industry, truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source. the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist. a decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truist's balance sheet because the company would increase interest-bearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source.
the following table shows the results of truist's interest-rate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios. for purposes of this analysis, truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at 100%.

(1)the base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at december 31, 2020 as presented in the preceding table.
truist also uses an eve analysis to focus on longer-term projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates. this measure allows truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period. the eve model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments. the difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as eve.
the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on eve:

truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities, commercial loans, msrs and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. during october 2020, truist initiated a new investment securities fair value hedging program, using fixed interest rate swaps to hedge prepayable securities. truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities. as of december 31, 2020, truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $322.9 billion, with an associated net fair value of $3.3 billion. see "note 19. derivative financial instruments" for additional disclosures.
libor in its current form was anticipated to no longer be available after 2021. for most tenors of u.s. dollar libor, subject to the results of a consultation period ending january 2021, the administrator of libor is considering extending publication until june 30, 2023. tenors used infrequently by truist, including one week and two month u.s. dollar libor, are still anticipated to cease publication at december 31, 2021, based on this new guidance. truist has u.s. dollar libor-based contracts that extend beyond june 30, 2023. to prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate, management has formed a cross-functional project team to address the libor transition. the project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index. the project team provides updates to executive leadership and the board.
contract fallback language for existing loans and leases is under review and certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition. current fallback language used for new, renewed, and modified contracts is generally consistent with arrc recommendations. updates to current fallback language will be evaluated according to new regulatory guidance for the extension of timelines for the transition and expectations for production of u.s. dollar libor contracts during 2021. truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments, systems implications, hedging strategies, and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness for the transition. market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions at transition. for a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of libor and the transition to alternative reference rates, refer to the section titled "item1a. risk factors." in 2020, truist began offering sofr-based lending solutions to wholesale and consumer clients, and entered into sofr-based derivative contracts. truist expects sofr to become a more commonly-used pricing benchmark across the industry. truist continues to evaluate sofr for additional product offerings and other alternative reference rates as replacements for libor.
market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary, truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets, which generate market risks. trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using var, stress testing and sensitivity analysis. risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level, which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truist's risk appetite.
truist is also subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule.
68 truist financial corporation covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements, or to lock in arbitrage profits. truist's trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the company's clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. the trading portfolio, measured in terms of var, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives and (iv) equity derivatives. as a market maker across different asset classes, truist's trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures.
valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies exist for all covered positions. additionally, trading positions are subject to independent price verification. see "note 19. derivative financial instruments," "note 18. fair value disclosures," and "critical accounting policies" herein for discussion of valuation policies, procedures and methodologies.
securitizations as of december 31, 2020, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was not material. consistent with the market risk rule requirements, the company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. securitization positions are subject to truist's comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. there were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period.
correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of december 31, 2020.
var-based measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. prior to the integration of the two institutional broker dealer businesses to form truist securities in the third quarter of 2020, truist operated two historical var models and the aggregate company-wide var across the systems was determined additively with no benefit of diversification. the heritage bb&t var model was retired following the formation of truist securities. following the formation of truist securities, var is calculated on a consolidated basis using the truist var engine. for risk management purposes, the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. for market risk rule purposes, the company calculates var using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. due to inherent limitations of the var methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits.
the trading portfolio's var profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility and the correlation between different positions. a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios, because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. the following table summarizes certain var-based measures for both the three and twelve months ended december 31, 2020 and 2019. the increase from the prior year was mainly due to the integration of the heritage suntrust trading business and the market volatility due to the covid-19 pandemic. as illustrated in the tables below, the inclusion of volatility levels observed in march 2020 in the 12-month var historic look-back window led to a convergence between var and stressed var measures.

the increase from the prior year in stressed var-based measures was due to the integration of heritage suntrust trading business after the merger and the market volatility due to the covid-19 pandemic.
specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g. default, event risks). the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. as such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply.
var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule, the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily var-based measures generated by the model.
there were seven company-wide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, primarily driven by the covid-19 pandemic, which led to a sudden and significant repricing of instruments in financial markets during the first and second quarters of 2020, as well as an increase in market volatility and deterioration in overall market liquidity. in accordance with established policy and procedure, all company-wide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance. following such reviews, truist determined that the var model performed in line with expectations and that the significant moves in underlying market risk factors caused by the covid-19 pandemic would not typically have been captured within the 1-day var measure.
70 truist financial corporation model risk management mrm is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mrm policy, which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis. as part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and to identify potential model enhancement.
stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting. the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. all trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the company's comprehensive stress testing framework. management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. management also utilizes stress analyses to support the company's capital adequacy assessment standards. see the "capital" section of this md&a for additional discussion of capital adequacy.
credit risk credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default, inability or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation to truist or otherwise perform as agreed. credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty. credit risk arises when truist funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether on or off-balance sheet. credit risk increases when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds deteriorates.
truist has established the following general practices to manage credit risk:
•limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower;
•establishing a process for credit approval accountability;
•careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks;
•ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships;
•continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and
•periodically reevaluating the company's strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions change.

the following discussion describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of truist's lending function.
underwriting approach the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk; therefore, proper loan underwriting is critical to truist's long-term financial success. truist's underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that promote credit relationships that conform to truist's risk philosophy. provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals:
•cash flow and debt service coverage - cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower's cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary repayment sources.
•secondary sources of repayment - alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as they are liquid, can be easily accessed, and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source.
•value of any underlying collateral - loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrower's normal cash flows.
•overall creditworthiness of the client, taking into account the client's relationships, both past and current, with truist and other lenders - truist's success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background.
•level of equity invested in the transaction - in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances.
refer to the "lending activities" section in this md&a for a discussion of each loan and lease portfolio.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that (i) truist will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or (ii) truist cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (market liquidity risk).
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. this risk exposes truist to fines, civil monetary penalties, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. compliance risk can result in diminished reputation, reduced franchise or enterprise value, limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential.
strategic risk strategic risk is the risk of financial loss, diminished stakeholder confidence, or negative impact to human capital resulting from ineffective strategy setting and execution, adverse business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. truist is committed to fulfilling its overall strategic objectives by selecting business strategies and operating businesses in a manner consistent with achieving profitability/earnings growth and maintaining strong confidence and trust with its key stakeholder constituencies.
reputation risk reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, enterprise value, the truist brand, and public confidence arising from negative publicity or public opinion, whether real or perceived, regarding truist's business practices, products, services, transactions, or other activities undertaken by truist, its representatives, or its partners. a negative reputation may impair truist's relationship with clients, teammates, communities or shareholders, and it is often a residual risk that arises when other risks are not managed properly.
operational risk operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. it includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failure to adequately protect company-owned assets. an operational loss occurs when an event results in a loss or reserve originating from operational risk.
72 truist financial corporation model risk model risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. truist uses models for many purposes, including the valuation of financial positions, estimation of credit losses, and the measurement of risk. valuation models are used to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available. valuation models are also used as inputs for var, the estimation of var itself, regulatory capital, stress testing and the acl. models are owned by the applicable bus, who are responsible for the development, implementation and use of their models. oversight of these functions is performed by the mrm, which is a component of the rmo. once models have been approved, model owners are responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on a recurring basis. models are updated in response to changes in portfolio composition, industry and economic conditions, technological capabilities and other developments.
mrm manages model risk in a holistic manner through a suite of model governance and model validation activities. the risk of each model is assessed and classified into various risk tiers. additionally, mrm maintains an enterprise-wide model inventory containing relevant model information. regarding model validation, mrm utilizes internal validation analysts and managers with skill sets in predictive modeling to perform detailed reviews of model development, implementation and conceptual soundness. on certain occasions, the mrm will also engage external parties to assist with validation efforts. once in a production environment, mrm assesses a model's performance on a periodic basis through ongoing monitoring reviews. mrm tracks issues that have been identified during model validation or through ongoing monitoring, and engages with model owners to ensure their timely remediation. mrm gauges model risk utilizing a collection of key risk indicators, which are periodically reported to relevant committees, including but not limited to, the model risk management committee as well as the board risk committee. mrm will also present model risk topics to the board risk committee as necessary.
merger integration risk the truist merger program was designed to ensure successful integration following the merger through strong governance practices and controls, with processes, metrics and reporting exemplifying a strong risk culture. the core truist merger program structure consists of key stakeholders from each line of business. integration activities and risk mitigation are monitored through established workgroups and truist merger program leadership, with oversight and escalation into the merger oversight committee (as the primary committee), tmc and board technology committee.
technology risk technology risk is the business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information technology across the company. truist has defined and adopted a technology risk framework that provides the foundation for technology risk strategy, program and oversight and defines key objectives, operating model components, risk domains and capabilities to manage this risk.
digital technology is constantly evolving, and new and unforeseen threats and actions by others may disrupt operations or result in losses beyond truist's risk control thresholds. truist maintains a comprehensive risk-based information security / cybersecurity framework implemented through people, processes, and technology whereby truist actively monitors and evaluates threats, events, and the performance of its business operations and continually adapts its risk mitigation activities accordingly.
truist's framework aligns with those of the national institute of standards and technology, the international standards organization 27000 series, the it governance institute, and the control objectives for information and related technology, as well as conforms with the requirements and guidance from applicable regulatory authorities, including the federal financial institutions examination council. in addition, truist's framework, which includes internally and externally focused capabilities, drives the development and implementation of truist's holistic data security strategy that is designed to reduce risk while enabling truist's corporate business objectives.
truist has built an organization with dedicated, skilled talent to operationalize truist's cybersecurity strategy. the cybersecurity strategy is enabled by continuous enhancement of truist's multilayered defenses including advanced capabilities for early and rapid cyber threat identification, detection, protection, response, and recovery. truist participates in the federally recognized financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the financial services information sharing and analysis center as a key part of the company's cyber threat intelligence and response programs, as well as other industry organizations and initiatives that promote industry best practices such as harmonized cybersecurity standards, cyber readiness, and secure consumer financial data sharing.
to further mitigate the risks presented by an evolving cyber threat landscape, truist provides data protection guidance to clients and promotes data protection awareness and accountability through mandatory teammate training. truist conducts scenario-driven test exercises simulating impacts and consequences developed through analysis of real-world technology incidents as well as known and anticipated cyber threats. these exercises are designed to assess the viability of truist's crisis response and management programs and provide the basis for continuous improvement.
truist financial corporation 73
truist's cybersecurity risk program is overseen by executive leadership and the board. regular updates on the status of the cybersecurity risk program, including information security risks and incidents, emerging threats, and control environment, are aggregated and escalated to executive leadership and the board. additionally, truist has a cyber incident response team that manages significant cyber-specific events with escalation up to executive leadership and the board. truist's framework requires annual exercises at a minimum to test truist's preparedness. the board devotes significant time and attention to its oversight of cyber security risk and approves related information security policies. although truist has invested substantial resources to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk, it is not possible to completely eliminate this risk. truist obtains insurance that protects against certain losses, expenses, and damages associated with cybersecurity risk. see item 1a, "risk factors," for additional information regarding cybersecurity risk.
liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. in addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and afs securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale.
truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. in considering its liquidity position, management evaluates truist's funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding and national markets funding. in addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank. to ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities. as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, truist's liquid asset buffer, as a percent of total assets, was 20.2% and 16.5%, respectively.
the lcr rule directs large u.s. banking organizations to hold unencumbered high-quality liquid assets sufficient to withstand projected 30-day total net cash outflows, each as defined under the lcr rule. as of january 1, 2020, truist is subject to the category iii reduced lcr requirements. truist's average lcr was 113% for the three months ended december 31, 2020, well above the regulatory minimum of 100%.
parent company the parent company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. the parent company's assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with truist bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and notes receivable from subsidiaries. the principal obligations of the parent company are payments on long-term debt. the main sources of funds for the parent company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. the primary uses of funds by the parent company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, retirement of common stock, and payments on long-term debt.
see "note 22. parent company financial information" for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions.
access to funding at the parent company is more sensitive to market disruptions. therefore, truist prudently manages cash levels at the parent company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. in determining the buffer, truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to truist bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, the parent company had 43 months and 29 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 22 months and 20 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends.
truist bank truist carefully manages liquidity risk at truist bank. truist bank's primary source of funding is client deposits. continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested.
truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional cds, overnight and term federal funds markets, and retail brokered cds. truist bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including fhlb advances, repurchase agreements, and the frb discount window. at december 31, 2020, truist bank had approximately $198.7 billion of available secured borrowing capacity, which represents approximately 9.4 times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in one-year or less. in addition to secured borrowing sources, truist had excess eligible cash at the federal reserve bank of $13.4 billion at december 31, 2020.
74 truist financial corporation the ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies' views of the parent company's and truist bank's credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. management meets with the rating agencies on a regular basis to discuss current outlooks. in april 2020, dbrs revised its outlook for truist and truist bank from "positive" to "stable," citing economic deterioration related to covid-19. dbrs affirmed all other ratings for truist and truist bank. additionally, fitch revised its outlook for truist and truist bank from "stable" to "negative," also citing pandemic-related economic deterioration. fitch downgraded truist's subordinated debt to a-, and upgraded truist's preferred stock to bbb, in order to align these ratings to its recently revised bank rating methodology.
in july 2020, fitch completed the implementation of its revised bank rating methodology. as a result, fitch downgraded truist's senior unsecured debt to a and affirmed truist bank's senior unsecured and subordinated debt ratings. this rating action taken by fitch was solely a function of implementing its revised bank rating methodology and did not reflect a change in fitch's current or expected view of truist's or truist bank's credit fundamentals.

76 truist financial corporation capital the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. truist's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support truist's risk profile consistent with the board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for truist and its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders. risk-based capital ratios, which include cet1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.
truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the company's capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. management regularly monitors the capital position of truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. in this regard, management's overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets, which are above the regulatory "well capitalized" minimums. management has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum targets to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the frb for the annual ccar process. breaches of stressed minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in truist's capital plan.

(1)the truist targets are subject to revision based on finalization of pending regulatory guidance and other strategic factors.
(2)truist's goal is to maintain capital levels above all regulatory minimums.
(3)reflects a scb of 270 basis points for truist.
during the first quarter of 2020, as market conditions evolved, truist received board approval to establish new interim operating targets that provide for sufficient capital levels while allowing the company to support clients through the economic downturn. these interim operating targets will be evaluated as economic conditions evolve.
while nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the company temporarily falling below its operating targets for one or more of these ratios, it is management's intent to return to these operating targets within a reasonable period of time through capital planning. such temporary decreases below the operating minimums shown above are not considered an infringement of truist's overall capital policy, provided a return above the minimums is forecasted to occur within a reasonable time period.
in august 2020, the federal reserve informed truist of its scb of 270 basis points for risk-based capital ratios. this buffer was determined based on stress testing results developed by the federal reserve and is effective from october 1, 2020 through september 30, 2021, at which point a revised scb will be calculated and provided to truist. consistent with the federal reserve's mandate across the industry, truist resubmitted its capital plan in november 2020 to reflect changes in financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook. truist's review of the results of the 2020 ccar supervisory stress test notes that the modeled outcomes shown by the frb differ from those calculated by the company. truist believes those differences are attributable in part to the application of purchase accounting associated with the merger. purchase accounting adjustments could result in a reduction in provision expense and an increase in pre-provision net revenue. these differences could result in higher capital ratios than were reflected in the ccar results.
in december 2020, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of the company's common stock beginning in the first quarter of 2021, as well as certain other actions to optimize truist's capital position. management's intention is to maintain an approximate 10% common equity tier 1 ratio after considering strategic actions such as non-bank acquisitions or stock repurchases, as well as changes in risk-weighted assets. any stock repurchase activity will be informed by economic and regulatory considerations as well as truist's capital position, earnings outlook, and capital deployment priorities.
payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. in addition, management closely monitors the parent company's double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders' equity). the active management of the subsidiaries' equity capital, as described above, is the process used to manage this important driver of parent company liquidity and is a key element in the management of truist's capital position.

management intends to maintain capital at truist bank at levels that will result in classification as "well-capitalized" for regulatory purposes. secondarily, it is management's intent to maintain truist bank's capital at levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size, complexity and risk profile. if the capital levels of truist bank increase above these guidelines, excess capital may be transferred to the parent company in the form of special dividend payments, subject to regulatory and other operating considerations.
management's capital deployment plan in order of preference is to focus on (i) organic growth, (ii) dividends, and (iii) strategic opportunities and/or share repurchases depending on opportunities in the marketplace and truist's interest and ability to proceed with acquisitions.

(1)the leverage ratio is calculated using end of period tier 1 capital and quarterly average tangible assets. the timing of the merger impacted the 4q19 result.
(2)truist became subject to the supplementary leverage ratio as of january 1, 2020.
(3)tangible common equity and related measures are non-gaap measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. these measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. truist's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk. these capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies.
capital ratios improved compared to year-end 2020, due to growth in cet1 capital, partially offset by higher risk-weighted assets. truist's capital levels remain strong compared to the regulatory levels for well capitalized banks at december 31, 2020. truist's other capital measures also improved as truist issued various capital instruments to strengthen its capital position. truist issued $3.5 billion of preferred stock and redeemed $500 million of series k preferred stock during 2020. in addition, truist issued $1.3 billion of subordinated debt. during 2020,truist paid $2.4 billion in common stock dividends or $1.80 per share, which resulted in a total payout ratio of 58.0% for the year.

fourth quarter 2020 results compared to fourth quarter 2019
total taxable-equivalent revenues were $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting an increase of $1.1 billion in taxable-equivalent net interest income and an increase of $887 million in noninterest income.
net interest margin was 3.08%, down 33 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. average earning assets increased $175.6 billion. the increase in average earning assets reflects a $114.5 billion increase in average total loans and leases and a $41.4 billion increase in average securities. average other earning assets increased $17.5 billion primarily due to higher interest-earning balances at the federal reserve. average interest-bearing liabilities increased $107.3 billion compared to the earlier quarter. average interest-bearing deposits increased $101.9 billion, average long-term debt increased $10.4 billion and average short-term borrowings decreased $5.0 billion. the significant increases in earning assets and liabilities are primarily due to the merger, as well as impacts from the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting government stimulus programs.
the yield on the total loan portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 4.12%, down 79 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting the impact of rate decreases, partially offset by purchase accounting accretion from merged loans. the yield on the average securities portfolio was 1.60%, down 105 basis points compared to the earlier quarter primarily due to lower yields on new purchases.
the average cost of total deposits was 0.07%, down 50 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.11%, down 71 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. the average rate on short-term borrowings was 0.77%, down 138 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. the average rate on long-term debt was 1.64%, down 128 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. the lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower rate environment. the lower rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt and the issuance of new long-term debt.
the provision for credit losses was $177 million, compared to $171 million for the earlier quarter. net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $205 million compared to $192 million in the earlier quarter. the net charge-off rate for the current quarter of 0.27% was down 13 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.

noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased $887 million compared to the earlier quarter. the earlier quarter included a loss of $116 million from the sale of securities. excluding the securities losses, noninterest income increased $771 million, with nearly all categories of noninterest income being impacted by the merger. insurance income increased $36 million due to strong production and premium growth, as well as acquisitions. investment banking and trading income, commercial real estate related income, wealth management income and residential mortgage banking income all had improved performance compared to the combined levels from the earlier quarter. service charges on deposits continued to rebound, but remained below 2019 combined levels due to reduced overdraft incident rates.
noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was up $1.3 billion compared to the earlier quarter. merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the merger increased $85 million and $78 million, respectively. excluding the merger-related items mentioned above and the impact of an increase of $101 million of amortization expense for intangibles, adjusted noninterest expense was up $994 million primarily reflecting the impact of the merger.
the provision for income taxes was $311 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $153 million for the earlier quarter. this produced an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 of 19.0%, compared to 17.4% for the earlier quarter. the higher effective tax rate is primarily due to higher pre-tax income.

critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of truist are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. the financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. understanding truist's accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. accordingly, truist's significant accounting policies and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in "note 1. basis of presentation."
the following is a summary of truist's critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments. these critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a periodic basis.
acl truist's policy is to maintain an acl, which represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and management's judgement. the models are designed to forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. the models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years. beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to long-term historical loss conditions over a one year period. expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity, giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a tdr.
a qualitative allowance which incorporates management's judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses, including qualitative adjustments in circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with management's expectations with respect to expected credit losses. this allowance is used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to the current economic conditions and capture risks in the portfolio such as considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events, the outcomes of which are uncertain. these events may include, but are not limited to, political conditions, legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which truist conducts business.
loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and significant loans that are considered collateral-dependent are individually evaluated. for these loans, the alll is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral, if any. for tdrs, default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the alll.
80 truist financial corporation the methodology used to determine an estimate for the rufc is similar to that used to determine the funded component of the alll and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable. the rufc is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the acl is included in "note 1. basis of presentation."
fair value of financial instruments the vast majority of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. refer to "note 18. fair value disclosures" for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments and "note 2. business combinations" for additional disclosures regarding business combinations.
securities truist generally utilizes a third-party pricing service in determining the fair value of its afs investment securities, whereas trading securities are priced internally. fair value measurements for investment securities are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads and broker quotes. management performs procedures to evaluate the fair values provided by the third-party service provider. these procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible bu, include comparison of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third-party pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the third-party pricing service and other third-party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third-party pricing service. the enterprise valuation committee, which provides oversight to truist's enterprise-wide ipv function, is responsible for the comparison of pricing information received from the third-party pricing service or internally to other third-party pricing sources, approving tolerance limits determined by ipv for price comparison exceptions, reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities. when market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity or inactive markets for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management to reflect unobservable input assumptions.
msrs truist's primary class of msrs for which it separately manages the economic risks relates to residential mortgages. residential msrs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. while sales of msrs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. accordingly, truist estimates the fair value of residential msrs using a stochastic oas valuation model to project residential msr cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. the oas model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually-specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. truist reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the residential msr asset.
fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, observable market data. due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential msrs are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. the value of residential msrs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. in general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of msrs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity. conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of residential msrs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. truist typically hedges against market value changes in the residential msrs. refer to "note 8. loan servicing" for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of residential msrs.
lhfs truist originates certain residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale to investors that are measured at fair value. the fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. changes in the fair value are recorded as components of residential mortgage income and commercial real estate related income, while the related origination costs are generally recognized in personnel expense when incurred. the changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the lhfs. truist uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans. lhfs also includes certain loans, generally carried at locom, where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale. adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value, up to the original carrying amount, and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale are classified as noninterest income. the fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available, although may also incorporate other unobservable inputs such as indicative bids or broker price opinions. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for further description of the company's accounting for lhfs.

trading loans truist elects to measure certain loans at fair value for financial reporting where fair value aligns with the underlying business purpose. specifically, loans included within this classification include trading loans that are (i) purchased in connection with the company's trs business, (ii) part of the loan sales and trading business within the c&cb segment, or (iii) backed by the sba. refer to "note 16. commitments and contingencies," and "note 19. derivative financial instruments," for further discussion of the company's trs business. the loans purchased in connection with the company's trs and sales and trading businesses are primarily commercial and corporate leveraged loans valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third party pricing service. sba loans are fully guaranteed by the u.s. government as to contractual principal and interest and there is sufficient observable trading activity upon which to base the estimate of fair value.
derivative assets and liabilities truist uses derivatives to manage various financial risks and in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions. truist mitigates credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. in addition, certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to truist when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable data for interest rates, foreign exchange, equity and credit. the fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that truist does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee. refer to "note 19. derivative financial instruments" for further information on the company's derivatives.
purchased loans the fair value for purchased loans in a business combination is based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considers credit loss expectations, market interest rates and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. loans are grouped together according to similar characteristics and are treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. the probability of default, loss given default and prepayment assumptions are key factors driving credit losses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows. these assumptions are informed by internal data on loan characteristics, historical loss experience, and current and forecasted economic conditions. the interest and liquidity component of the estimate is determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of each loan. the discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity. the discount rate does not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows.
intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values. this often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, which are inherently subjective. the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. business combinations also typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for a description of the impairment testing process.
at december 31, 2020, truist's reporting units with goodwill balances were cb&w, c&cb and ih. management reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. for its annual impairment review, truist elected to perform a quantitative test of each of its reporting units. the quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach and the market approach, weighted 60% and 40%, respectively. the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis. the market approach utilizes comparable public company information, key valuation multiples and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit.
the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, and applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information. truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time, including consideration of historic bank control premiums and the current market.
82 truist financial corporation multi-year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin, expected credit losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense and required capital. of these inputs, the projection of net interest margin is the most significant to the financial projections of the cb&w and c&cb reporting units. the long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was 2.5% as of october 1, 2020, based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit. discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. the discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. the discount rates utilized for the cb&w, c&cb and ih reporting units as of october 1, 2020 were 11%, 10%, and 9%, respectively.
based on the company's annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of october 1, it was determined for the cb&w, c&cb and ih reporting units that the respective reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its respective carrying value as of october 1, 2020; however, for the c&cb reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%, indicating that the goodwill of this reporting unit may be at risk of impairment. circumstances that could negatively impact the fair value for the c&cb reporting unit in the future include an increase in the applicable discount rate, an increase in required capital, or deterioration in the c&cb reporting unit's forecasts.
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions; therefore, in some instances, changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. the company performs sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions, and the resulting estimated fair values. the analysis of the c&cb reporting unit at october 1, 2020, indicated that if the discount rate was increased 100 basis points, the reporting unit's fair value would be less than its carrying value, resulting in goodwill impairment. ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. additionally, a reporting unit's carrying value could change based on market conditions, asset growth, or the risk profile of those reporting units, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value.
the company monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of 2020, including the continuing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, concluding that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of december 31, 2020.
income taxes truist is subject to income tax laws of the u.s., its states, and the municipalities in which the company conducts business. in estimating the net amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future, the company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the company's tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws and new judicial guidance, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. these changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect operating results. truist reviews tax positions quarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new information becomes available.
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from nol and tax credit carryforwards. the company regularly evaluates the realizability of dtas, recognizing a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the dta will not be realized. in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, the company considers the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. truist currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards and certain other state dtas. for additional income tax information, refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" and "note 14. income taxes."
pension and postretirement benefit obligations truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to teammates. calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions, which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. the discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to a high-quality corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations. in 2020, in connection with the merger of the bb&t and suntrust pension plans truist refined the corporate bond yield curve used in determining the discount rate and moved to a aa above median yield curve from the previously used aa rated bond yield curve. the impact of this change was an increase of approximately 11 basis points in the discount rate as of december 31, 2020.
truist financial corporation 83
management also considered the sensitivity that changes in the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense. for the company's qualified plans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately $27 million for 2021, while a decrease of 100 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately $149 million in pension expense for 2021. refer to "note 15. benefit plans" for disclosures related to the benefit plans.

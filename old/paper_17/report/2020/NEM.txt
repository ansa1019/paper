item 1a.       risk factors (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)
our business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. you should carefully consider these risks. if any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. see "forward-looking statements."
risks related to our operations and business our operations and business have been affected by the covid-19 pandemic, and may be materially and adversely impacted in the future.
the company faces risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which could significantly disrupt operations and may materially and adversely affect its business and financial conditions. in march 2020, the world health organization declared covid-19 a pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has had an ongoing material impact on the global economy, the duration of which remains uncertain. the covid-19 pandemic has also disrupted global supply chains and workforce participation, including our own, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.
while the medical community is progressing development of vaccines and other treatment options and governmental agencies, private agencies and the company seek to mitigate the spread of covid-19, the efficacy and timing of such measures remains uncertain. efforts to slow the spread of covid-19 have already impacted the operation of newmont's mines and the development of projects and led to the temporary cancellation of certain exploration activities. for companies, such as newmont, that operate in multiple jurisdictions, disadvantage and risk of loss due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain diseases and potential endemic health issues may occur. a number of governments declared states of emergency and implemented restrictive measures such as travel bans, quarantine and self-isolation. whether additional isolation or restrictions on non-essential business will be put in place again in the future (such as a stay-in, shelter-in place or similar orders) as a covid-19 mitigation initiative, whether mining will be considered an essential business (and therefore exempt and able to maintain its business operations as adjusted for covid-19 risks) and the duration of any such orders will remain outside of the company's control and are subject to the regulations issued by the respective governments.
the company carefully considers government restrictions and the needs of its employees and host communities. for example, in order to protect nearby communities and align with government travel restrictions or health considerations in argentina, canada, peru and mexico, five of newmont's operations were temporarily put into care and maintenance during march and april 2020. although all such sites safely recommenced activities, if there is an increase in incidents of covid-19 in those countries or regions or other table of contents jurisdictions in which the company operates, there may be further restrictions put in place by the governments or the company which could result in an adverse impact to operations and productivity at those sites.
additionally, the company incurred, and will continue to incur costs as a result of actions taken to protect against the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic and to comply with local mandates, including but not limited to contributions to the newmont global community support fund, additional health screenings, incremental travel, security and employee related costs.
based upon evolving contagion rates or occurrences at our operating sites, senior management or the board may decide to reduce operational activities and limit activities to essential care and maintenance procedures including the management of critical environmental systems. such reductions in our operational activities could have a material adverse impact on our business, or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the impact of this pandemic could include additional sites being placed into care and maintenance. if the majority of our sites are placed into care and maintenance, this could significantly reduce our cash flow and impact our ability to meet certain covenants related to our revolving credit facility and borrowing capacity.
other impacts of changing government restriction could include prolonged travel restraints, more stringent shipment restraints, delays in product refining and smelting due to restrictions or temporary closures, other supply chain disruptions and workforce interruptions, including loss of life, and reputational damage in connection with challenges or reactions to action or perceived inaction by the company related to the covid-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial position.
the full extent to which covid-19 impacts the company will depend on future developments, including the roll out and effectiveness of the covid-19 vaccines, which remain uncertain.
a substantial or extended decline in gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices would have a material adverse effect on us.
our business is dependent on the prices of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. factors tending to influence prices include:
•gold sales, purchases or leasing by governments and central banks;
•speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or other metals;
•the relative strength of the u.s. dollar;
•the monetary policies employed by the world's major central banks;
•the fiscal policies employed by the world's major industrialized economies;
•expectations of the future rate of inflation;
•interest rates;
•recession or reduced economic activity in the united states, china, india and other industrialized or developing countries;
•decreased industrial, jewelry, base metal or investment demand;
•increased import and export taxes;
•increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;
•forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions;
•availability of cheaper substitute materials; and
•changing investor or consumer sentiment, including in connection with transition to a low-carbon economy, investor interest in crypto currencies and other investment alternatives and other factors.
average gold prices for 2020 were $1,770 per ounce (2019: $1,393; 2018: $1,268), average copper prices for 2020 were $2.80 per pound (2019: $2.72; 2018: $2.96), average silver prices for 2020 were $20.55 per ounce (2019: $16.21), average lead prices for 2020 were $0.83 per pound (2019: $0.91) and average zinc prices for 2020 were $1.03 per pound (2019: $1.16). any decline in our realized prices adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to sales of gold, silver, copper, lead or zinc. we have recorded asset impairments in the past and may experience additional impairments as a result of lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices in the future.
in addition, sustained lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices can:
•reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that have become uneconomic at sustained lower metal prices;

•reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads and increase the likelihood and amount that the company might be required to record as an impairment charge related to the carrying value of its stockpiles and ore on leach pads;
•halt or delay the development of new projects;
•reduce funds available for exploration and advanced projects with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and
•reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices we may be unable to replace gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead reserves as they become depleted.
producers of gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and other metals must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.
we may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves from others related to development properties and operating mines. such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for future gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and projections of how these may change in the future. in addition, in connection with any acquisitions we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties (including ability to permit and compliance with existing regulations) and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate ore reserves. in addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.
as a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.
estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.
the reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc that we estimated, at december 31, 2020, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. such estimates are, or will be, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. if our reserve estimations are required to be revised using significantly lower gold, silver, zinc, copper and lead prices as a result of a decrease in commodity prices, increases in operating costs, reductions in metallurgical recovery or other modifying factors, this could result in material write-downs of our investment in mining properties, goodwill and increased amortization, reclamation and closure charges.
producers use feasibility studies for undeveloped ore bodies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. actual operating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change.
additionally, the term "mineralized material" does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the sec or the company's standards. estimates of mineralized material are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. the company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the mineralized material deposit will ever be confirmed or converted into sec industry guide 7 compliant reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.
in 2018, the sec adopted amendments to the disclosure requirements for mining registrants. under these new rules, sec industry guide 7 will be rescinded and replaced with the disclosure standards under new regulation s-k subpart 1300. sec industry guide 7 remains in effect, subject to a transition period. newmont will be required to comply with the new rules for fiscal years 2021 and after. accordingly, future adjustment to estimates of reserves or mineralized material will occur due to the differing standards under the new requirements including, but not limited to, the replacement of our estimate of mineralized material with an estimate of table of contents
"mineral resources." in addition, certain provisions of the new disclosure standards are more restrictive and/or prescriptive than those used in other regulatory jurisdictions resulting in variation on declarations and disclosures from those of our non-us joint-venture partners and competitors.
in addition, if the price of gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead declines from recent levels, if production costs increase, grades decline, recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, the indicated level of recovery may not be realized or mineral reserves or mineralized material might not be mined or processed profitably. if we determine that certain of our ore reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves and mineralized material. consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and mineralized material are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired.
estimates relating to projects and mine plans of existing operations are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated.
mine development and expansion projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up. our decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. the actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others:
•changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;
•changes in input commodity and labor costs;
•the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;
•adverse geotechnical conditions;
•availability of adequate and skilled labor force;
•availability, supply and cost of water and power;
•fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;
•availability and terms of financing;
•delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development;
•changes in tax laws, the laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes due to the regional and national governments and royalty agreements;
•weather or severe climate impacts, including, without limitation, prolonged or unexpected precipitation, drought and/or sub-zero temperatures;
•potential delays and restrictions in connection with health and safety issues, including pandemics (such as covid-19) and other infectious diseases;
•potential delays relating to social and community issues, including, without limitation, issues resulting in protests, road blockages or work stoppages; and
•potential challenges to mining activities or to permits or other approvals or delays in development and construction of projects based on claims of disturbance of cultural resources or the inability to secure consent for such disturbance.
new projects require, among other things, the successful completion of feasibility studies, attention to various fiscal, tax and royalty matters, obtainment of, and compliance with, required governmental permits and arrangements for necessary surface and other land rights. we may also have to identify adequate sources of water and power for new projects, ensure that appropriate community infrastructure (for example, reliable rail, ports, roads, and bridges) is developed to support the project and secure appropriate financing to fund a new project. these infrastructures and services are often provided by third parties whose operational activities are outside of our control. establishing infrastructure for our development projects requires significant resources, identification of adequate sources of raw materials and supplies, and the cooperation of national and regional governments, none of which can be assured. in addition, new projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future financial and operating performance, including future cash flow. thus, it is possible that actual costs may increase significantly and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates. consequently, our future development activities may not result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
for our existing operations, we base our mine plans on geological and metallurgical assumptions, financial projections and commodity price estimates. these estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material, revisions to environmental obligations, changes in legislation and/or our table of contents political or economic environment, and other significant events associated with mining operations. further, future positive revisions, if any, remain subject to improvements in costs, recovery, commodity price or a combination of these and other factors. additionally, we review our operations for events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. if indicators of impairment are determined to exist at our mine operations, we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. we also review our goodwill for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. management makes multiple assumptions in estimating future undiscounted cash flows, which include productions levels based on life of mine plans, future costs of production, estimates of future production levels based on value beyond proven and probable reserves at the operations, prices of metals, the historical experience of the operations and other factors. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating production levels of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead and the costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges. we may be required to recognize material non-cash charges relating to impairments of long-lived assets and/or goodwill in the future if actual results differ materially from management's estimates, which include metal prices, our ability to reduce or control production or capital costs through strategic mine optimization initiatives, increased costs or decreased production due to regulatory issues or if we do not realize the mineable ore reserves or exploration potential at our mining properties. if an impairment charge is incurred, such charges are not reversible at a later date even when favorable modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material, favorable revisions to environmental obligations, favorable changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other favorable events occur. as a result of these uncertainties, actual results may be less favorable than estimated returns and initial financial outlook.
increased operating and capital costs could affect our profitability.
costs at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing related facilities and equipment. in addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel, concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. a material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.
we could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond our control. increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects.
mine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.
natural resource extractive companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead mining operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and mine closure plans that may change materially. for example, we have conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive sites in the united states. in addition, we are conducting remediation activities at a third site in the united states, an inactive uranium mine and associated mill site formerly operated by one of our subsidiaries and reclamation of several closed mine sites acquired with the goldcorp transaction in guatemala and california. in addition, we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future.
the laws and regulations governing mine closure and reclamation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. for a more detailed description of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in environmental matters in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements. in addition, regulators are increasingly requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of environmental obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act of 1980 ("cercla") and its state law equivalents, current or former owners of properties may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of site cleanup or required to undertake remedial actions in response to unpermitted releases of hazardous substances at such property, in addition to, among other potential consequences, liability to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be significant. these subject properties are referred to as "superfund" sites. for example, the inactive midnite uranium mine is a superfund site subject to cercla. it is possible that certain of our other current or former operations in the u.s. could be designated as a superfund site in the future, exposing us to potential liability under cercla.
table of contents any underestimated or unanticipated retirement and rehabilitation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to newmont stockholders and potentially result in impairments.
damage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.
damage to our reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of a variety of events and circumstances, and could result in negative publicity (for example, with respect to handling of environmental, safety and security matters, dealings with local community organizations or individuals, community commitments, handling of cultural sites or resources, and various other matters).
recently we have received increased demands from stakeholders for greater transparency on environmental, social and governance performance at the site level. we developed a responsible sourcing strategy to attempt to respond and provided supplemental disclosures in our beyond the mine annual sustainability report. our code of conduct (the "code") forms the foundation of our internal governance structure as well as our commitment to responsible mining. we encourage employees and others to promptly report incidents of possible violations of the code and/or our global policies and standards, including in the areas of business integrity, social and environmental, community relations and human rights. employees and non-employees, including suppliers and community members, can anonymously report concerns via our third-party helpline. each mine site has a complaints and grievances register to record matters raised by local stakeholders. when necessary, we use independent mechanisms agreed to by the complainants, such as a local leader or committee, to facilitate resolution of such matters before they require public or legal intervention. for disclosure on the nature of the cases and community complaints and grievances arising from the grievance mechanism or helpline, please refer to our beyond the mine annual sustainability report available on our website. however, we are not always able to resolve these matters before they are raised publicly or in legal or regulatory proceedings and in the future we may not be able to meet the growing demands of stakeholders through these mechanisms. such matters once publicized may negatively impact our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
the growing use of social media to generate, publish and discuss community news and issues and to connect with others has made it significantly easier, among other things, for individuals and groups to share their opinions of us and our activities, whether true or not. we do not have direct control over how we are perceived by others and any resulting loss of reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
we are dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation, upgrade, operation and integration.
we are dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems in the conduct of our operations. our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, may be targeted by increasingly sophisticated threat actors. these threats include continually evolving cybersecurity risks from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, malware, computer viruses, cyber threats, extortion, employee error, malfeasance, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. cybersecurity risk is increasingly difficult to identify and quantify and cannot be fully mitigated because of the rapidly evolving nature of the threats, targets and consequences. additionally, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our third-party service providers, employees or vendors. we have experienced attempts by external parties to compromise our networks and systems. although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for preparing and protecting against such attempts and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient against future attacks. any future material compromise or breach of our it systems could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions. outages in our operational technology may affect operations related to health and safety and could result in putting lives at risk of harm or death. in addition, as technologies evolve and these cybersecurity attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. for instance, we review our cybersecurity controls against current industry threats and partner with security vendors to assist with protecting our network and data resources through activities such as penetration and vulnerability testing, assessments against current cybersecurity standards, and leveraging industry recommendations from both independent vendors as well as industry partners. these efforts are designed to address any remediation actions through our ongoing cyber security program. such efforts may incur significant costs and yet prove insufficient to deter future cybersecurity attacks or prevent all security breaches.
table of contents we could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
to the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or enter into any joint ventures, our interest in these properties is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of joint ventures.
to the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or enter into any joint ventures in the future, the existence or occurrence of one or more of the following circumstances and events could have a material adverse impact on our profitability or the viability of our interests held through joint ventures, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition:
•inconsistent economic, political or business interests or goals between partners or disagreements with partners on strategy for the most efficient development or operation of mines;
•inability to control certain strategic decisions made in respect of properties;
•exercise of majority rights by our partners so as to take actions for which we may not believe to be in the joint venture's best interests, including but not limited to decisions related to labor relations, litigation, government relations, political contributions, community relations, project approval and project funding mechanisms;
•inability of partners to meet their financial and other obligations to the joint venture or third parties; and
•litigation between partners regarding management, funding or other decisions related to the joint venture.
to the extent that we are not the operator of a joint venture properties, such that we will be unable to control the activities of the operator, the success of such operations will be beyond our control. in many cases we will be bound by the decisions made by the operator in the operation of such property, and will rely on the operator to manage the property and to provide accurate information related to such property. we can provide no assurance that all decisions of operators of properties we do not control will achieve the expected results.
for example, our joint ventures, including the joint venture that combines our and barrick gold corporation's ("barrick") respective nevada operations, forming ngm, pursuant to the operating agreement entered into on july 1, 2019 between barrick, newmont and their wholly-owned subsidiaries party thereto (the "nevada jv agreement"), may not be as beneficial to us as expected, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, integration challenges, political risks, labor disputes or other factors. pursuant to the terms of the nevada jv agreement, we hold a 38.5 percent economic interest and barrick holds a 61.5 percent economic interest in ngm. barrick operates ngm with overall management responsibility and is subject to the supervision and direction of ngm's board of managers, which is comprised of three managers appointed by barrick and two managers appointed by newmont. outside of certain prescribed matters, decisions of the board of managers will be determined by majority vote, with the managers appointed by each company having voting power in proportion to such company's economic interests in ngm.
because we beneficially own less than a majority of the ownership interests in ngm, we have limited control of ngm's operations and we depend in part on barrick to operate ngm. in the event that barrick has interests, objectives and incentives with respect to ngm that differ from our own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve such disagreement in our favor. any such disagreement could have a material adverse effect on our interest in ngm, the business of ngm or the portion of our growth strategy related to ngm. additionally, to the extent ngm is subject to liabilities or litigation, we could be required to become responsible for a proportional share of certain liabilities and/or ngm's operations could be impacted, which could have an adverse impact on the company's cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial position. for example, bullion monarch mining inc. ("bullion monarch") has alleged the existence of a 1% net smelter royalty on production over an area of interest encompassing the northern carlin trend and covering much of the carlin complex. bullion monarch has filed suits in u.s. federal and state courts seeking to enforce the alleged royalty with respect to historical and future production from the carlin complex. although ngm and barrick dispute the existence of the alleged royalty and defending these claims, an adverse outcome could negatively impact ngm's profitability.
additionally, the company is subject to certain funding requirements in connection with its joint ventures. in 2020, the company and barrick entered into an agreement with pueblo viejo to provide additional funding of up to $1,300 ($520 attributable to newmont's 40% ownership interest) through a loan facility for the expansion of pueblo viejo's operations. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
table of contents financial risks increased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and capital controls may adversely affect newmont's costs, earnings and the value of some of our assets.
our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar and the majority of our earnings and cash flows are denominated in u.s. dollars. we conduct certain business in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. a portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. the appreciation of those local currencies against the u.s. dollar increases our costs of production in u.s. dollar terms at mines located outside the united states. the foreign currencies that primarily affect our results of operations are the australian dollar and the canadian dollar. our consolidated earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by movements in the exchange rates. change in the value of the currencies of the australian dollar, canadian dollar, the mexican peso, the argentine peso, the ghana cedi, the chilean peso or surinamese dollar versus the u.s. dollar could negatively impact our earnings.
in addition, from time to time, countries in which we operate adopt measures to restrict the availability of the local currency or the repatriation of capital across borders. these measures are imposed by governments or central banks, in some cases during times of economic instability, to prevent the removal of capital or the sudden devaluation of local currencies or to maintain in-country foreign currency reserves. in addition, many emerging markets countries require consents or reporting processes before local currency earnings can be converted into u.s. dollars or other currencies and/or such earnings can be repatriated or otherwise transferred outside of the operating jurisdiction. these measures may have a number of negative effects on newmont, reducing the immediately available capital that we could otherwise deploy for investment opportunities or the payment of expenses. in addition, measures that restrict the availability of the local currency or impose a requirement to operate in the local currency may create other practical difficulties for newmont. for example, in september 2019, argentina imposed foreign currency controls. see also "our merian operation in suriname is subject to political and economic risks" for information regarding the devaluation of the surinamese dollar. for more information on argentina's temporary foreign currency controls, see results of consolidated operations and foreign currency exchange rates sections in item 7, management's discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
for information concerning the sensitivity of our costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and more information our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, see foreign currency exchange rates section in item 7, management's discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
inflation may have a material adverse effect on results of operations.
certain of our operations are located in countries that have in the past experienced high rates of inflation. it is possible that in the future, high inflation in the countries in which we operate may result in an increase in operational costs in local currencies (without a concurrent devaluation of the local currency of operations against the dollar or an increase in the dollar price of gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead). for instance, in argentina, the level of inflation during 2019 reached 53.8%, the highest since 1991. maintaining operating costs in argentine pesos could expose us to risks relating to peso devaluation and high domestic inflation. this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. suriname has also historically experienced high levels of inflation, which may recur in the future. significantly higher and sustained rates of inflation, with subsequent increases in operational costs, could result in the deferral or closure of projects and mines in the event that operating costs become prohibitive.
future funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pay cash dividends or our ability to engage in share repurchase transactions.
potential future investments, including projects in the company's project pipeline, acquisitions and other investments, will require significant funds for capital expenditures. depending on gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead prices, our operating cash flow may not be sufficient to meet all of these expenditures, depending on the timing of development of these and other projects. as a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities, fund construction and operation of potential future projects and various exploration projects, fund share repurchase transactions and pay dividends. our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. we may determine that it may be necessary or preferable to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. however, u.s. and global markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions, and the covid-19 pandemic has increased, and may continue to increase, volatility and pricing in the capital markets. additional financing may not be commercially available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, any additional financing may involve substantial dilution to existing shareholders. in the event of lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt, repurchase shares and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. if we are unable to obtain financing or service existing or future debt we could be required to reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments to stockholders or any planned share repurchase transactions. in addition, our joint venture partners may not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability in order to make their capital commitments. in the case that our partners do not make their economic commitments, the company may be prevented table of contents from pursuing certain development opportunities or may assume additional financial obligations, which may require new sources of capital.
our goodwill could become impaired, which could have a material non-cash adverse effect on our results of operations.
we recorded substantial goodwill, primarily as the result of our acquisition of goldcorp in 2019. we accounted for the acquisition of goldcorp using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets and liabilities of the acquired business be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill. our balance sheet reflects additions to the carrying amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the goldcorp acquisition. we review our goodwill for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. to the extent the value of goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment. for additional information regarding goodwill, see note 24 to our consolidated financial statements.
our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.
we recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. to the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. in the future, our estimates could change requiring a valuation allowance or impairment of our deferred tax assets. additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under the heading "income and mining taxes - valuation of deferred tax assets" and note 2 under the heading "summary of significant accounting policies - valuation of deferred tax assets" for additional information and factors that could impact the company's ability to realize the deferred tax assets. for additional information regarding newmont's non-current deferred tax assets, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing.
there can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by standard & poor's rating services or moody's investors service to newmont will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. if we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. the company's credit ratings have been subject to change over the years. we currently maintain a standard & poor's rating of "bbb" (positive outlook) and a moody's investors service rating of baa1 (stable). we cannot make assurances regarding how long these ratings will remain unchanged or regarding the outcome of the rating agencies future reviews (including following any planned or future business combinations). a downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of operations and financial position.
returns for investments in pension plans are uncertain.
we maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide for specified payments after retirement. the company's qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with irs rules and regulations. the company's non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements under the heading "pension and other benefit plans" for additional information regarding the funding status of qualified and non-qualified plans. as of december 31, 2020, all pension benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of assets. the company reviews its retirement benefit programs on a regular basis and will consider market conditions and the funded status of its qualified pension plans in determining whether additional contributions are appropriate. the ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. a sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. if future plan investment returns are not sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future cash contributions.
the occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability.
we maintain insurance policies that may respond to certain risks related to our operations. this insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk. however, we may elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring certain risks related to the mining industry or for various other reasons. in other cases, insurance may not be available for certain risks. we operate in certain jurisdictions that remain subject to additional risks. see "risks related to the jurisdictions in which we operate." some concern exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic crises table of contents are possible. these countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. we do not maintain insurance policies against political risk. occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our results of operations and financial position.
risks related to our industry we may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining.
the exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty. these can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. these factors include, but are not limited to:
•environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals;
•industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining equipment, milling equipment and/or conveyor systems and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations, milling and processing;
•accidents in connection with transportation, including transportation of chemicals, explosions or other materials, transportation of large mining equipment and transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites;
•social, community or labor force disputes or stoppages, such as at peñasquito and cerro negro;
•changes to legal and regulatory requirements;
•security incidents, including activities of illegal or artisanal miners, gold bullion or concentrate theft, including in transport, and corruption and fraud;
•shortages in materials or equipment and energy and electrical power supply interruptions or rationing;
•failure of unproven or evolving technologies or loss of information integrity or data;
•unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);
•metallurgical conditions and gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc and other metal recovery, including unexpected decline of ore grade;
•unanticipated changes in inventory levels at heap-leach operations;
•ground and water conditions;
•fall-of-ground accidents in underground operations;
•failure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls;
•seismic activity;
•surface or underground fires or floods; and
•other natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions, including those impacting operations or the ability to access and supply sites.
the occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development and production of mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.
we compete with other natural resource companies, and shortage of critical parts and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects.
we compete with other natural resource companies for specialized equipment and supplies necessary for exploration and development, as well as for rights to mine properties containing gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and other minerals. the mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, trucks, shovels and tires. these shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and construction schedules. we may be unable to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations.
we may be unable to obtain or retain necessary permits, which could adversely affect our operations.
our mining and processing operations and development and exploration activities are subject to extensive permitting requirements. the requirements to obtain and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits can be costly and involve table of contents extended timelines. while we strive to obtain and comply with all permits required of us, there can be no assurance that we will obtain all such permits and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits at all times. previously obtained permits may be suspended or revoked for a number of reasons, including through government or court action. failure to obtain and/or comply with required permits can have serious consequences, including damage to our reputation; cessation of the development of a project; increased costs of development or production and litigation or regulatory action, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our ability to obtain the required permits and approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to successfully operate near communities in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends in part on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to operate near certain communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, health and safety of communities in which we operate. key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be adjusted in a manner that adversely affects our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations.
mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate in order to maintain operations.
greater scrutiny on the private sector broadly and multi-national companies specifically, to contribute to sustainable outcomes in the places where they operate, has led to a proliferation of standards and reporting initiatives focused on environmental stewardship, social performance and transparency. extractive industries, and mining in particular, have seen significant increases in stakeholder expectations. these businesses are increasingly required to meaningfully engage with impacted stakeholders; understand and avoid or mitigate negative impacts while optimizing economic development and employment opportunities associated with their operations. the expectation is for companies to create shared value for shareholders, employees, governments, local communities and host countries. such expectations tend to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are perceived to have high socio-economic and environmental impacts. in response, newmont has over many years developed and continues to evolve a robust system of esg management that includes standards, guidance, assurance, participation in international organizations focused on improved performance and outcomes for host communities and the environment. in ghana, for instance, in response to resettlement-related complaints, newmont worked with national and local government authorities, traditional leaders, impacted farmers/landowners and other concerned stakeholders to analyze impacts, extend programs to support vulnerable households and provide enhanced livelihood support. as the covid-19 pandemic unfolded in early 2020, first nation communities expressed concerns to newmont about community exposures from operating mine sites. in response, newmont put two mines into care and maintenance (temporarily ceasing operations) at the request of the grand chief of the cree first nation and did not re-start operations until the cree leadership were comfortable with the protocols instituted to keep work force and by extension, communities safe. despite the company's commitment to on-going engagement with communities and stakeholders, no assurances can be provided that increased stakeholder expectations will not result in adverse financial and operational impacts to the business, including, without limitation, operational disruption, increased costs, increased investment obligations and increased taxes and royalties payable to governments.
illegal mining and artisanal mining occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks.
artisanal and illegal miners have been active on, or adjacent to, some of newmont's african and south american properties, including in ghana, where illegal miners attacked a field team of security guards employed by a security contractor, tragically resulting in a fatality. illegal mining, which involves trespass into the development or operating area of the mine, is both a security and safety issue, which may present a security threat to property and human life. the illegal miners from time to time have clashed with security staff and law enforcement personnel who have attempted to move them away from the facilities. although, under certain circumstances, artisanal mining may be a legally sanctioned activity, artisanal mining is also associated with a number of negative impacts, including environmental degradation, poor working practices, erosion of civil society, human rights abuse and funding of conflict. the environmental, social, safety and health impacts of artisanal and illegal mining are frequently attributed to formal large scale mining activity, and it is often assumed that artisanally-mined gold is channeled through large-scale mining operators, even though artisanal and large-scale miners normally have separate and distinct supply chains. these misconceptions impact negatively on the reputation of the industry. the activities of the illegal miners could cause damage to newmont's properties or result in inappropriate or unlawful use of force for which newmont could potentially be held responsible. the presence of illegal miners could lead to exploration and project delays and disputes regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits. illegal mining and theft could also result in lost gold production and reserves, mine and development stoppages, and have a material adverse effect on financial condition or results of operations or project development.
civil disturbances and criminal activities can disrupt business and expose the company to liability.
civil disturbances and criminal activities such as trespass, illegal mining, sabotage, theft, blockades and vandalism may cause disruptions and could result in the suspension of operations, delays to project development and negative impacts on exploration activities at certain sites. incidents of such activities have occasionally led to conflict with security personnel and/or police, which in some cases resulted in injuries including in ghana, peru, mexico and suriname. although security measures have been implemented by table of contents the company to protect employees, community members, property and assets, such measures will not guarantee that such incidents will not continue to occur in the future, or result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, decrease operational efficiency or construction delays, increase community tensions or result in liabilities or reputational harm to newmont. the manner in which the company's personnel, national police or other security forces respond to civil disturbances and criminal activities can give rise to additional risks where those responses are not conducted in a manner consistent with international and newmont standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights.
newmont takes seriously our obligation to respect and promote human rights, is a signatory to and active participant in the voluntary principles on security and human rights, and has adopted a sustainability and stakeholder engagement policy and human rights standard in-line with the un guiding principles on business and human rights. nonetheless, although the company has implemented a number of significant measures and safeguards which are intended to ensure that personnel understand and uphold these standards, the implementation of these measures will not guarantee that personnel, national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance. the evolving expectations related to human rights, indigenous rights, and environmental protections may result in opposition to our current and future operations, the development of new projects and mines, and exploration activities. such opposition may take the form of legal or administrative proceedings or manifestations such as protests, roadblocks or other forms of public expression against our activities, and may have a negative impact on our local or global reputation and operations. opposition by community and activist groups to our operations may require modification of, or preclude the operation or development of, our projects and mines or may require us to enter into agreements with such groups or local governments with respect to our projects and mines or exploration activities, in some cases, causing increased costs and significant delays to the advancement of our projects. for example, prior to our acquisition of the marlin mine in guatemala, the mine was the subject of numerous complaints of human rights violations and faced opposition from the community and from non-governmental organizations that resulted in an order from the inter-american commission on human rights to close the mine and contributed to the decision to close the marlin mine in 2017. in peru, our conga project faced opposition from anti-mining activists in 2011, after which we suspended construction on the project's mining facilities and eventually reclassified conga's reserves to mineralized material as the result of certain operating and construction permits expiring at the end of 2015. the failure to conduct operations in accordance with company standards can result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, increase community tensions, reputational harm to newmont or result in criminal and/or civil liability and/or financial damages or penalties.
our operations face substantial regulation of health and safety.
our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations governing worker health and safety across our operating regions and our failure to comply with applicable legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. future changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.
our mines are inspected on a regular basis by government regulators who may issue citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under local mining regulations. if inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures.
in addition to potential government restrictions and regulatory fines, penalties or sanctions, our ability to operate (including the effect of any impact on our workforce) and thus, our results of operations and our financial position (including because of potential related fines and sanctions), could be adversely affected by accidents, injuries, fatalities or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.
our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.
our exploration, development, mining and processing operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing land use and the protection of the environment, which generally apply to air and water quality, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species, hazardous waste management and reclamation. some of the countries in which we operate have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. we have made, and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals which may adversely impact our closure processes and operations.
increased global attention or regulation on consumption of water by industrial activities, as well as water quality discharge, and on restricting or prohibiting the use of cyanide and other hazardous substances in processing activities could similarly have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to increased compliance and input costs.
producing gold is an energy-intensive business, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. energy costs accounted for approximately 16 percent of our overall operating costs in 2020, with our principal energy sources being purchased electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and coal. such costs are increasing with increasing use of energy at our mines as certain operations, like borden, move towards electrification of the mine.
table of contents our operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy.
transitioning to a lower-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. depending on the nature, speed, focus and jurisdiction of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to the business.
a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change ("unfcc") held in paris in 2015, the paris agreement was adopted which was intended to govern emission reductions beyond 2020. newmont supports the unfcc goal of limiting global warming to "well below 2oc" and plans to transition its operations to meet this goal by 2030, with an aspiration of carbon neutrality by 2050. newmont plans to invest $500 million in climate change initiatives over the next five years to achieve this goal. inconsistent implementation or significant delay in the implementation of country-level policy related to the paris agreement is likely to increase the risk for future swings in regulatory impacts and rapid shifts to low carbon technologies.
policy and regulatory risk related to actual and proposed changes in climate- and water-related laws, regulations and taxes developed to regulate the transition to a low-carbon economy may result in increased costs for our operations, venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. regulatory uncertainty may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than originally estimated for new development projects and mine plans of existing operations.
our operations are subject to a range of physical risks related to climate change.
physical risks related to extreme weather events such as extreme rainfall, flooding, longer wet or dry seasons, increased temperatures and drought, increased precipitation and snowfall, wildfires, or more severe storms may have financial implications for the business. such events can temporarily slow or halt operations due to physical damage to assets, reduced worker productivity for safety protocols on site related to extreme temperatures or lightening events, worker aviation and bus transport to or from the site, and local or global supply route disruptions that may limit transport of essential materials, chemicals and supplies.
energy disruptions can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to production delays or additional costs to ensure business continuity through reliable sources on-site power generation. energy transmission and supply may be impacted by wildfires, such as those that occurred in australia in 2020, which may interrupt electrical power transmission lines to mine sites, and that may pose risks to on site facilities and energy generators, fuel dispensing systems and supplies. in jurisdictions that rely on purchased hydroelectric power, such as in ghana, extreme drought and extended dry seasons may impact the electric utility's water supplies needed to generate hydroelectric power purchased by the mine to run operations.
changes in the quantity of water, whether in excess or deficient amounts, may impact exploration and development activities, mining and processing operations, water storage and treatment facilities, tailings storage facilities, closure and reclamation efforts, and may increase levels of dust in dry conditions and land erosion and slope stability in case of prolonged wet conditions. increased precipitation, extreme rainfall events or increased snowfall may potentially impact tailings storage facilities through flooding of the water management infra-structure, exceeding surface water runoff network capacity, overtopping the facility, or undermining the slope stability of the structure. increased amounts of water may also result in extended periods of mine pit flooding, maintenance and storage facilities; or may exceed current water treatment facility capacity to store and treat water physical conditions resulting in an unintended overflow either on or off of the mine site property.
our company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.
newmont and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. this leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical instability and hydrological impacts. as our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced certain geotechnical failures at some of our mines, including, without limitation, at our operations in australia, ghana, peru, colorado and at ngm, in nevada. see also the risk factor under the heading "mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate in order to maintain operations" earlier in this section.
unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, may occur. for example, seismic activity, such as seismic activity experienced at our éléonore mine, surface or underground fires, such as the underground conveyor belt fire that resulted in a shutdown of the musselwhite mine facility in march of 2019, and floods, landslides and pit wall failures, can be difficult to predict. such conditions are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. such events may not be detected in advance.
table of contents in addition, newmont has numerous operational and closed tailings impoundments in a variety of climatic and topographic settings. in 2020, the company generated and deposited greater than 100 million tonnes of tailings. the failure of tailings dam and storage facilities and other impoundments at our mining sites could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. for example, in early 2019, the extractive industry experienced a large scale tailings dam failure at an unaffiliated mine, which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property, environmental and reputational damage. recognizing this risk, newmont continues to review our existing practices. however, no assurance can be given that these events will not occur in the future. see also the risk factor under the heading "we may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining" earlier in this section.
geotechnical or tailings storage facility failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs and other impacts, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
our operations may be adversely affected by rising energy prices or energy shortages.
our mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy. increasing global demand for energy, concerns about nuclear power and the limited growth of new energy sources are affecting the price and supply of energy. a variety of factors, including higher energy usage in emerging market economies, actual and proposed taxation of carbon emissions as well as concerns surrounding unrest and potential conflict in the middle east, could result in increased demand or limited supply of energy and/or sharply escalating diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and other energy prices. additionally, changes in energy laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, such as the proposed reform of the mexican energy market, may impact energy dispatch rules and the ability to access energy and sell excess energy. limitations on energy supply and increased energy prices could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flow.
our principal energy sources are electricity, purchased petroleum products, natural gas and coal. some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long distance transmission of power, and in some locations we compete with other companies for access to third party power generators or electrical supply networks. as our operations move towards lower greenhouse gas ("ghg") emissions targets, power sources and technology at our operations will continue to be evaluated. certain of our operations may become more dependent upon access to electrical power supply as certain mines, like borden, move towards electrification of the mine. a disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.
continuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining operations.
we recognize the right to clean, safe water and that reliable water supplies are vital for hygiene, sanitation, livelihoods and the health of the environment. water is also critical to our business, and the increasing pressure on water resources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our management approach. across the globe, water is a shared and regulated resource. newmont operates in areas where watersheds are under stress with limited supply, increasing population and water demand, and impacted water in various forms. current and long-term water risks include those that arise from our operations (e.g., the use of chemicals in processing) and events that we do not control (e.g., extreme weather and climate change). our management of water-related risks targets the specific areas in which we operate, and takes into consideration the physical environment and social and regulatory context. although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights, claims and contracts to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings or community negotiations relating to our water rights, claims, contracts and uses. water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the company's control. for example, the continuation of the below average rainfall or the occurrence of drought in southwest australia could impact our raw water supply at boddington. while we incorporated systems to address the impact of the dry season as part of our operating plans, we can make no assurances that those systems will be sufficient to address all shortages in water supply, which could result in production and processing interruptions. the loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities. laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely affecting our operations.
risks related to the jurisdictions in which we operate our operations are subject to risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions.
exploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and other risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions, including:
•potential instability of foreign governments and changes in government policies, including relating to or in response to changes of u.s. laws or foreign policies;
•expropriation or nationalization of property;
•restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds;

•restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold and other metals offshore for u.s. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold u.s. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts;
•import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold, silver, copper, zinc and/or lead;
•disadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory;
•royalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing investment agreements, contracts of work, leases, royalties and taxes, by governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of argentina, australia, canada, chile, the dominican republic, ghana, mexico, peru, suriname, the state of colorado and the state of nevada in the u.s.;
•changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in changes resulting from changes in political administrations, for example nevada gold mines could be impacted by the resolutions before the state of nevada legislature to amend the state constitution to increase mining taxes;
•risk of increased taxation related to impacts to government revenue as a result of covid-19;
•fines, fees, and sanctions imposed for failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate;
•risk of loss due to inability to access our properties or operations;
•other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights;
•delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits, mining or operating leases and other agreements and/or approvals;
•risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;
•claims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or indigenous communities;
•risk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, blockade, local artisanal or illegal mining, theft and vandalism;
•delays in obtaining or renewing collective bargaining or certain labor agreements;
•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the u.s. or other jurisdictions, including without limitation, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and the dodd-frank act;
•increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located;
•increased financing costs;
•currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation;
•foreign exchange controls;
•increases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our boddington operation where use of alternative ports is not currently economical, or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects;
•risk of disruption, damage or failure of information technology systems, and risk of loss and operational delays due to impacts to operational technology systems, such as due to cyber-attacks, malicious software computer viruses, security breaches, design failures and natural disasters;
•risk of loss due to disease, such as malaria or the zika virus, and other potential medical endemic or pandemic issues, such as ebola or covid-19, as a result of the potential related impact to employees, disruption to operations, supply chain delays, trade restrictions and impact on economic activity in affected countries or regions; and
•disadvantage and risk of loss due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain diseases and potential endemic health issues.
consequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.
new legislation and tax risks in certain operating jurisdictions could negatively affect us.
we have operations and conduct business in a number of jurisdictions, which may increase our susceptibility to sudden tax changes. for instance, a 12% export duty was imposed by the argentine government in 2018, revised down to 8% thereafter, which could affect our argentine operations. in the province of santa cruz, argentina, a new local procurement law was passed requiring table of contents extractive industries to procure at least 50% of their goods and services from registered local providers, which could further impact our operational results. in the state of zacatecas, mexico, environmental taxes became effective in 2017 with little direction as to how the taxes are to be calculated. see note 31 to our consolidated financial statements under the heading "commitments and contingencies - state of zacatecas' ecological tax." also, in mexico, a recently proposed federal fee on revenue generated from mining could impact our operations if passed. in the united states, at the federal and state level, regulatory changes which may be implemented in the area of tax reform remain uncertain and may adversely affect companies in the mining sector. for example, ngm could be impacted by the resolutions before the state of nevada legislature to amend the state constitution to increase mining taxes. taxation laws and other regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex, subject to varying interpretations and applications by the relevant tax authorities and subject to changes and revisions in the ordinary course. it is difficult to predict whether proposed changes to regulations will be passed or to what extend they will impact the company. any additional and/or unexpected taxes imposed on us could have a material and adverse impact on our company.
changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political and social attitudes in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our operations or profitability.
our operations may be affected in a number of ways by laws and regulations related, but not limited to: restrictions on production; price controls; export controls; import restrictions, such as restrictions applicable to, among other things, equipment, services and supplies, currency remittance, income taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of mineral claims, environmental legislation, land use, surface land access, land claims of local communities, water use, and mine safety. failure to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as partners with carried or other interests, any of which may adversely affect our operations or profitability.
in addition, as governments continue to struggle with deficits and concerns over the potential and actual effects of depressed economic conditions (including in connection with covid-19 impacts), many of them have targeted the mining and metals sector in order to raise revenue. governments are continually assessing the fiscal terms of the economic rent for a mining company to exploit resources in their countries. numerous countries have implemented changes to their mining regimes that reflect increased government control over or participation in the mining sector, including, but not limited to, changes of law affecting foreign ownership and takeovers, mandatory government participation in mining enterprises, taxation and royalties, working conditions, rates of exchange, exchange controls, exploration licensing, export duties, repatriation of income or return of capital, environmental protection, as well as requirements intended to boost the local economy, including usage of local goods and employment of local and community staff or contractors, among other benefits to be provided to local residents. the effects of the various requirements and uncertainties related to the economic risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions cannot be accurately predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
our operations at yanacocha and the development of our conga project in peru are subject to political and social unrest risks.
minera yanacocha s.r.l. ("yanacocha"), in which we own a 51.35% interest, and whose properties include the mining operations at yanacocha and the conga project in peru, has been the target of local political and community protests, some of which blocked the road between the yanacocha mine and conga project complexes and the city of cajamarca in peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. while recently roadblocks and protests have diminished and focused on local political activism and labor disputes, we cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. the recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect the conga project's development, other new projects in the area and the continued operation of yanacocha.
construction activities on our conga project were suspended in 2011, at the request of peru's central government following protests in cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. at the request of the peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project was reviewed by independent experts in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of conga. this review concluded that the environmental impact assessment complied with international standards and provided recommendations to improve water management. based on the company's internal project portfolio evaluation process, we do not anticipate developing conga in the next ten years. due to the uncertainty surrounding the project's development timeline, we have allocated our exploration and development capital to other projects in our portfolio. as a result, the conga project is currently in care and maintenance and we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell or find alternative uses for equipment and assets originally acquired for the conga project. should we be unable to develop the conga project or conclude that future development is not in the best interest of the business, we may consider sale of the project to a third-party or other alternatives for the project, which may result in a future impairment charge.
the central government of peru continued to support responsible mining as a vehicle for the growth and future development of peru in 2020. however, we are unable to predict whether the central government will continue to take similar positions in the future. previous regional governments of cajamarca and other political parties actively opposed the conga project in the past. we are unable to predict the positions that will be taken in the future and whether such positions or changes in law will affect new projects at yanacocha or conga. such changes may include increased labor regulations, environmental and other regulatory requirements, and additional taxes and royalties, as well as future protests, community demands and road blockages. we cannot predict future positions table of contents of either the central or regional government on foreign investment, mining concessions, land tenure or other regulation. any change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect the assets and operations of yanacocha or conga, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. additionally, the inability to develop conga or operate at yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our growth and production in the region.
in addition, in 2015, the peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the ministry of the environment ("minam"), issued water quality criteria and standards for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including yanacocha. these criteria modify the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. in response in february 2017, yanacocha submitted its proposed modification to the previously approved environmental impact assessment to the mining ministry ("minem"), which remained under review in 2020 and evaluation is expected in 2021. with the approval of a separate eia, the new water quality criteria and standards for beneficial uses have been set to be implemented in 2024. yanacocha expects to adapt the eia submission in order to reflect these new standards. in the event yanacocha is unsuccessful in implementing the modifications in compliance with new regulations and deadlines, it could result in fines and penalties relating to potential intermittent non-compliant exceedances. in addition, if accepted, the treatment options may result in increased costs. these impacts may adversely impact the future cost and financial performance of our operations in peru.
our merian operation in suriname is subject to political and economic risks.
we hold a 75% interest in the merian gold mine in the mid-eastern part of suriname. suriname has experienced political instability and uncertainty in the past which may continue in future years. in 2019, a criminal court found the previous president of suriname guilty of murder in absentia for the 1982 execution of 15 political opponents. the court sentenced him to 20 years in prison, subject to an objection by the accused. the court has started the proceedings to examine the objection, which is expected in the course of 2021. confirmation of the 2019 ruling by the court and the imprisonment of the previous president, who still has many political followers, also pose a risk to social unrest and may affect our operations. the newly elected government faced a country with high debts to foreign creditors that are difficult to meet and staggering inflation rates. in 2020, the significant devaluation of the surinamese dollar against the us dollar resulted in an increase of the prices of certain goods and services within suriname, including without limitation, the price of fuel, which had been subsidized by successive governments. these impacts and negative economic trends can cause social unrest, which may present risks for our operations in suriname.
operations and development in suriname are governed by a mineral agreement with the republic of suriname. the mineral agreement was approved by parliament and requires approval by parliament to change. while the government is generally considered by the company to be mining friendly, it is possible that the current or future government may adopt substantially different policies, make changes in taxation treatment or regulations, take arbitrary action which might halt operations, increase costs, or otherwise impact mining and exploration rights and/or permits, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on the company's future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and/or financial condition. for example, the temporary solidarity levy increases the corporate tax rate in suriname by 10% and vat rate by 2% for the remainder of 2021 and should not apply due to the terms of the mineral agreement. however, it is possible that the government may request changes to the mineral agreement in the future.
the government of suriname previously exercised an option to participate in a fully-funded 25 percent equity ownership stake in merian. suriname manages its participation through staatsolie maatschappij suriname n.v. ("staatsolie"), a surinamese corporation with the republic of suriname as sole shareholder. if staatsolie does not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability to make their capital commitments in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement our operations in suriname could be impacted. see the risk factor under the heading "future funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pay cash dividends or our ability to engage in share repurchase transactions." earlier in this section under "risks related to our business".
artisanal and illegal miners have been active on, or adjacent to, the merian mine in recent years. see the risk factor under the heading "illegal mining and artisanal mining occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks" earlier in this "risk factors" section for additional information.
our operations at ahafo and akyem in ghana are subject to political, economic and other risks.
newmont operates in ghana pursuant to a revised investment agreement ratified by ghana's parliament in 2015, which established a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for newmont operations in ghana, to 2025 for ahafo and 2027 for akyem. however, since early 2018, and to address budgetary pressures, the government of ghana has initiated measures to mobilize additional revenue from the mining industry and other sectors of the economy as it attempts to increase revenue collection through various tax investigations, proposed new fees and other vehicles. there has been an increase in anti-mining sentiment in ghana on the back of claims of the industry is not contributing its fair share to national development. these events may result in government claims that extra revenue is owed them by the company and other mining companies operating in ghana, resulting in increased revenue and tax initiatives. additionally, the government may grant artisanal mining rights or alternative mining rights, such as sand and gravel, in locations in which the company has land rights, but no active operations, impacting the company's non-operational land positions.
on december 24, 2018, two individual plaintiffs, who are members of the ghana parliament, filed a writ to invoke the original jurisdiction of the supreme court of ghana. on january 16, 2019, these plaintiffs filed documents outlining the details of the their case table of contents and served our operations in ghana along with the other named defendants, the attorney general of ghana, the minerals commission of ghana and 33 other mining companies with interests in ghana. the plaintiffs allege that the mining company defendants are not entitled to carry out any exploitation of minerals or other natural resources in ghana, unless their respective transactions, contracts or concessions are ratified by the parliament of ghana. our current mining leases are both previously ratified by parliament (our june 13, 2001 mining lease was ratified by parliament on october 21, 2008 and our january 19, 2010 mining lease was ratified by parliament on december3, 2015). the writ alleges that any mineral exploitation prior to parliament ratification is unconstitutional. the plaintiffs seek several remedies including an injunction precluding exploitation of minerals by any mining company without prior parliament ratification, and declaration that all revenue as a result of violation of the constitution should be recovered via cash equivalent. an adverse decision in these matters could affect our business and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
the peñasquito mine is subject to transportation risks that could have a negative impact on our ability to operate that mine.
concentrates containing combinations of gold, silver, zinc and lead are produced in large quantities at the peñasquito mine and loaded onto highway road vehicles for transport to in-country smelters or to sea ports for export to foreign smelters in markets such as asia, europe and north america. this type of process involves a high level of environmental and financial risk. we could be subject to potential significant increases in road and maritime transportation charges and treatment and refining charges. transportation of such concentrate is also subject to numerous risks including, but not limited to, delays in delivery of shipments, road blocks, terrorism, theft, weather conditions and environmental liabilities in the event of an accident or spill. we could be subject to limited smelter availability and capacity and could also face the risk of a potential interruption of business from a third party beyond our control, which in both cases could have a material adverse effect on our operations and revenues. smelting, refining or transportation contracts for the peñasquito mine's products may also not be entered into on acceptable terms or at all.
as an example of transportation risk, production was halted for part of 2019 at our peñasquito mine operations due to contractor and community blockades. further blockades could affect our operations and revenues from our peñasquito mine operations.
our business operations may be adversely affected by violence and crime in mexico.
various areas in mexico are affected by persistent violence and crime. incidents of criminal activity, trespass, theft and vandalism have occasionally affected our employees and contractors at our peñasquito mine located in north-central mexico. security incidents, in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our operations, including reclamation activities, especially if criminal activity and violence continue to escalate. in addition, our response to criminal activities can give rise to additional risks should they not be carried out consistently with international standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights. such incidents may halt or delay production, increase operating costs; result in harm to employees, contractors, visitors or community members; decrease operational efficiency due to employee absenteeism and other factors; increase community tensions or otherwise adversely affect our ability to conduct business.
our operations in argentina are susceptible to risk as a result of economic and political instability in argentina and labor unrest.
there continue to be risks relating to the uncertain and unpredictable political and economic environment in argentina, especially at the provincial level in santa cruz where our cerro negro mine is located. inflation remains a challenge in argentina and argentina's central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in 2019 and 2020 in an effort to stabilize the local currency. for information on argentina's foreign currency controls and their effect on our operations, see the section titled "foreign currency exchange rates" in item 7, management's discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations. maintaining operating revenues in argentine pesos could expose us to the risks of peso devaluation and high domestic inflation.
the economic environment in the province of santa cruz has improved during 2019, although it continues to be fragile. in december 2019, the new national government suspended financial covenants that had been agreed in 2017. while the suspension of financial covenants may reduce economic and social disruption in the province, we cannot predict whether future disruptions may occur. disruptions may include roadblocks by local communities and unions that could adversely affect access to, and operations at, the cerro negro mine.
in addition, during 2019 and 2020, we experienced work stoppages by miners represented by unions at the cerro negro mine. issues may arise in the future with the unions at the cerro negro mine that could lead to material disruptions that adversely affect our operations at the cerro negro mine.
risks related to our workforce our business depends on good relations with our employees.
production at our mines is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. due to union activities or other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work stops or table of contents other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. for example, during 2018, 2019 and into 2020, there have been work stoppages by miners represented by unions at our cerro negro and merian mine, which have disrupted operations. at december 31, 2020, various unions represented approximately 39% of our employee workforce worldwide. the terms and conditions contained in our ghanaian collective agreements are agreed through december 2022, with labor rates for 2020 to be calculated using a pay adjustment framework. in peru, our two labor agreements expire in march 2022 and march 2023. in suriname, we reached a two-year agreement for our merian mine with the union which will expire in 2021. in timmins, ontario, we renegotiated a three-year collective bargaining agreement for our porcupine mine with the united steelworkers union which will be in effect through october 2023. in mexico, the collective bargaining agreement for peñasquito was renewed in 2020 for two years, and expires in mid-2022. although we currently have a stable relationship with the workers and the union, and a strike in 2013 temporarily stopped the operation of the mine, the possibility of future disruptions in the evolving geopolitical and legal context remains a future risk. similarly, union activities at the company's joint ventures such as ngm in nevada, could impact financial performance. a failure to successfully enter into new contracts or resolve ongoing union complaints could result in future labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. future disputes at the company's operations, projects or joint ventures may not be resolved without disruptions.
we may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. in addition, we are dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness.
we depend upon the services of a number of key executives and management personnel. our success is also dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse personnel to execute on our strategy. there continues to be competition over highly skilled personnel in our industry. if we lose key personnel, or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse employees, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.
our business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. if we experience periods where our employees are unable to perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as covid-19), our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we have experienced temporary workforce disruptions and periods where we temporarily placed certain sites in care and maintenance. these events, or if similar events occur in the future, could have a material adverse impact on the business in the future.
we rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.
a significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. as a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:
•negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;
•new legislation limiting or altering the ability to utilize contractors or outsourced resources;
•the inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;
•reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;
•failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;
•interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;
•failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and
•problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues;
•liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors.
in addition, law and regulations relating to the use of contractors may vary in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and changes in legal and regulatory restrictions may also impact our ability to utilize contractors and outsourcing services. for example, in fall 2020, mexico's president proposed a bill significantly restricting certain subcontracting and outsourcing of personnel. such regulatory restrictions could impact our ability to use certain contractors and/or impact labor costs. the occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
table of contents legal risks our business is subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other extraterritorial and domestic anti-bribery laws and regulations, a breach or violation of which could lead to substantial sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of licenses or permits and other collateral consequences and reputational harm.
we operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws and heightened expectations of enforcement authorities may be in tension with certain local customs and practices. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other laws with extraterritorial reach, including the u.k. bribery act, and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. we have a business integrity and compliance program which includes our code of conduct, business integrity policy and other policies and standards, all of which mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws by the company and its affiliates and their personnel, and also by third parties when they are engaged on our behalf. our program also includes a well-publicized helpline for raising complaints, questions and concerns as well as processes for evaluating and investigating such concerns and assurances of non-retaliation for persons who raise concerns in good faith. we report regularly to the executive leadership team and the audit committee of our board of directors on such programs and the results of investigations conducted.
we could be held responsible if our internal control policies and procedures fail to protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, regulations and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the our affiliates, employees, agents or associated persons for which we might be claimed to be responsible. as such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. in addition, the compliance mechanisms and monitoring programs adopted and implemented by goldcorp prior to our acquisition of goldcorp in april 2019 may not have adequately prevented or detected possible violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the corruption of foreign officials act (canada) attributable to goldcorp prior to our acquisition of goldcorp and we may be held liable for any such violations. we occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in improper or unlawful conduct for which we might be held responsible. our policy when receiving credible information or allegations is to conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to evaluate that information, determine compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations and company policies and take such remedial steps as may be warranted. in appropriate circumstances, we communicate with authorities in the united states and elsewhere about those investigations and reviews. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to substantial sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of operating licenses or permits and other collateral consequences, and may damage the company's reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
title to some of our properties may be insufficient, defective, or challenged.
the sufficiency or validity of the company's rights, titles, or interests in and to its properties ("legal title") may be uncertain or challenged by third parties, including governmental authorities, indigenous or communal peoples, or private parties. for example, at our conga project in peru, we continue to seek resolution to a land dispute with local residents. in mexico, exploration and mining rights are granted through a mining concession, pertaining to the mineral estate, and do not include rights of ownership, possession, or access in or to the corresponding surface estate. such rights in and to the surface estate are acquired through purchase, lease, or easement from private parties, local communities, or governmental authorities. we enter into temporary occupation agreements ranging from five to 30 years with the ejido communities, which allow us to use the surface of the lands for our mining operations, and at any particular time we may be involved in negotiations to enter into new temporary occupation agreements or other surface access agreements or amend existing agreements. failure to reach new agreements or disputes regarding existing agreements may cause, blockades, suspension of operations, delays to projects, and on occasion, may lead to legal disputes.
in addition, certain australian and canadian properties are owned by indigenous peoples or are subject to certain inherent aboriginal rights, treaty rights, and/or asserted rights in and to their traditional territories, and our ability to acquire necessary rights to explore, develop, or mine these properties is dependent on agreements with them. in french guiana, ghana and suriname, our legal title may be subject to challenge based on the presence and activities of artisanal miners. see the risk factor under the heading "illegal mining and artisanal mining occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks" below for further information. a determination of insufficient or defective legal title or risks in connection with a challenge to our legal title could result in loss of legal title, litigation, insurance claims, the impairment, preclusion, or cessation of exploration, development, or mining operations, and potential losses affecting the company's business as a whole.
we are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.
we are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. if decided adversely to newmont, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could result in fees, penalties or liabilities that have a material adverse effect on our financial position or impact our prospects or operations. furthermore, to the extent we sell or reduce our interest in certain assets, we may give representations and warranties and indemnities customary for such transactions and we may agree to retain responsibility for certain liabilities related to the period prior to the sale. as a result, table of contents we may incur liabilities in the future associated with assets we no longer own or in which we have a reduced interest. in our industry, such costs and liabilities may include, without limitations, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities. for a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see note 31 to our consolidated financial statements.
we are a global business with operations in various jurisdictions. in the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the united states. our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.
as a publicly traded company listed on the nyse and tsx, the market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: (i) changes in gold, and to a lesser extent, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices; (ii) operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors or our financial outlook; (iii) developments in our business or in the mining sector generally; (iv) regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; (v) the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us; (vi) announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors; (vii) our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; (viii) the perception of the company's environmental, social and governance (esg) performance and its ability to deliver on esg commitments and expectations; (ix) response to activism; and (x) changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility. the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and the covid-19 pandemic has increased, and may continue to increase, volatility and pricing in the capital markets. these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
holders of our common stock may not receive dividends.
holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. we are incorporated in delaware and governed by the delaware general corporation law. delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. under delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock. an annualized dividend payout level has not been declared by the board of directors, and the declaration and payment of future dividends, including future quarterly dividends, remains at the discretion of the board of directors. our dividend framework is non-binding, and our board of directors may modify the dividend framework or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.

item 7.       management's discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)
the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of newmont corporation, a delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, "newmont," the "company," "our" and "we"). we use certain non-gaap financial measures in our md&a. for a detailed description of each of the non-gaap measures used in this md&a, please see the discussion under "non-gaap financial measures" within part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis. this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report.
the following md&a generally discusses our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for 2020 and 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. discussions of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for 2018 and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are included in item 7, management's discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations, in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019, filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 20, 2020, are incorporated by reference into this md&a.
overview newmont is the world's leading gold company and is the only gold company included in the s&p 500 index and the fortune 500 list of companies. we have been included in the dow jones sustainability index-world since 2007 and have adopted the world gold council's conflict-free gold policy. in 2020, for the sixth year in a row, newmont was ranked as the mining and metal sector's top gold miner by the sam s&p corporate sustainability assessment. newmont was ranked the top miner in june 2020 in 3bl media's 100 best corporate citizens list which ranks the 1,000 largest publicly traded u.s. companies on environmental, social and governance ("esg") transparency and performance. we are primarily engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties, some of which may contain copper, silver, lead, zinc or other metals. we have significant operations and/or assets in the united states ("u.s."), canada, mexico, dominican republic, peru, suriname, argentina, chile, australia and ghana. our goal is to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining.
during the first half of 2020, the covid-19 outbreak escalated to a global pandemic, which has had varying impacts in the jurisdictions in which we operate. in response, the company temporarily placed five sites into care and maintenance, including musselwhite, éléonore, yanacocha and cerro negro in march 2020 and peñasquito in april 2020. during the second quarter of 2020, we worked closely with local stakeholders to resume operations at all five mine sites. as of december 31, 2020, all sites were fully operational, with the exception of cerro negro that continues to progress its ramp up.

in 2019, net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to newmont stockholders was $2,877, primarily as a result of the noncash gain recognized on the formation of ngm of $2,390 (see note 32 to the consolidated financial statements). after adjusting for this gain, net income in 2020, increased $2,179 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to higher realized gold, copper and silver prices, gains on asset and investment sales due to the sales of kalgoorlie, continental gold, inc. ("continental"), certain royalty interests and red lake, higher silver, lead and zinc sales volumes and higher equity income from affiliates due to a full year of activity following the newmont goldcorp transaction in 2019, lower goldcorp and nevada jv transaction costs and lower general and administrative expenses. these increases were partially offset by covid-19 impacts including lower sales volumes primarily in south america and care and maintenance costs due to certain sites experiencing reduced operations and other incremental costs in response to the pandemic, lower gold sales volumes due to the sale of kalgoorlie and red lake during 2020, and higher depreciation and amortization expense from the formation of ngm and a full year of activity following the newmont goldcorp transaction in 2019. for discussion regarding variations in production volumes and unit cost metrics, see results of consolidated operations below.
the details of our sales are set forth below. see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

the increase in gold sales during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, is primarily due to higher average realized gold prices and higher ounces sold at (i) peñasquito due to the blockade reducing production for a portion of 2019, (ii) musselwhite due to the fire halting operations in the prior year and (iii) porcupine and ahafo due to borden and ahafo mill expansion, respectively, achieving commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by lower ounces sold due to certain operations being placed into care and maintenance or experiencing reduced operations in response to the covid-19 pandemic, in addition to the sale of red lake and kalgoorlie during 2020.
the decrease in copper sales during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, is primarily due to copper being produced as a by-product at phoenix upon the formation of ngm on july 1, 2019, compared to a co-product for the first six months of 2019 and lower ore grade milled at boddington, partially offset by higher average realized copper prices and higher mill throughput at boddington.
the increase in silver sales during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, is primarily due to higher ounces sold at peñasquito due to the blockade in the prior year reducing production and sales, a full year of operations in 2020 as compared to nine months in 2019 and higher average realized silver prices, partially offset by peñasquito being placed into care and maintenance during a portion of 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic.
table of contents the increase in lead sales during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, is primarily due to higher pounds sold at peñasquito due to the blockade in the prior year reducing production and a full year of operations in 2020 as compared to nine months in 2019, partially offset by lower average realized lead prices and peñasquito being placed into care and maintenance during a portion of 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic.
the increase in zinc sales during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, are primarily due to higher pounds sold at peñasquito due to the blockade in the prior year reducing production and a full year of operations in 2020 as compared to nine months in 2019, partially offset by peñasquito being placed into care and maintenance during a portion of 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic.

____________________________
(1)n.m. - not meaningful the increase in depreciation and amortization for gold during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense from the formation of ngm and a full year of activity following the newmont goldcorp transaction in 2019 and higher ounces sold at (i) peñasquito due to the blockade reducing production for a portion of 2019, (ii) musselwhite due to the fire halting operations in the prior year and (iii) porcupine and ahafo due to borden and ahafo mill expansion, respectively, achieving commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by lower ounces sold due to certain operations being placed into care and maintenance or experiencing reduced operations in response to the covid-19 pandemic, in addition to the sale of red lake and kalgoorlie during 2020.
the decrease in depreciation and amortization for copper for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, is primarily due to copper being produced as a by-product at phoenix upon the formation of ngm on july 1, 2019, compared to a co-product for the first six months of 2019.
the increases in depreciation and amortization for silver, lead and zinc during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, is primarily due to the increased production at peñasquito due to the blockade in the prior year reducing production and a full year of operations in 2020 as compared to nine months in 2019, partially offset by peñasquito being placed into care and maintenance during a portion of 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic.
for discussion regarding variations in operations, see results of consolidated operations below.
reclamation and remediation expense was $366, $280 and $163 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. reclamation and remediation expense increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to higher reclamation adjustments at inactive yanacocha sites related to increased lime consumption and water treatment costs, partially offset by lower remediation adjustments at midnite mine, dawn mill and con mine sites.
exploration expense was $187, $265 and $197 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. exploration expense decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the temporary suspension of exploration drilling activities due to the covid-19 pandemic.
advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and other project expenses that do not qualify for capitalization. advanced projects, research and development expense was $122, $150 and $153 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. advanced projects, research and development expense decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to lower spend in nevada following the formation of ngm and lower spend on various projects in africa.
general and administrative expense was $269, $313 and $244 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. general and administrative expense decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the progression of integration activities for the newmont goldcorp transaction and other cost reduction efforts. general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was 2.3%, 3.2% and 3.4% for 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.
table of contents impairment of long-lived and other assets was $49, $5 and $369 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. impairment of long-lived and other assets represents non-cash write-downs of various assets that are no longer in use.
care and maintenance was $178, $- and $- in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. care and maintenance represents direct operating costs incurred at musselwhite, éléonore, peñasquito, yanacocha and cerro negro when the sites were temporarily placed into care and maintenance or operating at reduced levels as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
other expense, net was $206, $295 and $29 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. other expense, net decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to decreases in costs associated with the newmont goldcorp transaction and the nevada jv agreement, partially offset by covid-19 specific costs incurred as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and higher settlement costs.
gain on formation of nevada gold mines was $2,390 in 2019 and represents the difference between the fair value of our 38.5% interest in ngm and the carrying value of the existing nevada mining operations contributed on july 1, 2019.
gain on asset and investment sales, net was $677, $30 and $100 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the change in 2020, compared to 2019, is primarily due to the 2020 sales of kalgoorlie in australia, our investment in continental and certain royalty interests. see note 10 for additional information on asset sales and note 20 for additional information on investment sales.
other income, net was $(32), $297 and $55 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. other income, net decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to pension settlement charges, an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in tmac, debt extinguishment charges and increased foreign currency losses, partially offset by larger increases in the fair value of investments in the current year.
interest expense, net was $308, $301 and $207 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. capitalized interest totaled $24, $26, and $37 in each year, respectively. interest expense, net increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to increased debt balances as a result of the newmont goldcorp transaction.
income and mining tax expense (benefit) was $704, $832, and $386 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the effective tax rate is driven by a number of factors and the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods will be primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) impacts of the changes in tax law; (iv) valuation allowances on tax assets; (v) percentage depletion; (vi) fluctuation in the value of the united states dollar and foreign currencies; and (vii) the impact of specific transactions and assessments. as a result, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, year to year. this trend is expected to continue in future periods. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.

during the third quarter of 2020, the nevada legislature passed three resolutions proposing amendments to the nevada constitution to modify provisions regarding the net proceeds of minerals tax. the proposed amendments, if enacted, could significantly increase the mining taxes paid by ngm. these resolutions will require further approvals over a multi-year process which would ultimately include a statewide vote. ngm has engaged stakeholders to discuss the potential impact of the resolutions, the fiscal requirements of the state, and the economic contributions of the nevada mining industry.
on march 18, 2020, the families first coronavirus response act ("ffcr act"), and on march 27, 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act ("cares act") were each enacted in response to the covid-19 pandemic. the ffcr act and the cares act contain numerous income tax provisions such as the accelerated recoverability of alternative minimum tax credits and relaxed limitations on the deductibility of interest and on the use of net operating losses. the company has analyzed this legislation and has determined that it has no effect on the income and mining tax benefit (expense). however, due to the provision accelerating the recoverability of alternative minimum tax credits, the company received a refund of all outstanding alternative minimum tax credits as of september 30, 2020.
in addition to the ffcr and cares acts, governments in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates, passed legislation in response to the covid-19 pandemic. the company has evaluated these provisions and determined there is no impact on the income and mining tax benefit (expense).
equity income (loss) of affiliates was $189, $95 and $(33) in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. equity income (loss) of affiliates increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to income of $193 from the pueblo viejo mine, which was acquired as part of the newmont goldcorp transaction. earnings before income taxes and depreciation and amortization related to the pueblo viejo mine ("pueblo viejo ebitda") was $434, $245 and $- for the year ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. pueblo viejo ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure. see "non-gaap financial measures" within part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis. for additional information regarding our equity income (loss) of affiliates, see note 13.
net income (loss) from discontinued operations was $163, $(72) and $61 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the change from 2020 to 2019 is primarily due to the change in fair value of the holt royalty obligation and option. refer to note 19 for additional information on the holt royalty obligation and option. for additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations $38, $(79) and $(39) in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the change is primarily due to net losses at yanacocha in the current year compared to net income in the prior year.
other comprehensive income (loss) was $49, $19 and $(11) in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to the change in pension and other post-retirement benefits.
results of consolidated operations newmont has developed gold equivalent ounces ("geo") metrics to provide a comparable basis for analysis and understanding of our operations and performance related to copper, silver, lead and zinc. gold equivalent ounces are calculated as pounds or ounces produced multiplied by the ratio of the other metals' price to the gold price, using the metal prices in the table below:

in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we safely placed the musselwhite, éléonore, yanacocha and cerro negro mine sites temporarily into care and maintenance during march 2020 and peñasquito in april 2020. during the second quarter 2020, operations at all five mine sites resumed. as of december 31, 2020, all sites were fully operational, with the exception of cerro negro that continues to progress its ramp up.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized $178 of cash and $88 of non-cash care and maintenance costs included in care and maintenance and depreciation and amortization, respectively.
during this period, our other mines continued to operate with robust controls, including heightened levels of health screening and testing to protect both our workforce and the local communities in which we operate. we have adopted a risk-based approach to business travel, are providing flexible and remote working plans for employees and are maintaining effective testing, contact tracing procedures and "social distancing" protocols. for the year ended december 31, 2020, we incurred $92 of incremental direct costs related to our response to the covid-19 pandemic, included in other expense, net, as a result of these and other actions taken to protect our employees and operations, and to support the local communities in which we operate.

2020 compared to 2019
yanacocha, peru. on march 16, 2020 the yanacocha operations were temporarily halted as the operations were placed on care and maintenance due to government travel restrictions in-country in response to the covid-19 pandemic. while in care and maintenance, limited personnel remained on-site to perform essential work, including security, water treatment, environmental protection and gold production continued from leach pads. in may 2020, milling operations resumed following the confirmation that the peru economic reactivation plan allowed surface mining. we recognized $27 of cash and $7 of non-cash care and maintenance costs included in care and maintenance and depreciation and amortization, respectively, at yanacocha in 2020. gold production decreased 35% primarily due to lower mill throughput as a result of the site being placed on care and maintenance, in addition to lower ore grade milled as a result of lower ore grade mined and lower leach production driven by lower tons placed on the leach pad. costs applicable to sales per gold ounce increased 35% primarily due to lower ore grade mined, higher strip ratio, higher gold-price driven royalties and higher leach pad inventory adjustments, partially offset by higher by-product credits from silver sales. depreciation and amortization per gold ounce increased 70% primarily due to higher depreciation rates as a result of quecher main achieving commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the impact of the site being placed on care and maintenance. all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce increased 47% primarily due to higher costs applicable to sales per gold ounce, care and maintenance costs and higher sustaining capital spend.
merian, suriname. gold production decreased 12% primarily due to lower ore grade milled as a result of lower ore grade mined, partially offset by higher mill throughput. costs applicable to sales per gold ounce increased 25% primarily due to lower ore grade mined and higher gold price-driven royalties. depreciation and amortization per gold ounce increased 24% primarily due to lower ounces sold as a result of lower ore grade mined. all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce increased 18% primarily due to higher costs applicable to sales per gold ounce, partially offset by lower sustaining capital spend.
cerro negro, argentina. cerro negro was acquired during the second quarter of 2019 as part of the newmont goldcorp transaction. on march 20, 2020 the cerro negro operations were temporarily halted as the operations were placed on care and maintenance due to argentina suspending all domestic flights and mass transportation in response to the covid-19 pandemic. while in care and maintenance essential activities to maintain infrastructure continued including environmental management, security and ground control. in early may, the operations began implementing a safe restart plan, remobilizing its workforce and limited milling activities resumed. we recognized $56 of cash and $30 of non-cash care and maintenance costs included in care and maintenance and depreciation and amortization, respectively, at cerro negro in 2020. gold production decreased 35% primarily driven by the operations being placed into care and maintenance, partially offset by twelve months of operations in 2020 as compared to nine months in 2019. costs applicable to sales per gold ounce increased 19% primarily driven by lower ore grade mined and lower by-product credits from silver sales. depreciation and amortization per gold ounce increased 91% primarily driven by the impact of the site being placed on table of contents care and maintenance and lower gold ounces sold. all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce increased 52% primarily driven by care and maintenance costs and higher costs applicable to sales per gold ounce.

(4)for the year ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, the phoenix mine in nevada produced 15 million and 32 million pounds of copper, respectively. the phoenix mine site was contributed to ngm, effective july 1, 2019, at which point copper became a by-product.
2020 compared to 2019
nevada gold mines. attributable gold production at nevada gold mines increased 88% primarily due to a full year of operations in 2020 as compared to six months of operations in 2019. costs applicable to sales per gold ounce increased 6% primarily driven by the capitalization of pre-production stripping at cortez in 2019 related to the crossroads pit and lower ore grades processed at turquoise ridge in 2020, partially offset by higher ore grades processed at long canyon. depreciation and amortization per gold table of contents ounce increased 1% primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization rates at cortez, partially offset by updated asset useful lives at carlin. all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce increased 2% primarily due to higher costs applicable to sales per gold ounce, partially offset by lower sustaining capital spend per gold ounce.

foreign currency exchange rates our foreign operations sell their gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc production based on u.s. dollar metal prices. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates do not have a material impact on our revenue since gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc are sold throughout the world in u.s. dollars. despite selling gold and silver in london, we have no exposure to the euro or the british pound.
foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profits to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies, including the australian dollar, the canadian dollar, the mexican peso, the peruvian sol, the argentine peso, the surinamese dollar and the ghanaian cedi. approximately 45%, 43% and 33% of costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the u.s. dollar in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including approximately 18% denominated in the australian dollar, 11% denominated in the canadian dollar, 10% denominated in the mexican peso, 3% denominated in the peruvian sol, 2% denominated in the argentine peso, 1% denominated in the surinamese dollar and a nominal amount denominated in the ghanaian cedi in the current year. variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar at our foreign mining operations decreased costs applicable to sales by $17 per ounce in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily in argentina.
our cerro negro mine, which was acquired as part of the newmont goldcorp transaction and is located in argentina, is a u.s. dollar functional currency entity. argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary environment with a cumulative inflation rate of over 100% for the last three years. on september 1, 2019, argentina's central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency, with additional controls enacted on may 29, 2020 ("currency controls"). these currency controls include conversion requirements of export proceeds to local currency, limits on exchanges to foreign currencies and the reintroduction of affidavits to verify foreign currency transactions comply with regulations. since the currency controls were enacted, the company is required to convert metal sales proceeds to the argentine peso within five business days from receipt of cash at cerro negro and obtain central bank approval for any dividends or distributions to the parent company. additionally, the company is required to pay foreign obligations using offshore funds prior to accessing the onshore foreign exchange market. while we have balances denominated in argentine pesos that relate to accounts payable and employee-related liabilities and tax receivables and liabilities, the majority of cerro negro's activity has historically been denominated in u.s. dollars. additionally, a component of the deferred tax liability is carried in argentine pesos, which is impacted by fluctuations in the argentine peso exchange rate. most recently, on september 16, 2020, argentina's central bank enacted a new resolution requiring companies to refinance, with at least a two year term, sixty percent of any debt maturing between october 15, 2020 and march 31, 2021. however, this resolution does not apply to intercompany debt and we do not hold any external debt at cerro negro. therefore, this newly enacted resolution, as well as other previously enacted currency controls, are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
our merian mine is located in the country of suriname, which has experienced significant swings in inflation rates for the last three years. on march 24, 2020, suriname's central bank enacted the act controlling currency transactions and transactions bureaus in an effort to stabilize the local currency (the "act"), which was subsequently halted by an interim order and deemed unconstitutional by the surinamese court. this act includes a provision on the repatriation of export earnings and restrictions on imports; however, newmont and the republic of suriname have a mineral agreement in place superseding these provisions. therefore, we do not expect there to be a current or future impact to our operations or financial statements. additionally, on september 21, 2020, the central bank of suriname adopted a controlled floating rate system and concurrently announced a significant devaluation of the surinamese dollar. while we have employee-related liabilities denominated in surinamese dollars, which are impacted by this devaluation, the majority of merian's activity has historically been denominated in u.s. dollars. therefore, the devaluation of the surinamese dollar is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview we have a disciplined cash allocation strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and generate long-term value for our shareholders. consistent with that strategy, we aim to self-fund development projects and make strategic table of contents partnerships focused on profitable growth, while reducing our debt and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.
during 2020, the covid-19 pandemic has had a material impact on the global economy, the scale and duration of which remain uncertain. in an effort to protect the health and safety of our workforce, their families and neighboring communities in which we operate, we put five mine sites temporarily into care and maintenance during march and april 2020, while the remaining sites continued to operate. we worked closely with local stakeholders to resume operations at all five mine sites during the second quarter of 2020. as of december 31, 2020, all sites were fully operational, with the exception of cerro negro that continues to progress its ramp up.
depending on the duration and extent of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, additional sites could be placed into care and maintenance; transportation industry disruptions could occur, including limitations on shipping produced metals; refineries or smelters could be temporarily closed; our supply chain could be disrupted; or we could incur credit related losses of certain financial assets, which could materially impact the company's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. as of december 31, 2020, we believe our available liquidity allows us to manage the near-term impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on our business.
in january 2021, the company announced that the board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion of common stock to be repurchased in the next 18 months. the company's management will continue to evaluate the extent to which the company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, based upon a variety of factors, including trading volume, market conditions, legal requirements, business conditions, impacts of the covid-19 pandemic and other factors.
in 2020, the board approved a dividend framework to share incremental free cash flow with shareholders at higher gold prices. the framework returns 40 to 60 percent of incremental attributable free cash flow to shareholders that is generated above a $1,200 per ounce gold price. this framework is non-binding and will be periodically reviewed and reassessed by the board of directors. the declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the full discretion of the board and will depend on the company's financial results, cash requirements, future prospects, covid-19 impacts and other factors deemed relevant by the board.
in 2020, the company and barrick entered into an agreement with pueblo viejo to provide additional funding of up to $1,300 ($520 attributable to newmont's 40% ownership interest) through a loan facility for the expansion of pueblo viejo's operations. under the terms of the agreement, the company and barrick will distribute funds based on their respective proportionate ownership interest in pueblo viejo. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
at december 31, 2020, the company had $5,540 in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1,423 was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in u.s. dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to u.s. dollars. at december 31, 2020, $440 of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents was attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to our peru and suriname operations, which is being held to fund those operations. at december 31, 2020, $1,187 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents ($764 attributable to newmont) was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. we expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with the withholding taxes. we believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities.
we believe our existing consolidated cash and cash equivalents, available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and cash generated from continuing operations will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, fund future growth, meet debt obligations, pay dividends, complete our stock repurchase program and meet other liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. at december 31, 2020, our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility was $2,928 and we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. we do not expect any limitations on our ability to access our revolving credit facility as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. we continue to remain compliant with covenants and there have been no impacts to-date, nor do we anticipate any negative impacts from covid-19, on our ability to access funds available on this facility.

net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations was $4,890 in 2020, an increase of $2,014 from the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily due to a higher average realized gold price, a decrease in costs related to the newmont goldcorp transaction and formation of ngm, a decrease in payments of accrued liabilities and an increase in collections on receivable balances, partially offset by an increase in care and maintenance expenses due to five sites being temporarily placed into care and maintenance for a portion of 2020.
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities of continuing operations was $166 in 2020, an increase in cash provided of $1,392 from the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily due to the sale of the kalgoorlie and red lake operations, the sale of our investment in continental and a reduction of capital expenditures for additions to property, plant and mine development in 2020, partially offset by net cash and cash equivalents acquired in the newmont goldcorp transaction in 2019 and lower return of investment from equity method investees related to pueblo viejo in 2020.
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities of discontinued operations was $(75) in 2020, an increase in cash used of $75 from the year ended december 31, 2019, due to the payment for the option to acquire mining and mineral rights subject to the holt royalty obligation as part of the kirkland agreement. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1,680) in 2020, a decrease in cash used of $1,097 from the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily due to lower debt payments and the issuance of 2030 senior notes in 2020 and the 2019 payment of a one-time special dividend related to the newmont goldcorp transaction, partially offset by higher regular dividends in 2020.
capital expenditures cash generated from operations is used to execute our capital priorities, which include sustaining and developing our global portfolio of long-lived assets. we consider sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. capital expenditures to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations, where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are considered non-sustaining or development capital. in addition, the company continues to evaluate strategic priorities and deployment of capital to projects in the pipeline to ensure it executes on its capital priorities and provides long term value to shareholders. the company's decision to reprioritize, sell or abandon a development project, which may include returning mining concessions to host governments, could result in a future impairment charge.
for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we had additions to property, plant and mine development as follows:

refer to our global project pipeline discussion above for additional details. refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and "non-gaap financial measures" within part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis for further information.
debt our future debt maturities include $550 in 2021, $492 in 2022, $414 in 2023 and $4,624 maturing at various times after 2023. see note 25 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. we generally expect to be able to fund maturities of debt from net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, current investments, existing cash balances and available credit facilities.
depending upon market conditions and strategic considerations, we may choose to refinance some maturing debt in the capital markets. in 2020, we completed a public offering of 2.25% senior notes that yielded $985 in net proceeds, which were used together with existing cash and cash equivalents, to repurchase portions of our 3.50% 2022 senior notes and 3.70% 2023 senior notes (including $99 of existing goldcorp notes) totaling approximately $1,000. in 2019, we completed a public offering of 2.80% senior notes that yielded $690 in net proceeds, which were used primarily to repay $626 outstanding balance on the 5.125% senior notes maturing in 2019.
table of contents see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
debt covenants our senior notes and revolving credit facility contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, leases, sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. furthermore, our senior notes and corporate revolving credit facility contain covenants that include, limiting the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets.
the corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring us to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.50% in addition to the covenants noted above.
at december 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with all existing debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults.
letters of credit and other guarantees in september 2013, the company entered into a committed letter of credit facility agreement ("lc agreement") with bnp paribas, new york branch ("bnp") which established a $175 letter of credit facility for a three year period, subsequently extended to september 30, 2020, to support reclamation obligations. in september 2020, the lc agreement terminated and the company entered into an uncommitted letter of credit facility agreement with bnp which established a $175 uncommitted letter of credit facility for a one-year period to support reclamation obligations.
we have off-balance sheet arrangements of $1,807 of outstanding surety bonds, bank letters of credit and bank guarantees (see note 31 to the consolidated financial statements). at december 31, 2020, $72 of the $3,000 corporate revolving credit facility was used to secure the issuance of letters of credit, primarily supporting reclamation obligations.
supplemental guarantor information in september 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec on form s-3 under the securities act, of 1933, as amended, which enables us to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants and units (the "shelf registration statement") from time to time at indeterminate prices, subject to the limitations of the delaware general corporation law, our certification of incorporation and our bylaws. under the shelf registration statement, our debt securities may be guaranteed by newmont usa limited ("newmont usa"), one of our consolidated subsidiaries. these guarantees are full and unconditional, and no other of our subsidiaries guarantees any security issued and outstanding. there are no restrictions on the ability of newmont, as issuer, or newmont usa, as guarantor (collectively, the "obligor group"), to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend, loan or otherwise. additionally, the cash provided by operations of the obligor group and all of its subsidiaries is available to satisfy debt repayments as they become due, except to the extent of any rights of noncontrolling interests. net assets attributable to noncontrolling interests were $837 at december 31, 2020. all noncontrolling interests relate to non-guarantor subsidiaries.
newmont and newmont usa are primarily holding companies with no material operations, sources of income or assets other than equity interest in their subsidiaries and intercompany receivables or payables. newmont usa's primary investments are comprised of its 38.5% interest in ngm and 51.35% interest in yanacocha. prior to july 1, 2019, newmont usa included certain operations from our existing nevada mining operations, which were contributed in exchange for our 38.5% interest in ngm. for further information regarding these operations, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and "results of consolidated operations" within part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis. for further information regarding newmont's other operations, see our consolidated financial statements and "results of consolidated operations" within part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis.
table of contents in addition to equity interests in subsidiaries, the obligor group's balance sheets consisted primarily of the following intercompany assets, intercompany liabilities and external debt. the remaining assets and liabilities of the obligor group are considered immaterial at december 31, 2020.

newmont usa's subsidiary guarantees (the "subsidiary guarantees") are general unsecured senior obligations of newmont usa and rank equal in right of payment to all of newmont usa's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of newmont usa's future subordinated indebtedness. the subsidiary guarantees are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of newmont usa to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
at december 31, 2020, newmont usa had approximately $5,855 of consolidated indebtedness (including guaranteed debt), all of which relates to the guarantees of indebtedness of newmont.
under the terms of the subsidiary guarantees, holders of newmont's securities subject to such subsidiary guarantees will not be required to exercise their remedies against newmont before they proceed directly against newmont usa.
newmont usa will be released and relieved from all its obligations under the subsidiary guarantees in certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:
•upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of a majority of the total voting power of the capital stock or other interests of newmont usa (other than to newmont or any of newmont's affiliates);
•upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of newmont usa (other than to newmont or any of newmont's affiliates); or
•upon such time as newmont usa ceases to guarantee more than $75 aggregate principal amount of newmont's debt (at december 31, 2020, newmont usa guaranteed $600 aggregate principal amount of debt of newmont that did not contain a similar fall-away provision).
newmont's debt securities are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of newmont to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities of newmont's non-guarantor subsidiaries. at december 31, 2020, (i) newmont's total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $6,702, none of which was secured (other than $671 of lease and other financing obligations), and (ii) newmont's non-guarantor subsidiaries had $6,280 of total liabilities (including trade payables, but excluding intercompany and external debt and reclamation and remediation liabilities), which would have been structurally senior to newmont's debt securities.
for further information on newmont's debt subject to the subsidiary guarantees, see note 25 to our consolidated financial statements.

____________________________
(1)debt includes principal of $6,080 and estimated interest payments of $3,579 on senior notes, assuming no early extinguishment.
(2)finance lease and other financing obligations includes finance lease payments of $926 and additional payments of $38 for finance leases that have not yet commenced.
(3)mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. the estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these reclamation and remediation liabilities are reflected here. for more information regarding reclamation and remediation liabilities, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
(4)contractual obligations for employee-related benefits include severance, workers' participation, pension and other benefit plans. pension plan benefit payments beyond 2030 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included.
(5)we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions.
(6)minimum royalty payments are related to continuing operations and are presented net of recoverable amounts.
(7)purchase obligations are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects.
(8)other includes service contracts and other obligations not recorded in our consolidated financial statements, as well as the norte abierto and galore creek deferred payment obligations accrued in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities.
environmental our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. we have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. we perform a comprehensive review of our reclamation and remediation liabilities annually and review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. at december 31, 2020 and 2019, $3,719 and $3,334, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing or development stage mineral properties, of which $164 and $125, respectively, were classified as current liabilities.
in addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $313 and $299 were accrued for such obligations at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $50 and $44, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. we spent $25, $31 and $39 during 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, for environmental obligations related to the former mining activities.
reclamation and remediation adjustments during 2020 primarily related to increased lime consumption and water treatment costs at inactive yanacocha sites and updated project cost estimates at inactive porcupine sites and midnite mine and dawn mill sites. reclamation and remediation adjustments during 2019 primarily related to increased water management costs at inactive yanacocha sites, updated project costs estimates at dawn, mule canyon and northumberland sites, increased water management costs at the con mine and higher reclamation and remediation costs from the newmont goldcorp transaction.
during the year ended 2020, 2019, and 2018, capital expenditures were approximately $23, $65, and $81, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations.
for more information on the company's reclamation and remediation liabilities, see notes 6, 25 and 31 to the consolidated financial statements.
forward-looking statements the foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this annual report, contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. for a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors that might impact forward-looking statements and other important information about forward-looking statements, see the discussion in forward-looking statements in item 1, business and item 1a, risk factors.
non-gaap financial measures non-gaap financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. unless otherwise noted, we present the non-gaap financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below. for additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization management uses earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") and ebitda adjusted for non-core or certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period ("adjusted ebitda") as non-gaap measures to evaluate the company's operating performance. ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by gaap, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. although adjusted ebitda and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of adjusted ebitda is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. the company believes that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. management's determination of the components of adjusted ebitda are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-gaap financial measures used by mining industry analysts. net income (loss) attributable to newmont stockholders is reconciled to ebitda and adjusted ebitda as follows:

adjusted net income (loss)
management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the company's operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations. the company believes the use of adjusted net income (loss) allows investors and analysts to understand the results of the continuing operations of the company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the sale of products, by excluding certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. adjustments to continuing operations are presented before tax and net of our partners' noncontrolling interests, when applicable. the tax effect of adjustments is presented in the tax effect of adjustments line and is calculated using the applicable regional tax rate. management's determination of the components of adjusted net income (loss) are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-gaap financial measures used by mining industry analysts. net income (loss) attributable to newmont stockholders is reconciled to adjusted net income (loss) as follows:

(9)settlement costs, net, included in other expense, net, primarily represents certain costs associated with legal and other settlements. amount is presented net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $(1).
(10)restructuring and severance, net, included in other expense, net, primarily represents certain costs associated with severance and legal costs. amount is presented net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $(3).
(11)the tax effect of adjustments, included in income and mining tax benefit (expense), represents the tax effect of adjustments in footnotes (3) through (10), as described above, and are calculated using the applicable regional tax rate.
(12)re-measurement due to the tax cuts and jobs act, included in income and mining tax benefit (expense), represents the re-measurement of our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to the reduced tax rate of 21%. amount reflects the final adjustments to the provisional re-measurement expense.
(13)tax restructuring related to the tax cuts and jobs act, included in income and mining tax benefit (expense), represents changes resulting from restructuring our holding of non-u.s. operations for u.s. federal income tax purposes. amount reflects the final adjustments to the provisional restructuring charge.
(14)valuation allowance and other tax adjustments, net, included in income and mining tax benefit (expense), predominantly represent adjustments to remove the impact of our valuation allowances for items such as foreign tax credits, alternative minimum tax credits, capital losses and disallowed foreign losses. we believe that these valuation allowances cause significant fluctuations in our financial results that are not indicative of our underlying financial performance. the adjustment is due to an increase to the valuation allowance on u.s. net operating losses, credit carryovers, and other u.s. deferred tax assets of $191, other tax adjustments of $(3), and a decrease to the valuation allowance on u.s. capital losses of $(15). total amount is presented net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $(15).
(15)adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share is calculated using diluted common shares, which are calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap.
free cash flow management uses free cash flow as a non-gaap measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. free cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations less additions to property, plant and mine development as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. the company believes free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the company's performance with its competitors. although free cash flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the company's calculation of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.
the presentation of non-gaap free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company's performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by gaap, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. the company's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. therefore, the company believes it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the company's consolidated statements of cash flows.
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which the company believes to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.

costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce are non-gaap financial measures. these measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and other metals by gold ounces or gold equivalent ounces sold, respectively. these measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap. other companies may calculate these measures differently.
the following tables reconcile these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures.

all-in sustaining costs newmont has developed a metric that expands on gaap measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-gaap measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations.
current gaap measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-gaap measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.
all-in sustaining cost ("aisc") amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap. other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in international financial reporting standards ("ifrs"), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to aisc. differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development (i.e. non-sustaining) activities based upon each company's internal policies.
the following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure:
costs applicable to sales. includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. we exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from costs applicable to sales ("cas"), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. cas includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. cas is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes depreciation and amortization and reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of cas on the consolidated statements of operations. in determining aisc, only the cas associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. therefore, the amount of gold cas included in aisc is derived from the cas presented in the company's consolidated statements of operations less the amount of cas attributable to the production of other metals at our peñasquito, boddington, and phoenix mines. the other metals cas at those mine sites is disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. the allocation of cas between gold and other metals at the peñasquito, boddington, and phoenix mines is based upon the relative sales value of gold and other metals produced during the period.
reclamation costs. includes accretion expense related to reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related asset retirement cost ("arc") for the company's operating properties. accretion related to the reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the arc assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with gaap. the accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. the allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and other metals at the peñasquito, boddington, and phoenix mines.
advanced projects, research and development and exploration. includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration. we note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations. as these costs relate to sustaining our production, and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the aisc measure. these costs are derived from the advanced projects, research and development and exploration amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations less incurred expenses related to the development of new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future. the allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and other metals at the peñasquito, boddington, and phoenix mines.
general and administrative. includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfill our obligations to operate as a public company. including these expenses in the aisc metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis.
care and maintenance and other expense, net. care and maintenance primarily includes direct operating costs incurred at the mine sites during the period that these sites were temporarily placed into care and maintenance in response to the covid-19 pandemic. for other expense, net we exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. furthermore, this adjustment to other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to net income (loss) attributable to newmont stockholders as disclosed in the company's non-gaap financial measure adjusted net income (loss). the allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and other metals at the peñasquito, boddington, and phoenix mines.
treatment and refining costs. includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. these costs are presented net as a reduction of sales on our consolidated statements of operations. the allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and other metals at the peñasquito, boddington, and phoenix mines.
sustaining capital and finance lease payments. we determined sustaining capital and finance lease payments as those capital expenditures and finance lease payments that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. we determined development (i.e. non-sustaining) capital expenditures and finance lease payments to be those payments used to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations where those projects will materially benefit the operation and are excluded from the calculation of aisc. the classification of sustaining and development capital projects and finance leases is based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. sustaining capital and finance lease payments are relevant to the aisc metric as these are needed to maintain the company's current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. the allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and other metals at the peñasquito, boddington, and phoenix mines.

accounting developments for a discussion of recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
covid-19 assessment in light of the covid-19 pandemic described above we have reviewed and evaluated our long-lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. as of december 31, 2020, we determined that no impairment indicators existed at the balance sheet date, as the pandemic-related restrictions are viewed as temporary and are not expected to have a material impact on the company's ability to recover the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, including those assets temporarily placed on care and maintenance during 2020.
we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis of our reporting units as of december 31, 2020 and concluded there was no goodwill impairment. during the year, five of our mine sites were placed in care and maintenance. in spite of this, the fair value of these mine sites were not materially impacted as the mines were placed into care and maintenance for a temporary period only, with all of them being fully operational as of december 31, 2020, with the exception of cerro negro which continues to progress its ramp up.
we have been closely monitoring the covid-19 pandemic and its impacts and potential impacts on our business. however, because of the changing developments with respect to the spread of covid-19 and the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, we are unable to predict the extent and duration of any potential adverse financial impact of covid-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operations. future developments could impact our assessment and result in material impairments to our long-lived assets or goodwill.
critical accounting estimates listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from the estimates we calculate due to changes in circumstances, global economics and politics, and general business conditions. a summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. we have outlined below those policies identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require the application of significant management judgment.
depreciation and amortization expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. facilities and equipment acquired as a part of a finance lease, build-to-suit or other financing arrangement are capitalized and recorded based on the contractual lease terms. the facilities and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the lesser of the lease terms or the estimated productive lives of such facilities. these lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine.
costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. at our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. at our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. all such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ("uop") method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves.
major mine development costs incurred after the commencement of production, that are capitalized, are amortized using the uop method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. to the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area.
capitalized asset retirement costs incurred are amortized according to how the related assets are being depreciated. open pit and underground mining costs are amortized using the uop method based on recoverable ounces by source. other costs, including leaching facilities, tailing facilities, and mills and other infrastructure costs, are amortized using the straight-line method over the same estimated future lives of the associated assets.
the calculation of the uop rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. these changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. if reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves.
the expected useful lives used in depreciation and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of depreciation and amortization calculations.
carrying value of stockpiles stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. we generally process the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of gold ore stockpiles may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. sulfide copper ores are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs, including applicable overhead and depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations and removed at each stockpile's average cost per recoverable unit as material is processed.
we record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals price assumptions that are applied to expected short-term (12 months or less) and long-term sales from stockpiles, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. the primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include declines in short-term or long-term metals prices, increases in costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. the significant assumption in determining the stockpile net realizable value for each mine site at december 31, 2020 is a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption will not result in a material write-down to the carrying value of the stockpiles.
other assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as long-term commodity prices and applicable u.s. dollar long-term exchange rates. if short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles. a high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.
refer to note 22 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stockpiles.
carrying value of ore on leach pads ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold, copper or silver. costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations. costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold or silver or pound of copper on the leach pad.
estimates of recoverable ore on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). in general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete.
although the quantities of recoverable metal placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of metal actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. as a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of metal on our leach pads. variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. the significant assumption in determining the net realizable value for each mine site at december 31, 2020 is a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption will not result in a material write-down to the carrying value of the leach pads.
other assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as a long-term metal prices. if short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to net realizable value.
refer to note 22 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding ore on leach pads.
carrying value of long-lived assets we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. significant negative industry or economic trends, adverse social or political developments, declines in our market capitalization, geo-technical difficulties, reduced estimates of future cash flows from our reporting segments or other disruptions to our business are a few examples of events that we monitor, as they could indicate that the carrying value of the company's long-lived assets, including development projects, may not be recoverable. in such cases, a recoverability test may be necessary to determine if an impairment charge is required.
for development projects, including our conga project which is discussed further below, we review and evaluate changes to project plans and timing to determine continued technical, economic and social viability of the projects. if the company determines to sell or abandon a project due to uncertainty from changes in circumstances related to technical, economic, social, political or community factors, or other evolving circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, then a recoverability test is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded.
an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment and their carrying amounts. fair value is typically determined through the use of an income approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. these approaches are considered level 3 fair value measurements. occasionally, such as when an asset is held for sale, market prices are used. we believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use.
the estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of our mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and our projections for long-term average metal prices. in addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable reserve estimates; estimated future closure costs; and the use of appropriate discount rates.
the significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at december 31, 2020 is a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, of up to approximately $2,500 before consideration of other value beyond proven and probable reserves which may significantly decrease the amount of any potential impairment charge.
other assumptions include proven and probable mineral reserve estimates, value beyond proven and probable reserve estimates, the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves, commodity-based and other input costs, future closure costs and discount rates unique to each operation, as well as a long-term metal prices and applicable u.s. dollar long-term exchange rates. refer to quantitative and qualitative disclosures.
as discussed above under depreciation and amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves which could impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets. the ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling.
events that could result in additional impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in future metal prices, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, increases in future closure costs, and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site cash flows.
refer to note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding impairments.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business acquisition. goodwill is allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment annually as of december 31, 2020 and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
the company generally elects to utilize the optional qualitative assessment for goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value. if it is determined that the fair value is more likely than not to be lower than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by determining the fair value of the reporting unit. the fair value of a reporting unit is determined using either the income approach utilizing estimates of discounted future cash flows or the market valuation approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. these approaches are considered level 3 fair value measurements. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. any impairment loss recognized in the current period is not reversed in the future periods. the company recognizes its pro rata share of goodwill and any subsequent goodwill impairment losses recorded by entities that are proportionately consolidated.
the estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess the fair value of a reporting unit are derived from the company's current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management's projections for long-term average metal prices. in addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates.
carrying value of conga we review and evaluate the company's conga development project for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. we have considered a variety of technical, economic, social and political developments related to the conga project during our evaluation of impairment indicators since november 2011, when construction and development activities at the project were largely suspended. project activities in recent years have focused on continued engagement with the local communities and maintaining and protecting existing project infrastructure and equipment through our active care and maintenance program. although we have reclassified conga reserves to mineralized material and reallocated exploration and development capital to other projects, we continue to evaluate long-term options to progress development of the conga project. from time to time, the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell or find alternative uses for equipment and assets originally acquired for the conga project that are currently in care and maintenance. we have reprioritized the yanacocha sulfides project ahead of the conga project and expect it to provide an improved path to the future development of the conga project through improved social and political acceptance in the neighboring area and region. the company also periodically updates the economic model for its conga project to understand changes to the estimated capital costs, cash flows, and economic returns from the project. as of december 31, 2020, we have not identified events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the conga project is not recoverable.
reclamation and remediation obligations reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. changes in reclamation estimates at mines that are not currently operating, as the mine or portion of the mine site has entered the closure phase and has no substantive future economic value, are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. we review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine.
remediation costs are accrued based on management's best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. changes in remediation estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. water treatment costs included in environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value as cash flows are readily estimable. all other costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value.
accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. any such changes in future costs, the timing of reclamation activities, scope, or the exclusion of certain costs not considered reclamation and remediation costs, could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required.
refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding reclamation and remediation obligations.
income and mining taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. this method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for us, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. we derive our deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. the financial statement effects of changes in tax law are recorded as discrete items in the period enacted as part of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, regardless of the category of income or loss to which the deferred taxes relate.
mining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. with respect to the earnings that we derive from the operations of our consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of our consolidated companies.
our operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. we are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income and mining tax benefit (expense). in certain jurisdictions, we must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is ultimately collectible.
valuation of deferred tax assets our deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. we record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. we review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. in determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence.
certain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. we look to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date or the expectation of future pretax losses and the existence and frequency of prior cumulative pretax losses.
we utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years. concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. however, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. we also consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis.
other factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to:
•earnings history;
•projected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices;
•the duration of statutory carry forward periods;
•prudent and feasible tax planning strategies readily available that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary difference;
•nature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and
•the sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors.
the company assesses available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. a significant piece of objective negative evidence is recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence including projections for future growth. on the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded in peru. the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail on the valuation allowance.
for additional risk factors that could impact the company's ability to realize the deferred tax assets, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
business combinations we recognize and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, while transaction and integration costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. any excess of the purchase consideration when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill. for material acquisitions, we engage independent appraisers to assist with the determination of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest, if any, and goodwill, based on recognized business valuation methodologies. an income, market or cost valuation method may be utilized to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interest, if any, in a business combination. the income valuation method represents the present value of future cash flows over the life of the asset using: (i) discrete financial forecasts, which rely on management's estimates of reserve quantities and exploration potential, costs to produce and develop reserves, revenues, and operating expenses; (ii) long-term growth rates; (iii) appropriate discount rates; and (iv) expected future capital requirements ("income valuation method"). the market valuation method uses prices paid for a similar asset by other purchasers in the market, normalized for any differences between the assets ("market valuation method"). the cost valuation method is based on the replacement cost of a comparable asset at the time of the acquisition adjusted for depreciation and economic and functional obsolescence of the asset ("cost valuation method"). the fair value of property, plant and mine development is estimated to include the fair value of asset retirement costs of related long-lived tangible assets. if the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurs, an estimate will be recorded. subsequent to the acquisition date, and not later than one year from the acquisition date, we will record any material adjustments to the initial estimate based on new information obtained that would have existed as of the date of the acquisition. any adjustment that arises from information obtained that did not exist as of the date of the acquisition will be recorded in the period the adjustments arises.

item 1a. risk factors our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our securities. the risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business.
risks related to the covid-19 pandemic our business is being adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to be adversely impacted, by the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic.
our businesses have experienced and continue to experience various degrees of disruption and reduced demand for certain of our products due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the covid-19 pandemic. the effects of covid-19 have included and could continue to include disruption of the operation or temporary closure of certain of our facilities or the facilities of our table of contents customers, suppliers or business partners as well as other disruptions in our supply chains. challenges resulting from the pandemic have impacted, and may continue to impact, the ability of many of our employees to work effectively, due to illness, quarantines, facility closures, changes in manufacturing processes to accommodate social distancing guidelines, remote working arrangements, or other government-imposed operating restrictions. we have experienced and may continue to experience increased costs as a result of these business and production disruptions. likewise, we have incurred and may continue to incur additional expenses related to implementing processes and procedures to comply with required operating restrictions and to enhance the safety of our facilities to protect the health of our employees.
our commercial businesses have been and may continue to be adversely impacted due to a general slowdown in demand for our general aviation products and services, recreational and other specialized vehicles and automotive products. we have experienced a decline in orders for our aviation products and services, as well as lower deliveries of commercial helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft because of reduced demand and travel restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. economic and other impacts from the pandemic may also result in future weak demand for our aviation and commercial helicopter products and services, the delay or cancellation of existing orders by our customers and lower flight hours, and consequently, lower demand for parts and maintenance. in addition, new regulations by u.s. or foreign governments and government agencies addressed to the aviation or travel industry could impose additional regulatory, aircraft security, travel restrictions or other requirements or restrictions related to the pandemic that could adversely impact demand for aircraft and rotorcraft or significantly reduce hours flown. as a result, our costs may further increase as a result of the covid-19 outbreak. these cost increases may not be fully recoverable, negatively impacting our profitability, and may continue even after the business environment has improved.
it is possible that the continued spread of covid-19 and actions taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak could also further cause disruption in our supply chain or in the operations of our business partners, impacting their ability to perform their obligations, which could impact our ability to perform our contractual obligations; cause delay by, or limit the ability of, the u.s. government and other customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us; and cause other unpredictable events. limitations on government operations could impact regulatory approvals such as export licenses that are needed for international sales and deliveries. in addition, there may be changes in our u.s. and foreign government customers' priorities as they confront competing budget priorities and more limited resources. these changes may impact current and future programs, government payments and other practices, procurements and funding decisions.
the outbreak of covid-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries. the resulting economic downturn, the severity and length of which cannot be predicted, may cause continued reduced demand for our products, delays or cancellations of customer orders, the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products, bankruptcies of our suppliers, customers or other business partners, adverse impact to investment performance of our pension plans and continued volatility in the global capital markets adversely impacting our access to capital. the extent to which the pandemic could impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity is highly uncertain and also will depend on future developments, most of which are outside our control. such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the disease, the development of treatments or vaccines, and the effects of actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak.
see also risks related to our finance segment under financial risks section below.
aerospace and defense industry risks demand for our aircraft products is cyclical and lower demand adversely affects our financial results.
demand for business jets, turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast. unexpected events, such as the covid-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted demand for our aircraft products and may continue to do so. therefore, future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated and/or less than previous period deliveries. similarly, there is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity, customer needs and credit availability. changes in economic conditions has in the past caused, and in the future may cause, customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled, deferred or cancelled. reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders previously has had and, in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
we have customer concentration with the u.s. government; reduction in u.s. government defense spending can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
during 2020, we derived approximately 30% of our revenues from sales to a variety of u.s. government entities. our revenues from the u.s. government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various u.s. government defense-related programs. the funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the u.s. government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling. although multiple-year contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements, congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis table of contents even though a program may continue for several years. consequently, programs often are only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations. further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the u.s. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as "continuing resolutions" rather than full-year appropriations. if we incur costs in advance or in excess of funds committed on a contract, we are at risk for non-reimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated. the reduction, termination or delay in the timing of funding for u.s. government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services from time to time has resulted and, in the future, may result in a loss of anticipated revenues. a loss of such revenues could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. significant changes in national and international policies or priorities for defense spending, as well as the potential impact of sequestration, could affect the funding, or the timing of funding, of our programs, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, because our u.s. government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the u.s. government is unable to make timely payments, we may need to finance our continued performance for the impacted contracts from our other resources on an interim basis. an extended delay in the timely payment by the u.s. government could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.
u.s. government contracts can be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions.
the u.s. government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. in the event of termination for the u.s. government's convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. a termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability, including but not limited to, all costs incurred under the contract plus potential liability for re-procurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount, less the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract. such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. if any of our contracts are terminated by the u.s. government whether for convenience or default, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts. we also enter into "fee for service" contracts with the u.s. government where we retain ownership of, and consequently the risk of loss on, aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts. termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. on contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the u.s. government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor. in addition, in the event that the u.s. government is unable to make timely payments, failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
as a u.s. government contractor, we are subject to procurement rules and regulations; our failure to comply with these rules and regulations could adversely affect our business.
we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of u.s. government contracts. these laws and regulations, among other things, require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation, define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based u.s. government contracts, and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information, covered defense information, and the exportation of certain products and technical data. new laws, regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones (including, for example, regulations related to cybersecurity) can significantly increase our costs, reducing our profitability. our failure to comply with procurement regulations and requirements could allow the u.s. government to suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time, reduce the value of existing contracts, issue modifications to a contract, withhold cash on contract payments, and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products, services and associated materials, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. a number of our u.s. government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the inspector general of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated u.s. criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, or bribery; the u.s. civil false claims act; or received a significant overpayment under a u.s. government contract. failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause, suspension and/or debarment, and potential fines.
as a u.s. government contractor, our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the defense contract audit agency (dcaa) and the defense contract management agency (dcma).
we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the u.s. government and its agencies such as the dcaa and dcma. these agencies review our performance under contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to u.s. government contractors. the systems that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, our accounting, estimating, material management and accounting, earned value management, purchasing and government property systems. if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts, forfeiture or reduction of profits, suspension or table of contents reduction of payments, fines, and, under certain circumstances, suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time. whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the u.s. government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business.
the use of multi-award contracts by the u.s. government increases competition, pricing pressure and cost.
the u.s. government increasingly relies upon competitive contract award types, including indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity and multi-award contracts, which have the potential to create greater competition and increased pricing pressure, as well as to increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids. in addition, multi-award contracts increase our cost as they require that we make sustained efforts to obtain task orders and delivery orders under the contract. further, the competitive bidding process is costly and demands managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors.
our profitability and cash flow varies depending on the mix of our government contracts and our ability to control costs.
under fixed-price contracts, generally we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur, and, consequently, any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us. changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts can adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, fixed-price contracts generally require progress payments rather than performance-based payments which can delay our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flows. under fixed-price incentive contracts, we share with the u.s. government cost underrun savings, which are derived from total cost being less than target costs; we also share in cost overruns, which occur when total costs exceed target costs up to a negotiated cost ceiling, but are solely responsible for costs above the ceiling. under time and materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. under cost-reimbursement contracts that are subject to a contract-ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance based, however, if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs. due to the nature of our work under government contracts, we sometimes experience unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns. under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.
strategic risks developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties.
to continue to grow our revenues and segment profit, we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets. our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services. delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products occur from time to time and could adversely affect our results of operations. these delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles, production changes to meet customer demands, unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products, coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed. we also could be adversely affected if our research and development efforts are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts. likewise, new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks, potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us. furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. a reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, our investments in equipment or technology that we believe will enable us to obtain future service contracts for our u.s. government or other customers may not result in contracts or revenues sufficient to offset such investment. the market for our product offerings does not always develop or continue to expand as we anticipate. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products. a significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors' products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
table of contents we have made and may continue to make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business.
we enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value. acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that, in some cases, have resulted, and, in the future, could result in our not achieving expected benefits. such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner; challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits; the risk that the acquired businesses' markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses' products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets; the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated; the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited; the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions; and the potential loss of key customers, suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses.
business and operational risks our business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats.
our information technology (it) and related systems are critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day processes. from time to time, we update and/or replace it systems used by our businesses. the implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems, resulting in productivity issues, including delays in production, shipments or other business operations. we also outsource certain support functions, including certain global it infrastructure services, to third-party service providers, and any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. in addition, as a u.s. defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including threats to our it infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information via phishing / malware campaigns and other cyberattack methods, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners. attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential, classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers, as well as other security breaches, are persistent, continue to evolve and require highly skilled it resources.
we maintain information systems incident management standards applicable to all our businesses intended to ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with information systems are communicated and acted on in a timely manner. our enterprise risk management program includes cyber risk/network protection mitigation plans, and our disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include processes intended to ensure that security breaches are analyzed for potential disclosure. additionally, we conduct periodic training for our employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of cyberattacks. further, our insider trading compliance program addresses restrictions against trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information in connection with a cybersecurity incident.
while we have experienced cybersecurity attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks, and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust. due to the evolving nature of security threats, the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated, and we may not always be successful in detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents. future attacks or breaches of data security, whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes, could disrupt our operations, cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information, exposing us to liability or regulatory action. such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources, increase costs that may not be covered by insurance, and result in reputational damage, potentially adversely affecting our competitiveness and our results of operations. products and services that we provide to our customers may themselves be subject to cyberthreats which may not be detected or effectively mitigated, resulting in potential losses that could adversely affect us and our customers. in addition, our customers, including the u.s. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands.
failure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance.
we rely on other companies to provide raw materials, major components and subsystems for our products. subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances. we depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations. our ability to meet our obligations to our customers could be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and cost-effective manner. likewise, the quality of our products could be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products, or from whom we acquire such items, do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers' expectations. our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. the risk of these adverse effects would likely be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material, product or service. in particular, in the aircraft table of contents industry, most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall type certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer. if a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts, then the manufacturer's production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design, manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor's part, resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft. such events may adversely affect our financial results, damage our reputation and relationships with our customers, and result in regulatory actions and/or litigation.
we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries that could adversely impact our business.
during 2020, we derived approximately 32% of our revenues from international business, including u.s. exports. conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the u.s. we maintain manufacturing facilities, service centers, supply centers and other facilities worldwide, including in various emerging market countries. risks related to international operations include import, export, economic sanctions and other trade restrictions; changing u.s. and foreign procurement policies and practices; changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements; potential retaliatory tariffs imposed by foreign countries against u.s. goods; impacts related to the voluntary exit of the united kingdom from the european union (brexit); restrictions on technology transfer; difficulties in protecting intellectual property; increasing complexity of employment and environmental, health and safety regulations; foreign investment laws; exchange controls; repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges; compliance with increasingly rigorous data privacy and protection laws; competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages; economic and government instability, acts of terrorism and related safety concerns. the impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.
additionally, some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific in-country purchases, technology transfers, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, as a condition for a contract award. these contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective. we also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs. in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the foreign corrupt practices act. although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives, consultants, joint ventures, business partners, subcontractors or suppliers, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
natural disasters or other events outside of our control may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may not be fully covered by insurance.
natural disasters, including hurricanes, fires, tornados, floods and other forms of severe weather, the intensity and frequency of which are being exacerbated by climate change, other impacts of climate change, such as rising sea waters, as well as other events outside of our control including public health crises or pandemics, power outages and industrial accidents, have in the past and could in the future disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. any of these events could result in physical damage to and/or complete or partial closure of one or more of our facilities, temporary or long-term disruption of our operations or the operations of our suppliers by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing or otherwise impacting our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events. the occurrence of any of these events could materially increase our costs and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
financial risks if our finance segment has difficulty collecting on its finance receivables, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
the financial performance of our finance segment depends on the quality of loans, leases and other assets in its portfolio. portfolio quality can be adversely affected by several factors, including finance receivable underwriting procedures, collateral value, geographic or industry concentrations, and the effect of general economic conditions such as the recent deterioration of the economy due to the impact from the covid-19 pandemic. the pandemic has resulted in disruptions in the ability of many of our customers to conduct business effectively because of illness, quarantines, government shut-down orders, facility closures, reduced customer demand or other restrictions. as a result, our finance segment has modified a significant number of the loans in its portfolio in order to provide temporary payment relief to its customers. in addition, the finance segment has provided extended payment relief to certain customers. these modifications will delay our ultimate recovery on these assets. in addition, a substantial number of the originations in our finance receivable portfolio are cross-border transactions for aircraft sold outside of the u.s. cross-border transactions present additional challenges and risks in the event of borrower default, which can result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables. should current economic conditions persist or worsen, our table of contents finance segment may have difficulty successfully collecting on its finance receivable portfolio, and as a result our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
we periodically need to obtain financing and such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.
we periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due, to support our operations and/or to make acquisitions. our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings. if we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various non-u.s. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the location of income among these different jurisdictions. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore, changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws, which could affect our profitability. in particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income, as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates. in addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability.
risks related to regulatory and legal matters we are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results.
as a global business, we are subject to laws and regulations in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. international sales and global operations require importing and exporting goods, software and technology, some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent import-export controls across international borders on a regular basis. for example, we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various u.s. government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the u.s., and we are not always successful in obtaining these licenses or authorizations in a timely manner. both u.s. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity. for example, both u.s. and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry, and they have previously and may in the future impose new regulations for additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions, including, for example, restrictions and/or fees related to carbon emissions levels. changes in environmental and climate change laws and regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including costs to defend regulatory reviews. new or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business, affect how we conduct our operations, adversely impact demand for our products, and/or limit our ability to sell our products and services. compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive. in addition, a violation of u.s. and/or foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions, such as denial of import or export privileges and/or debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business.
certain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues.
as a distributor of consumer products in the u.s., certain of our products are subject to the consumer product safety act, which empowers the u.s. consumer product safety commission (cpsc) to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. under certain circumstances, the cpsc could require us to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products, or potentially even discontinue entire product lines. we also may voluntarily take such action and, from time to time, have done so, but within strictures recommended by the cpsc. the cpsc also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for non-compliance with its requirements. furthermore, failure to timely notify the cpsc of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us. any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands. additionally, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations could be adopted in the future.
increased regulation related to global climate change could negatively affect our business.
increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions. if environmental or climate change laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon our business or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
table of contents we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims.
we are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business, including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions; government contracts; alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations; production partners; product liability; patent and trademark infringement; employment disputes; and environmental, safety and health matters. due to the nature of our manufacturing business, we are regularly subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products, including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot, driver or user error. in the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable, it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable. in addition, we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims. furthermore, we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and we could incur judgments, receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period.
intellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers.
intellectual property infringement claims are, from time to time, asserted by third parties against us or our customers. any related indemnification payments or legal costs we are obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses, our customers or other third parties can be costly. infringement claims also have resulted in legal restrictions on our businesses engaging in sales of allegedly infringing products. if such a restriction were imposed upon a material product line, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. in addition, we own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names, trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business. the inability to enforce these intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. additionally, our intellectual property could be at risk due to cybersecurity threats.
risks related to human capital our success is highly dependent on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce.
our success is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a workforce with the skills necessary for our businesses to succeed. we need highly skilled personnel in multiple areas including, among others, engineering, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, flight operations, business development and strategy and management. from time to time we face challenges that may impact employee retention such as workforce reductions and facility consolidations and closures. in addition, some of our most experienced employees are retirement-eligible. to the extent that we lose experienced personnel through retirement or otherwise, it is critical for us to develop other employees, hire new qualified employees and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge. competition for skilled employees is intense, and we may incur higher labor, recruiting and/or training costs in order to attract and retain employees with the requisite skills. we may not be successful in hiring or retaining such employees which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
the increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results.
our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by increasing costs and funding requirements related to our employee benefit plans. the obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is driven by, among other things, our assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used for future payment obligations. additionally, as part of our annual evaluation of these plans, significant changes in our assumptions, due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders' equity. also, changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans.
our business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues.
approximately 6,800, or 28%, of our u.s. employees are unionized, and many of our non-u.s. employees are represented by organized councils. as a result, from time to time we experience work stoppages, which can negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers, loss or delay of revenues and/or increased cost. the presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace. in addition, the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions. work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes; similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products. any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during 2020, the global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, known as "covid-19", led to worldwide facility closures, workforce disruptions, supply chain destabilizations, reduced demand for many products and services, volatility in the capital markets and uncertainty in the economic outlook. our operations experienced and continue to experience various degrees of disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the pandemic. while some of our commercial manufacturing facilities had temporarily closed during the first quarter of 2020 through the latter part of the second quarter due to reduced demand for certain of our products, substantially all manufacturing activities had resumed in the third quarter. in the second half of the year, our commercial businesses have generally experienced an increase in customer demand compared with the first half of 2020. however, demand has not returned to pre-pandemic levels.
in the first quarter of 2020, following the onset of the pandemic, we strengthened our cash position by issuing $650 million in senior debt and by borrowing $500 million under a new 364-day term loan credit agreement. we also temporarily suspended share repurchases and took other measures to reduce costs and conserve cash, including employee furloughs at many of our commercial businesses and at corporate headquarters, reducing capital expenditures and delaying certain research and development projects. in the second quarter, we continued most of the measures taken in the first quarter to reduce costs and conserve cash and initiated a restructuring plan at certain of our businesses to further reduce costs. during the remainder of the year, we continued our focus on managing our businesses through the impacts of the pandemic while investing in future products and technologies. key financial highlights for 2020 include:
•generated $833 million of net cash from operating activities from our manufacturing businesses.
•maintained a strong cash position with $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the year.
•invested $317 million in capital expenditures and $549 million in research and development projects.
•repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock.
while we expect our commercial businesses, which have been adversely impacted by the pandemic, to slowly recover with the broader economic recovery, we cannot reasonably estimate when customer demand for our products and services may return to pre-pandemic levels. there are many uncertainties regarding the pandemic, and we continue to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how it is impacting our customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. see item 1a. risk factors for additional risks and uncertainties related to the pandemic's impact on our business. the ultimate extent of the effects of the pandemic on the company and our consolidated financial position is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the length and severity of the pandemic, and such effects could exist for an extended period of time, even after the pandemic ends.
for an overview of our business segments, including a discussion of our major products and services, refer to item 1. business. a discussion of our financial condition and operating results for 2020 compared with 2019 is provided below, while a discussion of 2019 compared with 2018 can be found in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended january 4, 2020. the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.

table of contents revenues revenues decreased $2.0 billion, 15%, in 2020, compared with 2019. the revenue decrease included the following factors:
•textron aviation revenues were lower by $1.2 billion, largely due to lower citation jet and commercial turboprop volume of $916 million, reflecting a decline in demand related to the pandemic, and lower aftermarket volume of $337 million, reflecting lower aircraft utilization resulting from the pandemic.
•industrial revenues were lower by $798 million, largely due to lower volume in the fuel systems and functional components product line, primarily due to manufacturing facility closures in the first half of 2020, and lower volume and mix in the specialized vehicles product line, primarily reflecting a decline in demand related to the pandemic.
•bell revenues were higher by $55 million, due to higher military revenues of $225 million, largely reflecting spares and logistics support, partially offset by lower commercial revenues.
cost of sales and selling and administrative expense cost of sales decreased $1.3 billion, 12%, in 2020, compared with 2019, largely due to lower net volume and mix described above. the decrease in cost of sales was partially offset by idle facility costs of $142 million, primarily at the textron aviation segment, reflecting unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs attributable to abnormally low production levels resulting from the pandemic and temporary manufacturing facility closures, and a $55 million inventory charge related to the tru business discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenues decreased 290 basis points in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to lower margin at the textron aviation segment reflecting unfavorable impacts from the pandemic, including the idle facility costs and inventory valuation charges.
selling and administrative expense decreased $107 million, 9%, in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to cost reduction activities across our manufacturing segments, principally at the textron aviation and industrial segments.
special charges special charges of $147 million and $72 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily include restructuring activities and intangible asset impairment charges as described in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.

effective tax rate               (9.6%)       13.5%       11.7%
in 2020, the effective tax rate of (9.6)% was lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to an audit settlement with respect to certain state income tax returns that resulted in a $52 million benefit and the favorable impact of research credits. in 2019, the effective tax rate of 13.5% was lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to $61 million in benefits recognized for additional tax credits related to prior years as a result of the completion of a research and development tax credit analysis.
for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory tax rate, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
segment analysis we operate in, and report financial information for, the following five business segments: textron aviation, bell, textron systems, industrial and finance. segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense, certain corporate expenses, gains/losses on major business dispositions, special charges and an inventory charge related to the 2020 covid-19 restructuring plan, as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense. operating expenses for the manufacturing segments include cost of sales, selling and administrative expense and other non-service components of net periodic benefit cost/(credit), and exclude certain corporate expenses and special charges.
in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group, changes in revenues and segment profit for our commercial businesses typically are expressed in terms of volume and mix, pricing, foreign exchange, acquisitions and dispositions, inflation and performance. for revenues, volume and mix represents changes in revenues from increases or decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided and the composition of products and/or services sold. for segment profit, volume and mix represents a change due to the number of units delivered or services provided and the composition of products and/or services table of contents sold at different profit margins. pricing represents changes in unit pricing. foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign-denominated amounts into u.s. dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period. revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in acquisitions for a twelve-month period, while reductions in revenues and segment profit from the sale of businesses are reflected as dispositions. inflation represents higher material, wages, benefits, pension service cost or other costs. performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development, depreciation, selling and administrative costs, warranty, product liability, quality/scrap, labor efficiency, overhead, non-service pension cost/(credit), product line profitability, start-up, ramp up and cost-reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs.
approximately 30% of our 2020 revenues were derived from contracts with the u.s. government, including those under the u.s. government-sponsored foreign military sales program. for our segments that contract with the u.s. government, changes in revenues related to these contracts are expressed in terms of volume. changes in segment profit for these contracts are typically expressed in terms of volume and mix and performance; these include cumulative catch-up adjustments associated with a) revisions to the transaction price that may reflect contract modifications or changes in assumptions related to award fees and other variable consideration or b) changes in the total estimated costs at completion due to improved or deteriorated operating performance.

the finance segment has provided temporary payment relief through loan modifications at the request of certain customers and continues to work with certain customers to provide extended payment relief as needed. if the current economic conditions continue to persist or worsen, we may experience increased customer delinquencies, however, we believe our allowance for credit losses adequately covers our exposure on these loans as our estimated collateral values largely exceed the outstanding loan amounts. loan modifications and key portfolio quality indicators are discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
liquidity and capital resources our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups. the manufacturing group consists of textron consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the textron aviation, bell, textron systems and industrial segments. the finance group, which also is the finance segment, consists of textron financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group. our manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our finance group provides financial services. due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group's activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group's performance. to support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements.
key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below:

the unprecedented conditions surrounding the covid-19 pandemic led to volatility in the capital markets and uncertainty in the economic outlook, in addition to causing various degrees of disruption in our operations. in light of these conditions, we have strengthened our cash position since the onset of the pandemic by taking various measures to reduce costs and conserve cash, and by increasing our borrowings as discussed below. given our strengthened liquidity position and stabilization of the capital markets in the second half of 2020, we reactivated our share repurchase plan in the fourth quarter. we believe that we will have table of contents sufficient cash to meet our needs based on our existing cash balances, the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and the availability of our existing credit facility.
credit facilities and other sources of capital textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, of which up to $100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. we may elect to increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility to up to $1.3 billion by designating an additional lender or by an existing lender agreeing to increase its commitment. the facility expires in october 2024, subject to up to two one-year extensions at our option with the consent of lenders representing a majority of the commitments under the facility. at january 2, 2021 and january 4, 2020, there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were $9 million and $10 million, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility.
we also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities. in march 2020, we issued $650 million in sec-registered fixed-rate notes due june 2030, with an annual interest rate of 3.00%. in august 2020, we issued $500 million of sec-registered fixed-rate notes due march 2031 with an annual interest rate of 2.45%, the proceeds of which were used to repay $500 million of outstanding borrowings under a new 364-day term loan credit agreement entered into in april 2020.
in september 2020, the finance group's $150 million variable-rate loan due december 2020 was amended to extend its maturity date to september 2021, with an option to extend for an additional year. the annual interest rate was modified from the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus 1.125% to libor plus 1.55%, which is an annual interest rate of 1.70% at january 2, 2021.
manufacturing group cash flows cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized below:

financing activities           393         (439)         (1,738)
cash flows from operating activities were $833 million in 2020 compared with $960 million in 2019, a decrease of $127 million. the change in cash flows primarily reflected an $893 million year over year increase in cash used to settle accounts payable, principally at the textron aviation segment, and lower earnings, partially offset by a $753 million reduction in cash used for inventories, primarily at the textron aviation segment, a $299 million increase in cash flows from contract assets/liabilities, primarily at the bell segment, and other favorable improvements in working capital accounts.
net tax payments were $34 million and $120 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. pension contributions were $47 million and $51 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
in 2020 and 2019, investing cash flows included capital expenditures of $317 million and $339 million, respectively. cash flows provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily included $1.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $377 million of proceeds from borrowings against corporate-owned life insurance policies. these cash inflows were partially offset by $548 million of payments on long-term debt, $377 million of payments on borrowings against corporate-owned life insurance policies, and $183 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 4.1 million shares of our common stock under both a prior 2018 share repurchase plan and a 2020 share repurchase plan described below. in 2019, cash flows used in financing activities primarily included $503 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 10.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock under a 2018 share repurchase authorization and $252 million of payments on long-term debt, partially offset by net proceeds of $301 million from the issuance of long-term debt.
on february 25, 2020, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 25 million shares of our common stock. this plan allows us to opportunistically repurchase shares and to continue our practice of repurchasing shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under compensation and benefit plans. the 2020 plan has no expiration date and replaced the prior 2018 share repurchase authorization.
dividend payments to shareholders totaled $18 million in both 2020 and 2019. in 2019, dividends of $50 million received from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment.

the finance group's cash flows from operating activities were $13 million in 2020, compared with $34 million in 2019, a decrease of $21 million, primarily reflecting higher net tax payments and lower earnings. cash flows from investing activities primarily included collections on finance receivables totaling $128 million and $277 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, partially offset by finance receivable originations of $195 million and $184 million, respectively.
cash flows used in financing activities included payments on long-term and nonrecourse debt of $45 million and $51 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. dividend payments to the manufacturing group totaled $50 million in 2019.

consolidated cash flows from operating activities were $769 million in 2020, compared with $1.0 billion in 2019, a decrease of $247 million. the change in cash flows primarily reflected an $893 million year over year increase in cash used to settle accounts payable, principally at the textron aviation segment, lower earnings, and a $134 million net cash outflow from captive finance receivables, partially offset by a $726 million reduction in cash used for inventories, primarily at the textron aviation segment, a $299 million increase in cash flows from contract assets/liabilities, primarily at the bell segment, and other favorable improvements in working capital accounts.
net tax payments were $42 million and $121 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. pension contributions were $47 million and $51 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
in 2020 and 2019, investing cash flows included capital expenditures of $317 million and $339 million, respectively. cash flows provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily included $1.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $377 million from borrowings against corporate-owned life insurance policies. these cash inflows were partially offset by $593 million of payments on outstanding debt, $377 million of payments on borrowings against corporate-owned life insurance policies, and $183 million of share repurchases. in 2019, cash flows used in financing activities primarily included $503 million of share repurchases and $303 million of payments on outstanding debt, partially offset by $301 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.
captive financing and other intercompany transactions the finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned textron aviation aircraft and bell helicopters manufactured by our manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing. in the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties. however, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group. for example, when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group's statement of cash flows. meanwhile, in the manufacturing group's statement of cash flows, the cash received from the finance group on the customer's behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow. although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing. these captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows.

pension and postretirement benefits we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually, consistent with applicable laws and regulations; however, future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table. in 2021, we expect to make approximately $22 million of contributions to our funded pension plans. based on our current assumptions, which may vary with changes in market conditions, our current contribution for each of the years from 2022 through 2025 is estimated to be approximately $51 million under the plan provisions in place at this time.
other long-term liabilities other long-term liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs. payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management's assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals. the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience. certain other long-term liabilities, such as deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, and reserves for product liability, warranty, product maintenance and litigation, have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments.
purchase obligations purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity and delivery dates. approximately 42% of the purchase obligations we table of contents disclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the u.s. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.

critical accounting estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies. the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below. we believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. this section should be read in conjunction with note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, which includes other significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenues is related to long-term contracts with the u.s. government, including those under the u.s. government-sponsored foreign military sales program, for the design, development, manufacture or modification of aerospace and defense products as well as related parts and services. we generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for these contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.
approximately 75% of our 2020 revenues with the u.s. government were under fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts. to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit and could potentially incur a loss.
the transaction price for our contracts represents our best estimate of the consideration we will receive and includes assumptions regarding variable consideration as applicable. certain of our long-term contracts contain incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. these variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical performance, and all other information that is reasonably available to us.
due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total transaction price and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. in estimating total costs at completion, we are required to make numerous assumptions related to the complexity of design and related development work to be performed; engineering requirements; product performance; subcontractor performance; availability and cost of materials; labor productivity, availability and cost; overhead and capital costs; manufacturing efficiencies; the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials); and costs of satisfying offset obligations, among other variables. our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. we review and update our cost projections quarterly or more frequently when circumstances significantly change. when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
at the outset of each contract, we estimate an initial profit booking rate considering the risks surrounding our ability to achieve the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), schedule (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion. profit booking rates may table of contents increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract. conversely, the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks; and, as a result, our estimated costs at completion increase. all estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and, therefore, may affect the profit booking rate.
changes in our estimate of the total expected cost or in the transaction price for a contract typically impact our profit booking rate. we utilize the cumulative catch-up method of accounting to recognize the impact of these changes on our profit booking rate for a contract. under this method, the inception-to-date impact of a profit adjustment on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. the impact of our cumulative catch-up adjustments on segment profit recognized in prior periods is presented below:
(in millions)                  2020          2019          2018
gross favorable            $148          $173          $249
gross unfavorable          (76)          (82)          (53)
net adjustments             $72           $91          $196
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different revenues and/or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones.
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate a potential impairment of a reporting unit. a reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment, in which case such component is the reporting unit. in certain instances, we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics.
we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash flows. these cash flows incorporate assumptions for revenue growth rates, operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions, cost structure, anticipated net cost reductions, and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. the revenue growth rates and operating margins are based on our strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts. the long-term revenue growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate, as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve. the discount rates utilized in this analysis are based on each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed.
if the reporting unit's estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment, and no further analysis is performed. otherwise, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess carrying value over the estimated fair value amount. based on our annual impairment review, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the impairment test in the foreseeable future.
retirement benefits we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and international pension and postretirement plans for certain of our employees. beginning on january 1, 2010, we initiated actions to commence the closure of the pension plans to new entrants. we provide employees hired subsequent to these closures with defined contribution benefits. our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are calculated based on actuarial valuations. key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses or benefits include the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increases. we evaluate and update these assumptions annually.
table of contents to determine the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. for 2020 and 2019, the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 7.55%. for 2020, the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans, which represent approximately 90% of our total pension assets, was 7.75%. for 2021, to reflect the impact of current expectations of long-term market conditions on certain investment returns, we have assumed a long-term rate of return for our domestic plans of 7.25%. the change in this assumption will increase pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately $35 million.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. this rate should be in line with rates for high-quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long-term interest rates change. a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense. in 2020, the weighted-average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 3.36%, compared with 4.24% in 2019. for our domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 3.45% in 2020, compared with 4.35% in 2019. a decrease of 50 basis-points in this weighted-average discount rate in 2020 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately $64 million.
actuarial gains and losses, representing differences between the assumptions utilized to develop estimated obligations and actual results or experience, that exceed 10% of the higher of the market related value of assets or the benefit obligation in a year, are initially recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized over future years as a component of our annual benefit cost. we amortize actuarial differences over the average remaining service period of eligible employees. if all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive or are not accruing additional benefits, we amortize these differences over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. as of the end of 2020, almost all of the participants in one of our domestic plans, the textron master retirement plan (tmrp), are no longer active. beginning in 2021, actuarial gains and losses for this plan will be amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants. a change in the tmrp amortization period in 2021 from 7 years to 20 years will reduce pension cost by approximately $85 million. the deferral of these differences reduces the volatility of our annual benefit cost that can result either from year-to-year changes in the assumptions or from actual results that are not necessarily representative of the long-term financial position of these plans.
the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and has an important effect on postretirement liabilities. the 2020 medical and prescription drug cost trend rates represent the weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits. in 2020, we assumed a trend rate of 7% for both medical and prescription drug cost and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 5% by 2024 and then remain at that level.

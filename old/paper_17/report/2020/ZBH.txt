item 1a.   risk factors

we operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict.  our business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors.  in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.  the following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance.  additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may materially adversely affect us in future periods.  you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.
risks related to our business, operations and strategy the covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, our business, results of operations and financial condition, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.
our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as covid-19.  the global spread of covid‐19 has had, and we expect it to continue to have, an adverse impact on demand for our products, our sales, our operations, our supply chains and distribution systems, and our expenses, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, and governments have taken and may continue to take.  due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products as healthcare customers divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of covid-19.  during 2020, we experienced a significant decline in procedure volumes globally as healthcare systems diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing covid-19, and that decline has continued.  additionally, public health bodies around the globe have at times recommended delaying elective surgeries during the covid-19 pandemic, and patients, surgeons and medical societies are evaluating the risks of elective surgeries in the presence of infectious diseases, which we expect will continue to negatively impact demand for our products and the number of procedures performed.
as a result of the covid-19 outbreak, we have experienced significant business disruptions, including restrictions on our ability to travel and to distribute our products, temporary closures of, or limited operations at, certain of our facilities and the facilities of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, as well as reduction in access to our customers due to diverted resources and priorities and the business hours of hospitals as governments institute prolonged shelter-in-place and/or self-quarantine mandates.  the unprecedented measures to slow the spread of the virus taken by local governments and healthcare authorities globally, including the deferral of elective surgical procedures and social distancing measures, have had, and we expect them to continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  these disruptions have resulted in the following among other unfavorable outcomes:
•   lower revenues, profits and cash flows compared to historic trends, including a net loss recognized in 2020 and negative operating cash flows in the second quarter of 2020;

•   bad debt charges as a result of being unable to collect on our accounts receivable;

•   additional charges from operating our manufacturing facilities at less than normal capacity;

•   goodwill impairment charges; and

15
•   delays in certain strategic projects and investments, including our restructuring plans, which will delay or may eliminate the effectiveness of these strategic initiatives.

if preventative and precautionary measures and/or the distribution of vaccines do not curb the spread of covid-19, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may continue to be adversely affected.  prolonged disruptions that cause deferral of elective surgical procedures may result in the following among other potential negative outcomes:
•   net losses and negative operating cash flows;

•   excess inventory we cannot sell, which would result in increased inventory charges;

•   our customers returning inventory to us, which would result in a reduction to our net sales;

•   additional charges from operating our manufacturing facilities at less than normal capacity;

•   additional goodwill impairment charges;

•   failing to satisfy the covenants in our credit facilities, which may cause any outstanding amounts to be payable immediately and could affect our access to capital to fund our business; and

•   downgrades to our credit ratings, which could result in increased interest expense.

in addition, the covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and we expect it to continue to adversely affect, the economies and financial markets of many countries, which may result in a period of regional, national, and global economic slowdown or regional, national, or global recessions that could further negatively affect demand for our products as hospitals curtail or delay spending and individuals experiencing unemployment and/or a loss of healthcare benefits cancel or delay elective procedures, and could also increase the risk of customer defaults or delays in payments.  our customers may terminate or amend their agreements for the purchase of our products due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures or other reasons.  covid-19 and the current financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in these and other areas, present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, volume of business, results of operations and cash flows.  due to the uncertain scope and duration of the pandemic and uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we are unable to estimate the impacts on our operations and financial results.
our restructuring program may not be successful or we may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring initiatives.
in december 2019, our board of directors approved, and we initiated, a global restructuring program (the "2019 restructuring plan") with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities, which program is ongoing.  restructuring initiatives involve complex plans and actions that may include, or result in, workforce reductions, global plant closures and/or consolidations, product portfolio rationalizations and asset impairments.  additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiencies during transitional periods.  restructuring initiatives present significant risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring program, as well as management distraction. for more information on our restructuring program, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.  if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our success largely depends on key personnel, including our senior management, and having adequate succession plans in place. we may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business, which could harm our business.
our future performance depends, in large part, on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel, including our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense. our ability to attract and retain key personnel, in particular senior management, will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives. the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel, could harm our business. in particular, we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave, and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner.
16
effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions.
our acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:
•   unforeseen difficulties in integrating personnel and sales forces, operations, manufacturing, logistics, research and development, information technology, compliance, vendor management, communications, purchasing, accounting, marketing, administration and other systems and processes;

•   difficulties harmonizing and optimizing quality systems and operations;

•   diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;

•   unforeseen difficulties related to entering geographic regions where we do not have prior experience;

•   potential loss of key employees;

•   unforeseen risks and liabilities associated with businesses acquired, including any unknown vulnerabilities in acquired technology or compromises of acquired data; and

•   inability to generate sufficient revenue or realize sufficient cost savings to offset acquisition or investment costs.

as a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate.  these risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions.
the proposed spin-off of our spine and dental businesses may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the intended results.
on february 5, 2021, we announced our intention to pursue a plan to spin off our spine and dental businesses to form a new and independent, publicly traded company ("newco") through a tax-free distribution to our stockholders of publicly traded stock in newco.  we are targeting completion of the spin-off in mid-2022.  unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect this proposed spin-off, including but not limited to disruptions in general market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory, tax and works council approvals or clearances.  in addition, consummation of the proposed spin-off is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, final approval of our board of directors, the receipt of a favorable opinion and internal revenue service ("irs") ruling with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement with the sec.  therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the spin-off on the terms or on the timeline that we announced, or at all.
we will incur significant expenses in connection with the spin-off.  in addition, completion of the proposed spin-off will require significant amounts of management's time and effort which may divert management's attention from other aspects of our business operations.  the spin-off will also require modifications to our systems and processes used to operate our business.  we may experience delays, increased costs and other difficulties related to these modifications which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  following the spin-off, we will be a smaller, less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could adversely affect our operating results.  we may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the spin-off and following its completion, which could harm our business.
further, if the spin-off is completed, the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction, strategic and competitive advantages of each company, and future growth and other opportunities for each company may not be realized within the expected time periods or at all.  failure to implement the spin-off effectively could also result in a lower value to our company and our stockholders.
the proposed spin-off  may result in disruptions to, and negatively impact our relationships with, our customers and other business partners.
parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the spin-off, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us. our business relationships may be subject to disruption as
17
customers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us.  these disruptions could adversely affect our business, including adversely affecting our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the spin-off.
the spin-off could result in substantial tax liability.
we intend to obtain an opinion and an irs ruling as to the tax-free nature of the spin-off under the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. the opinion and ruling will be based, among other things, on various factual assumptions and representations we will make. if any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the opinion and ruling may be jeopardized. if the spin-off does not qualify for tax-free treatment for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to us and to newco stockholders could be substantial.
interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have manufacturing sites all over the world.  in some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants.  damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disaster-related events, vulnerabilities in our technology, cyber-attacks against our information systems or the information systems of our business partners (such as ransomware attacks), or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the qsr and good manufacturing practice requirements, equipment breakdown or malfunction, reductions in operations and/or worker absences due to the covid-19 pandemic or other health epidemics, or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products.  in the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand.  in the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals.  as a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by third-party suppliers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party suppliers and we outsource some key manufacturing activities.  certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.  in certain cases, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers' manufacturing processes.  a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products, such as due to one or more suppliers experiencing reductions in operations and/or worker absences due to the covid-19 pandemic or other health epidemics; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service.  to the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, including federal and state regulations on the use of ethylene oxide, or reductions in operations and/or worker absences due to the covid-19 pandemic or other health epidemics, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers, sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
moreover, we are subject to the sec's rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as "conflict minerals" (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries.  this rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.  in addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products.  we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our
18
due diligence procedures.  as a result, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data, including from data breaches, our business could be adversely affected.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure.  as a result of technology initiatives, expanding privacy and cybersecurity laws, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities.  in addition, some of our products and services incorporate software or information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy, and some products or software we provide to customers connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes.  we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and, as a result, we manage a number of third-party suppliers who may or could have access to our confidential information, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information of patients, employees and customers (collectively "confidential information").
our information systems, and those of third-party suppliers with whom we contract, require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, changing threats and vulnerabilities,  and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information.  in addition, given their size and complexity, these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidential information.
like other large multi-national corporations, we have experienced instances of successful phishing attacks on our email systems and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. we also are subject to other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, payment fraud or other cyber incidents.  in addition, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees who are able to work remotely are doing so, and malicious cyber actors may increase malware campaigns and phishing emails targeting teleworkers, preying on the uncertainties surrounding covid-19, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks.  our incident response efforts, business continuity procedures and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.  if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could:
•   lose existing customers, vendors and business partners;

•   have difficulty attracting new customers;

•   have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing;

•   suffer outages or disruptions in our operations or supply chain;

•   have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud;

•   have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals;

•   have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed;

•   incur increased operating expenses;

•   be subject to issues with product functionality that may result in a loss of data, risk to patient safety, field actions and/or product recalls;

•   incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach; or

•   suffer other adverse consequences.

while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful.  we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents; however, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated, frequent and adaptive. therefore, despite our efforts, we cannot assure that cyber-attacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future.  any significant breakdown, intrusion, breach, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
19
our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.
we operate in a highly competitive environment.  our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies.  to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies and improve existing products and technologies.  competition is primarily on the basis of:
•   technology;

•   innovation;

•   quality;

•   reputation;

•   customer service; and

•   pricing.

in markets outside of the u.s., other factors influence competition as well, including:
•   local distribution systems;

•   complex regulatory environments; and

•   differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

our competitors may:
•   have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

•   respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

•   undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

•   adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

•   be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.

any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
our marketing success in the u.s. and abroad depends significantly upon our agents' and distributors' sales and service expertise in the marketplace.  many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents' detailed knowledge of products and instruments.  a loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of:
•   evolving customer needs;

•   changing demographics;

•   slowing industry growth rates;

•   declines in the musculoskeletal implant market;

•   the introduction of new products and technologies;

•   evolving surgical philosophies; and

•   evolving industry standards.

without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time.  if that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer.  the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
•   properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

•   commercialize new products in a timely manner;

•   manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time;

20
•   differentiate our offerings from competitors' offerings;

•   achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

•   satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost procedures;

•   innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and

•   provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

in addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors:
•   entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

•   the need for regulatory clearance; and

•   uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production.  in addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.
if third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed.
we sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs.  these third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a product or service used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication.  third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and products.
in addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.  if third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels or change reimbursement models for hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets.  if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, including through political changes or transitions, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.
the ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs.  group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization's affiliated hospitals and other members.  if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer's products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement.  our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
21
financial, credit and liquidity risks we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations, and the phase-out, replacement or unavailability of libor and/or other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our indebtedness.
we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions.  at december 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was $8.1 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion at december 31, 2014.  as of december 31, 2020, our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months are expected to be $0.7 billion.  as a result of the increase in our debt, demands on our cash resources have increased.  the increased level of debt could, among other things:
•   require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•   limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•   restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;

•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

•   adversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase and our ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired;

•   adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and

•   limit our ability to apply proceeds from a future offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.

in addition, the interest rates applicable to certain of our debt obligations are based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the london interbank offered rate ("libor"), euro interbank offered rate ("euribor") and/or tokyo interbank offered rate ("tibor").  any increase in interest rates applicable to our debt obligations would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  further, in july 2017, the u.k.'s financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates to the ice benchmark administration limited (together with any successor, "iba").  in response to concerns regarding the future of libor, the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal reserve bank of new york convened the alternative reference rates committee ("arrc") to identify alternatives to libor.  the arrc has recommended a benchmark replacement waterfall to assist issuers in continued capital market entry while safeguarding against libor's discontinuation.  the initial steps in the arrc's recommended provision reference variations of the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr").  in november 2020, the iba announced a proposal that the cessation date for the submission and publication of certain tenors of u.s. dollar denominated libor (including one-, three-, six- and twelve-month libor) be extended to june 30, 2023.  at this time, it is not possible to predict whether sofr will attain market traction as a libor replacement, and it remains uncertain if libor in applicable tenors and applicable currencies will cease to exist after calendar year 2021, or whether additional reforms to libor may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for libor.  further, other central banks have convened working groups to determine replacements or reforms of other interest rate benchmarks, such as euribor, and it is expected, although not known, that a transition away from the use of certain of these other interest rate benchmarks will occur over the course of the next few years and alternative reference rates (such as the euro short-term rate (€str)) will be established or gain market acceptance.
certain of our debt obligations that are based on libor will mature before the end of 2021.  however, the revolving credit agreement that we entered into on november 1, 2019 (the "2019 credit agreement") has an initial maturity date of november 1, 2024.  in anticipation of libor's phase out, the 2019 credit agreement provides for alternative base rates as well as a transition mechanism for selecting a benchmark replacement rate for libor, with such benchmark replacement rate to be mutually agreed with the general administrative agent and our lenders.  there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with our lenders on any such replacement benchmark before experiencing adverse effects due to changes in interest rates, if at all.  we will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur.  accordingly, the potential effect of the phase-out, replacement or unavailability of libor, or the unavailability of any other interest rate benchmark such as euribor or tibor, on our cost of capital cannot yet
22
be determined.  further, the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we may have additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions.  significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  we are regularly under audit by tax authorities.  although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense.  for example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the "base erosion and profit shifting" project undertaken by the organisation for economic co-operation and development ("oecd").  the oecd, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.  these changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the results of the u.s. presidential election could lead to changes in tax laws that could negatively impact our effective tax rate.
prior to the recent u.s. presidential election, president biden proposed an increase in the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, increasing the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposition of an offshoring tax penalty, and a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income. if any or all of these (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
if our independent agents and distributors are characterized as employees, we would be subject to additional tax and other liabilities.
we structure our relationships with independent agents and distributors in a manner that we believe results in an independent contractor relationship, not an employee relationship. although we believe that our independent agents and distributors are properly characterized as independent contractors, tax or other regulatory authorities may in the future challenge our characterization of these relationships. further, we have been subject to lawsuits challenging the characterization of these relationships in recent years. changes in classification from independent contractor to employee can result in a change to various requirements associated with the payment of wages, tax withholding, and the provision of unemployment, health, and other traditional employer-employee related benefits. if regulatory authorities or state, federal or foreign courts were to determine that our independent agents or distributors are employees, and not independent contractors, we would be required to withhold income taxes, to withhold and pay social security, medicare and similar taxes and to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes. we would also be liable for unpaid past taxes and subject to penalties. as a result, any determination that our independent agents and distributors are our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results.
goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets.  at december 31, 2020, we had $9.3 billion in goodwill and $7.1 billion of intangible assets.  the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable.  as discussed further in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, in the first quarter of 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $612.0 million as a result of the adverse impacts from the covid-19 pandemic and a change in our reportable segments, and in the second quarter of 2020, we recorded $33.0 million of in-process research and development ("ipr&d") intangible asset impairments on certain ipr&d projects.  if the operating performance at one or more of our reporting units falls significantly below current levels, including if elective surgical procedures are deferred longer than our current expectations due to the covid-19 pandemic, if
23
competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline, or as a result of restructuring initiatives pursuant to which we reorganize our reporting units, we could be required to record additional impairment charges.  any write-off of a material portion of our goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.
global operational risks we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the u.s., which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.
we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2020 from outside the u.s.  we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations.  our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:
•   changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

•   changes in foreign regulatory requirements, such as more stringent requirements for regulatory clearance of products;

•   differing local product preferences and product requirements;

•   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•   diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the u.s.;

•   trade protection measures, import or export requirements, new or increased tariffs, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers, which may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our operating costs;

•   foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;

•   complex data privacy and cybersecurity requirements and labor relations laws;

•   extraterritorial effects of u.s. laws such as the fcpa;

•   effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the uk bribery act;

•   difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•   labor force instability;

•   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

•   political, social and economic instability and uncertainty, including sovereign debt issues.

violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.
a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan.  the u.s. dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.  significant increases in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro, the japanese yen, the swiss franc or other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective or may create additional financial obligations for us.  further, if the counterparties to the derivative financial instrument transactions fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from those transactions.
developments relating to the uk's exit from the eu could adversely affect us.
the uk ceased to be a member of the eu on january 31, 2020, commonly referred to as "brexit," and entered into a transition period which ended on december 31, 2020 (the "transition period"), during which terms for the future trading relationship between the eu and uk were negotiated.  on december 30, 2020, the uk and the eu signed the uk-eu trade and cooperation agreement, which applies provisionally (pending ratification by the council of the european union) with effect from the end of the transition period.  as of the end of the transition period, the uk and the eu became separate and distinct legal and regulatory jurisdictions.
24
brexit has resulted in certain new restrictions on the free movement of goods, services and people between the uk and the eu, through technical barriers to trade, rules of origin requirements, custom inspections, and/or migration restrictions.  in terms of medical products regulation and trade, the now separate uk and eu approval and regulatory regimes may, in the near term or over time, require us to make adjustments to our business and operations that could result in significant expense and take significant time to complete.  over time, brexit could also result in increasing regulatory and/or standards divergence between the uk and the eu, which could affect the clearance and approval of medical products in each or either jurisdiction.
despite the uk-eu trade and cooperation agreement, brexit and the perceptions as to its potential impact have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, business activity and economic conditions in the uk, europe and globally, and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets.
given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which we will be affected by brexit remains uncertain.  any of the potential negative effects of brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
legal, regulatory and compliance risks we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations relating to the development, design, product standards, packaging, advertising, promotion, postmarket surveillance, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent, unpredictable and complex. the products we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other supranational, national, federal, regional, state and local governmental authorities.  the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all.  delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs.
both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations and other supranational, national, federal, regional, state and local requirements globally.  compliance with these requirements, including the qsr, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda and other regulators, which may result in observations (such as on form 483), and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement.  if the fda or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such products, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.  the fda or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products, seizure of products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us.  the fda or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us, and/or recommend prosecution.  any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in august 2018, we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed non-conformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our warsaw north campus manufacturing facility.  as of february 14, 2021, this warning letter remained pending.  until the violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda as described above, the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the fda may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.
governmental regulations outside the u.s. continue to become increasingly stringent and complex.  in the eu, for example, the mdr is expected to become effective in may 2021 and will include significant additional premarket and post-market requirements.  complying with the requirements of this regulation requires us to incur significant expense.  additionally, the availability of eu notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited,
25
which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the mdr.  any such delays, or any failure to meet the requirements of the new regulation, could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements.
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the international standards organization.  if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.
if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
the sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical products companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny around the world.  our industry is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the false claims act, the anti-kickback statute, the stark law, the physician payments sunshine act, the food, drug, and cosmetic act and similar laws and regulations in the u.s. and around the world.  in addition, we are subject to various laws concerning anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters (including the fcpa), sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations.  violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the u.s., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including medicare, medicaid and veterans administration health programs.  these laws are administered by, among others, the doj, the oig-hhs, the sec, the ofac, the bureau of industry and security of the u.s. department of commerce and state attorneys general.
we are also subject to federal, state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal and protection of health-related and other personal information.  the fda has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices.  the fda and the dhs have also issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices, which vulnerabilities may apply to some of our current or future devices.
in addition, certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy, security and breach notification regulations promulgated under hipaa.  hipaa governs the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by hipaa "covered entities" and their "business associates."  covered entities are health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions.  a business associate is any person or entity (other than members of a covered entity's workforce) that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information.  hhs (through the office for civil rights) has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations.  on december 10, 2020, hhs issued an npr to modify the hipaa privacy rule.  separately, hhs (through the national coordinator for health information technology) issued a new rule, to be effective april 5, 2021, that will limit "blocking" of electronic health information.  we intend to monitor both the npr and the "information blocking" rule and assess their impact on the use of data in our business.
in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above, a number of u.s. states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of personal information, such as social security numbers, medical and financial information and other personal information.  these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by u.s. federal laws.  for example, several u.s. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals, and at times regulators, the media or credit reporting agencies, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information.  other state laws include the ccpa, which took effect on january 1, 2020.  the ccpa, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners.  a second law in california, the cpra, passed via a ballot referendum in november 2020.  the cpra expands the scope of the ccpa and establishes a new california privacy protection agency that will enforce the law and issue regulations.  the cpra is scheduled to take effect on january 1, 2023, with a lookback to january 1, 2022.  other states have considered and/or enacted similar privacy laws.  we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business.
outside of the u.s., data protection laws, including the gdpr in europe and the lgpd in brazil, also apply to our operations in those countries in which we provide services to our customers.  legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve.  the gdpr imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer eu personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and
26
supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year).  governmental authorities around the world have enacted similar types of legislative and regulatory requirements concerning data protection, and additional governments are considering similar legal frameworks.
the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements.  failure to comply with u.s. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices.  in the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients.  as discussed further in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom® acetabular component ("durom cup"), certain products within the m/l taper and m/l taper with kinectiv® technology hip stems and versys® femoral head implants, and the m2a-magnumtm hip system.  we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products.  any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend.  product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.
we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.
claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly.  at any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  as previously disclosed, in march 2019 we paid approximately $168 million related to an award of treble damages and attorneys' fees in a patent infringement lawsuit.
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, processes, methodologies and information.  we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and nondisclosure, license, assignment and confidentiality arrangements to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of third parties whose assets we license.  however, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property, may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use, misappropriation or theft of our intellectual property.  further, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage.  third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.  we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information.
in addition, intellectual property laws differ in various jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to change at any time, which could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.  in particular, a portion of our revenues is derived from jurisdictions where adequately protecting intellectual property rights may prove more challenging or impossible.  we may also not be able to detect unauthorized uses or take timely and effective steps to remedy unauthorized conduct.  to prevent or respond to unauthorized uses of our intellectual property, we might be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation or other proceedings
27
and we may not ultimately prevail.  any failure to establish, maintain or protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.
in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.  for example, as discussed further in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, there have been four shareholder derivative actions filed purportedly on our behalf against certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and insider trading, based on allegations that we made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or omissions about our compliance with fda regulations and our ability to continue to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate in the second half of 2016.  although we believe there are substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.  given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome.  we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.
risks related to our organizational documents and jurisdiction of incorporation anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, our restated by-laws and the delaware general corporation law may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.
these provisions provide for, among other things:
•   the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without further stockholder action;

•   advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;

•   certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; and

•   the prohibition on engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for three years after the time at which a person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met, as set forth in section 203 of the delaware general corporation law.

these anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party's offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders.  as a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.
our restated by-laws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.
our restated by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the state of delaware (or, if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated by-laws, as either may be amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine.  any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions.  this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.  alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in
28
respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.  certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes.  the following discussion, analysis and comparisons generally focus on the operating results for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019.  discussion, analysis and comparisons of the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.
executive level overview impact of the covid-19 global pandemic our results have been significantly impacted by the covid-19 global pandemic.  the vast majority of our net sales are derived from products used in elective surgical procedures.  as covid-19 rapidly started to spread throughout the world in early 2020, our net sales decreased dramatically as countries took precautions to prevent the spread of the virus with lockdowns and stay-at-home measures and as hospitals deferred elective surgical procedures.  this resulted in net sales declines of 9.7 percent and 38.3 percent in the first and second quarters of 2020, respectively, when compared to the same prior year periods.  in the third quarter of 2020, various levels of recovery in elective surgical procedures occurred resulting in net sales growth of 2.0 percent when compared to the same prior year period.  however, in the fourth quarter of 2020 we saw the pandemic worsen and elective surgical procedures were deferred again, especially late in the quarter.  this was particularly prevalent in emea.  as a result, our net sales declined in the fourth quarter of 2020 by 1.9 percent when compared to the same prior year period.
with the deferral of elective surgical procedures, we have taken prudent measures in an effort to maintain an adequate financial profile to have access to capital to fund the business during these unprecedented times.  in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we have temporarily reduced discretionary spending such as travel, meetings and other project spend that can be delayed with limited long-term detriment to the business, and we have temporarily suspended or limited production at certain manufacturing facilities.  however, to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain, or in our ability to meet our customer demands.
2020 financial highlights in 2020, our net sales decreased by 12.0 percent compared to 2019 due to the deferral of elective surgical procedures from the covid-19 pandemic.  we recognized a net loss of $138.9 million in the year ended december 31, 2020.  the loss was largely attributable to the impacts of covid-19, which caused lower net sales and was the primary driver behind $645.0 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.  the temporarily suspended or limited production at certain manufacturing facilities resulted in higher costs of products sold that relate to certain fixed overhead costs and hourly production worker labor expenses that are included in the cost of inventory when these facilities are operating at normal capacity.  pursuant to our 2019 restructuring plan, we also incurred higher restructuring and other cost reduction initiative expenses in 2020 when compared to 2019.  lastly, in 2020 we recognized net litigation-related charges of $159.8 million compared to net litigation-related charges of $41.5 million in 2019.  these unfavorable items were partially offset by savings from our 2019 restructuring plan and lower costs for travel, meetings and other projects due to covid-19.
2021 outlook we believe the covid-19 surges that occurred late in 2020 will continue to negatively impact our net sales in 2021.  however, at this time we are optimistic the rollout of vaccines around the world will change those dynamics and elective surgical procedures will be able to return to pre-pandemic levels at some point during 2021.  additionally, since the clinical need for many of our products does not go away, it is possible once patients and hospitals have confidence to return to elective surgical procedures the patient backlog from deferred procedures may have a positive effect on the underlying market growth.  however, the consequences of covid-19 continue to be fluid, and it is difficult to predict its ongoing impacts to our business and broader economic and market environments.
if the negative impacts of covid-19 on our net sales subsides, we believe we can improve our operating profit margin since our fixed costs would not increase proportionally to net sales.
32
results of operations we analyze sales by three geographies, the americas, emea and asia pacific, and by the following product categories: knees; hips; s.e.t.; dental, spine & cmft; and other.  this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments, which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals.  we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies.

demand (volume/mix) trends changes in volume and mix of product sales had a negative effect of 10.0 percent on year-over-year sales during the year ended december 31, 2020.  volume trends were negative in the first and second quarters of 2020 as the covid-19 pandemic resulted in the deferral of elective surgical procedures.  in the third quarter of 2020, we experienced various levels of recovery in elective surgical procedures, resulting in positive volume and mix compared to the same prior year period.  however, in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the pandemic surged, volume trends again were negative compared to the same prior year period in many regions and we expect this trend to continue into 2021 until vaccines or other preventative measures lessen the spread of infection and patient reluctance.
based upon country dynamics, volume changes varied by region in 2020.  in the americas, the u.s. volume trends varied from state-to-state depending on local infection rates and preventative measures.  in emea, stay-at-home measures were far more prevalent than other geographies, especially in the second and fourth quarters, resulting in emea volume and mix trends being the worst among our geographic regions for the full year.  in asia pacific, containment of the covid-19 virus varied from country-to-country, but overall volume and mix trends were positive in asia pacific in the second half of 2020 as our three largest markets of japan, china and australia/new zealand all had sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.   pricing trends global selling prices had a negative effect of 2.4 percent on year-over-year sales during 2020.  in the majority of countries in which we operate, we continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems.
foreign currency exchange rates in 2020, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive effect of 0.4 percent on year-over-year sales.  if foreign currency exchange rates remain at levels consistent with recent rates, we estimate they will have a less than 1 percent positive effect on sales in 2021 for the full year.

cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization we calculate gross profit as net sales minus cost of products sold and intangible asset amortization.  our gross margin percentage is gross profit divided by net sales.  the following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2020 and 2019 compared to the prior year:

the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to temporarily suspended or limited production at certain facilities, intangible asset amortization, lower average selling prices, excess and obsolete inventory charges and charges related to products we intend to discontinue.  the temporary suspension or limited production at certain manufacturing facilities resulted in us immediately expensing certain fixed overhead costs and hourly production worker labor expenses that are included in the cost of inventory when these facilities are operating at normal capacity.  intangible asset amortization and excess and obsolete inventory charges did not decline ratably with the significant decline in our net sales and therefore were a significant impact to our gross margin percentage.  the inventory charges on discontinued products are driven by overlapping product lines in our portfolio and we have plans to discontinue one of the product lines, or from decisions not to spend additional funds to keep certain products up-to-date with the latest quality standards or requirements, such as the european union medical device regulation ("eu mdr"), and so we have decided to discontinue those products.
operating expenses research & development ("r&d") expenses decreased in both amount and as a percentage of net sales in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to savings as a result of the 2019 restructuring plan and lower spending on travel and lower spending on certain project costs, including the eu mdr, due to covid-19.
selling, general & administrative ("sg&a") expenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, but increased as a percentage of net sales.  sg&a expenses decreased due to lower variable selling and distribution expenses from the decline in our net sales, covid-19 cost reductions for travel, consulting and other projects, savings from our 2019 restructuring plan and lower charges related to our compliance with the dpa.  these favorable items were partially offset by higher litigation-related charges in 2020 compared to 2019.  see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these litigation matters.  the increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales is due to various fixed expenses that did not decline ratably with the significant decline in our net sales.
in 2020, we recognized goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $645.0 million, including charges of $470.0 million and $142.0 million related to our emea and dental reporting units, respectively, and $33.0 million of intangible asset impairment charges.  in 2019, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $70.1 million.  for more information regarding these charges, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
in december 2019, our board of directors approved, and we initiated, the 2019 restructuring plan with an overall objective of reducing costs to allow us to invest in higher priority growth opportunities.  we recognized expenses of $116.9 million and $50.0 million in the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, attributable to restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives, primarily related to employee termination benefits, distributor contract terminations, and consulting and project management expenses associated with the 2019 restructuring plan.  for more information regarding these expenses, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
our quality remediation expenses declined in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the natural regression of completing our remediation milestones.  acquisition, integration and related expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the various acquisitions we made in 2020.
on february 5, 2021, we announced our intention to pursue a plan to spin off our spine and dental businesses to form newco.  we expect to incur significant expenses in 2021 to execute this plan.  the significant expenses primarily include third party consulting and project management to help us separate the legacy zimmer biomet and newco businesses and to comply with all the necessary actions needed for newco to become an independent, publicly-traded company. consummation of the proposed spin-off is subject to certain conditions, including final approval of our board of directors, the receipt of a favorable opinion and irs ruling with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement with the sec. therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the spin-off on the terms or on the timeline that we announced, or at all.
other income (expense), net, interest expense, net, and income taxes in 2020, we recognized income in other income (expense), net, compared to net expenses in 2019, primarily due to gains recognized from changes to the fair value of our equity investments and higher gains from certain components of pension expense in 2020.
interest expense, net, declined in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower average outstanding debt balances during 2020 resulting from debt repayments throughout 2019 and euro notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2019 that were used to refinance debt with higher interest rates.  despite continued debt repayments, our interest expense, net, may

increase in 2021 due to cross-currency interest rate swaps that will mature in 2021.  based upon current market conditions, if we decide to enter into new swaps when the previous swaps mature in 2021, the new swaps would not be as favorable to us compared to the maturing swaps.
our effective tax rate ("etr") on (loss) earnings before income taxes was 49.9 percent and negative 24.9 percent (a tax benefit was recognized on earnings before income taxes) for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  in 2020, the income tax benefit was driven by changes in estimates to uncertain tax positions, favorable tax audit settlements, jurisdictional mix of earnings and losses, and a $43.0 million tax benefit from switzerland's federal act on tax reform and ahv financing ("traf").  other significant impacts to the etr in 2020 included the $612.0 million goodwill impairment charge, which resulted in a loss before taxes, but had no corresponding tax benefit.
in 2019, we recognized an overall tax benefit in the year due to a $315.0 million benefit from switzerland's traf in addition to the tax impact of certain restructuring transactions in switzerland.  the traf was effective january 1, 2020 and includes the abolishment of various favorable federal and cantonal tax regimes.  the traf provided transitional relief measures for companies that are losing the tax benefit of a ruling, including a "step-up" for amortizable goodwill, equal to the amount of future tax benefit they would have received under their existing ruling, subject to certain limitations.
absent discrete tax events, we expect our future etr will be lower than the u.s. corporate income tax rate of 21.0 percent due to our mix of earnings between u.s. and foreign locations, which have lower corporate income tax rates.  our etr in future periods could also potentially be impacted by: changes in our mix of pre-tax earnings; changes in tax rates, tax laws or their interpretation, including the european union rules on state aid; the outcome of various federal, state and foreign audits; and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.  currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results.

in 2020, the net sales and operating profit of all of our operating segments were adversely affected by the covid-19 pandemic.  in 2020, the operating profit as a percentage of net sales for each of our segments declined compared to prior years due to the effect of fixed operating expenses that did not decline proportionally with lower net sales from the impact of covid-19.
non-gaap operating performance measures we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance.  these non-gaap financial measures exclude, as applicable, certain inventory and manufacturing-related charges including charges to discontinue certain product lines; intangible asset amortization; goodwill and intangible asset impairment; restructuring and other cost reduction initiative expenses; quality remediation expenses; acquisition, integration and related expenses; certain litigation gains and charges; expenses to establish initial compliance with the eu mdr; other charges; any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items; the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 tax act"); the effect of switzerland tax reform; other certain tax adjustments; and, with respect to earnings per share information, provide for the effect of dilutive shares assuming net earnings in a period of a reported net loss.  we use these non-gaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business.  additionally, we believe these non-gaap measures provide meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating our performance.  we believe these measures offer the ability to make period-to-period comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported income but that do not impact the fundamentals of our operations.  the non-gaap measures enable the evaluation of operating results and trend

analysis by allowing a reader to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items that are excluded from the non-gaap measures.  in addition, adjusted diluted earnings per share is used as a performance metric in our incentive compensation programs.
the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our non-gaap adjusted net earnings and non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes (in millions, except per share amounts):

(1)   inventory and manufacturing-related charges in 2020 and 2019 were primarily related to excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines we intend to discontinue and other charges. the year ended december 31, 2019 also included a $20.8 million charge incurred to terminate a raw material supply agreement. the excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines are driven by overlapping product lines in our portfolio and we have plans to discontinue one of the product lines, or from decisions not to spend additional funds to keep certain products up-to-date on the latest quality standards or requirements, such as the eu mdr, and so we have decided to discontinue such products. in 2018, the charges primarily related to inventory step-up. inventory step-up expense represents the incremental expense of inventory sold

38
recognized at its fair value after business combination accounting is applied versus the expense that would have been recognized if sold at its cost to manufacture.

(2)   we exclude intangible asset amortization from our non-gaap financial measures because we internally assess our performance against our peers without this amortization. due to various levels of acquisitions among our peers, intangible asset amortization can vary significantly from company to company.

(3)   in 2020 we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $470.0 million and $142.0 million related to our emea and dental reporting units, respectively. in 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $975.9 million. the impairment was comprised of $401.2 million in our spine reporting unit, $567.0 million in our emea reporting unit and $7.7 million in an insignificant reporting unit. in 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $33.0 million, $70.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively, of intangible asset impairments from merger-related ipr&amp;d intangible assets.

(4)   in december 2019, our board of directors approved, and we initiated, a new global restructuring program with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities. restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives also include other cost reduction initiatives that have the goal of reducing costs across the organization.

(5)   we are addressing inspectional observations on form 483 and a warning letter issued by the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") following its previous inspections of our warsaw north campus facility, among other matters. this quality remediation has required us to devote significant financial resources and is for a discrete period of time. the majority of the expenses are related to consultants who are helping us to update previous documents and redesign certain processes.

(6)   we exclude certain acquisition, integration and related gains and expenses from our non-gaap results.

(7)   we are involved in routine patent litigation, product liability litigation, commercial litigation and other various litigation matters. we review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine if excluding the losses or gains will provide our investors with useful incremental information. litigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results. the litigation charges and gains excluded from our non-gaap financial measures in the periods presented relate to product liability matters where we have received numerous claims on specific products, patent litigation and commercial litigation related to a common matter in multiple jurisdictions. in regards to the product liability matters, due to the complexities involved and claims filed in multiple districts, the expenses associated with these matters are significant to our operating results. once the litigation matter has been excluded from our non-gaap financial measures in a particular period, any additional expenses or gains from changes in estimates are also excluded, even if they are not significant, to ensure consistency in our non-gaap financial measures from period-to-period.

(8)   in the first quarter of 2019, we settled a patent infringement lawsuit out of court, and the other party agreed to pay us an upfront, lump-sum amount for a non-exclusive license to the patent.

(9)   the eu mdr imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements. the new regulations provide a transition period until may 2021 for currently-approved medical devices to meet the additional requirements. for certain devices, this transition period can be extended until may 2024. we are excluding from our non-gaap financial measures the incremental costs incurred to establish initial compliance with the regulations related to our currently-approved medical devices. the incremental costs primarily include third-party consulting necessary to supplement our internal resources.

(10)   we have incurred other various expenses from specific events or projects that we consider highly variable or that have a significant impact to our operating results that we have excluded from our non-gaap measures. these include costs related to legal entity, distribution and manufacturing optimization, including contract terminations, gains and losses from changes in fair value on our equity investments, as well as our costs of complying with our dpa with the u.s. government related to certain foreign corrupt practices act matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries. under the dpa, we were subject to oversight by an independent compliance monitor, which monitorship concluded in august 2020. on february 9, 2021, the one-count criminal information filed against us in 2017 was dismissed with prejudice and the dpa concluded. the excluded costs include the fees paid to the independent compliance monitor and to external legal counsel assisting in the matter.

(11)   represents the tax effects on the previously specified items. the tax effect for the u.s. jurisdiction is calculated based on an effective rate considering federal and state taxes, as well as permanent items. for jurisdictions outside the u.s., the tax effect is calculated based upon the statutory rates where the items were incurred.

(12)   the 2017 tax act resulted in a net favorable provisional adjustment due to the reduction of deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings and revaluation of deferred tax liabilities to a 21 percent rate, which was partially offset by provisional tax charges related to the toll charge provision of the 2017 tax act. in 2018, we finalized our estimates of the effects of the 2017 tax act based upon final guidance issued by u.s. tax authorities.

39
(13)   we recognized a tax benefit related to traf in addition to an impact from certain restructuring transactions in switzerland. also included are tax adjustments relating to the ongoing impacts of tax only amortization resulting from traf as well as certain restructuring transactions in switzerland.

(1)   other certain tax adjustments relate to various discrete tax period adjustments. in 2020, the adjustments were primarily related to the resolution of or changes in estimates of significant uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements or favorable rulings. in 2019 and 2018, the adjustments were primarily related to changes in tax rates on deferred tax liabilities recorded on intangible assets recognized in acquisition-related accounting and adjustments from internal restructuring transactions that provide us access to offshore funds in a tax efficient manner.

(1)   due to the reported net loss for 2020 and 2018, the effect of dilutive shares assuming net earnings is shown as an adjustment. diluted share count used in adjusted diluted eps is (in millions):

year ended            year ended december 31, 2020     december 31, 2018

diluted shares                                        207.0                 203.5

adjusted diluted shares                               208.4                 205.0
liquidity and capital resources the covid-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resource needs, primarily driven by the reduction in net sales due to elective surgical procedure deferrals.  we have taken prudent measures in an effort to maintain an adequate financial profile and to have access to capital to fund the business during these unprecedented times.  these measures included reductions to discretionary spending such as travel, meetings and other project spend that can be delayed with limited long-term detriment to the business.  however, we continued to incur fixed expenses that resulted in lower operating cash flows in 2020 when compared to 2019.
as of december 31, 2020, we had $802.1 million in cash and cash equivalents.  in addition, we had $1.0 billion available to borrow under our revolving credit agreement entered into on september 18, 2020 (the "september 2020 credit agreement") that contains a $1.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility (the "september 2020 revolving facility") and matures on september 17, 2021, and $1.5 billion available under our five-year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility of $1.5 billion (the "2019 multicurrency revolving facility") under the revolving credit agreement we entered into on november 1, 2019 (the "2019 credit agreement") that will mature on november 1, 2024.  the terms of the 2019 multicurrency revolving facility and the september 2020 revolving facility (collectively, the "revolving facilities") are described further below and in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
based on the actions described above, we believe that cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and available borrowings under our revolving facilities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.  at this time, we do not anticipate needing to borrow against our revolving facilities to fund our operations.  however, due to the significant uncertainties of the covid-19 pandemic, it is possible our needs may change.  further, there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all.
sources of liquidity cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,204.5 million in 2020 compared to $1,585.8 million and $1,747.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.  the decline in cash flow from operating activities in 2020 from 2019 was primarily the result of covid-19 reducing our cash inflows due to lower net sales while we continued to pay many fixed operating costs.  additionally, in 2020 we terminated our accounts receivable purchase arrangements in the u.s. and japan which we estimate negatively impacted operating cash flows by approximately $300 million.  the 2019 period included a payment of approximately $168 million on a patent infringement lawsuit.
cash flows used in investing activities were $613.8 million in 2020 compared to $729.3 million and $416.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.  instrument and property, plant and equipment additions reflected ongoing investments in our product portfolio and optimization of our manufacturing and logistics network.  in order to preserve cash, we prioritized investments in 2020 which resulted in lower investments in property, plant and equipment, totaling $117.5 million when compared to $207.1 million in 2019.  as further discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we made various acquisitions in 2020 requiring initial cash outlays of $235.5 million, net of acquired cash.  in 2019, we paid $197.6 million to buy out certain licensing arrangements from third parties.

cash flows used in financing activities were $421.8 million in 2020.  in 2020, we issued senior notes and received $1,497.1 million in proceeds, which were used to pay our $1,500.0 million senior notes at maturity on april 1, 2020.  additionally, with cash flows generated from operations, in 2020 we prepaid $250.0 million of our floating rate senior notes that mature march 19, 2021.  further, the termination of certain accounts receivable purchase arrangements in 2020 resulted in $54.6 million of financing cash outflows to the purchasing financial institutions.  these outflows represent the amount of unremitted cash that we had collected on sold accounts receivable as of december 31, 2019 that was repaid in 2020.  cash flows used in financing activities were $779.9 million in 2019.  our primary use of available cash in 2019 was for debt repayment.  we received net proceeds of $549.2 million from the issuance of additional euro-denominated senior notes which we used to repay $500.0 million of senior notes that became due on november 30, 2019.  in january 2019, we borrowed an additional $200.0 million under a u.s. term loan ("u.s. term loan c") and used those proceeds, along with cash on hand, to repay the remaining $225.0 million outstanding under the u.s. term loan ("u.s. term loan b") provided for under our 2016 credit agreement.  during 2019 we also repaid the $735.0 million outstanding balance under u.s. term loan c, with the remainder of the proceeds from the euro-denominated senior notes issuance and cash from operations.  overall, we had approximately $710 million of net principal repayments on our senior notes and term loans in 2019.
at december 31, 2020, we had outstanding debt of $8,126.5 million, of which $500.0 million was classified as current debt.  as it relates to our current debt, following december 31, 2020, we prepaid the remaining $200.0 million principal amount outstanding on our floating rate senior notes due march 19, 2021.  the remaining current debt consists of our $300.0 million senior notes due november 30, 2021.  we believe we can satisfy this debt obligation with cash generated from our operations, by issuing new debt, and/or by borrowing on our revolving credit facilities.
for additional information on our debt, including types of debt, maturity dates, interest rates, debt covenants and available revolving credit facilities, see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity.  we invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.
as of december 31, 2020, $390.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the u.s.  of this amount, $90.8 million is denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk.  the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.  we intend to repatriate at least $5.5 billion of unremitted earnings in future years.
in february, june, september and december 2020, our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.24 per share.  we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.
in february 2016, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program effective march 1, 2016, with no expiration date.  as of december 31, 2020, all $1.0 billion remained authorized.
as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, in december 2019, our board of directors approved, and we initiated, the 2019 restructuring plan with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities.  the 2019 restructuring plan is expected to result in total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $350 million to $400 million, $145 million of which was incurred through december 31, 2020.  we expect to reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $200 million to $300 million by the end of 2023 as program benefits under the 2019 restructuring plan are realized.
as discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we completed the acquisitions of a&e medical corporation and relign corp. in 2020.  these acquisitions included guaranteed deferred payments totaling $145.0 million that we are obligated to make in 2021.
as discussed in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements, the irs has issued proposed adjustments for years 2010 through 2012, as well as proposed adjustments for years 2013 through 2015, reallocating profits between certain of our u.s. and foreign subsidiaries.  we have disputed these proposed adjustments and intend to continue to vigorously defend our positions.  although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows.
as discussed in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various litigation matters with respect to which we expect to continue paying settlements over the next few years.

contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments.  the following table illustrates our contractual obligations and certain other commitments (in millions):
2022                 2024                  2026

and                  and                   and contractual obligations                  total   2021                            2023                 2025            thereafter long-term debt                        $8,171.6             500.0              1,981.4              2,000.0               3,690.2

toll charge tax liability                279.2                 -                 56.7                136.6                  85.9
other long-term liabilities              310.7                 -                223.3                 22.4                  65.0

$124.4 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2020 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans.  defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions.  due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2021.  therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans.  see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.
under the 2017 tax act, we have a $279.2 million liability remaining from a one-time tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits ("toll charge") for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. this amount was recorded in non-current income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2020.  we have elected to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years.
also included in long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon.  due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made.  therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits.  see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r&d milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, maintenance of exclusive rights to distribute a product.  since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table.  these estimated payments could range from $0 to $380 million.
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods.  significant accounting policies which require management's judgment are discussed below.
42
excess inventory and instruments - we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost.  similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply.  accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value.  to determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components.  the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work‐in‐process inventory, which is recorded at cost.  obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off.  management evaluates the need for changes to the net realizable values of inventory and instruments based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis.
income taxes - our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid.  we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction.  realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits.  we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is "more likely than not" that the deferred tax benefit will be realized.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations.  we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.  these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
commitments and contingencies - we are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of doing business, including litigation related to product, labor and intellectual property.  we establish liabilities for loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported.
goodwill and intangible assets - we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets and risk-adjusted discount rates.  as such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs.  changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.
in our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2020, all our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 percent.  fair value was determined using income and market approaches.  fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting units.  significant assumptions are incorporated into the income approach, such as estimated growth rates and risk-adjusted discount rates.  fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our reporting units.
future impairment in our reporting units could occur if the estimates used in the income and market approaches change.  if our estimates of profitability in the reporting unit decline, the fair value estimate under the income approach will decline.  additionally, changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates and comparable company valuation indicators, which may impact our estimated fair values.
43
further, changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase the cost of procuring inventory and services from foreign suppliers, which could reduce reporting unit profitability.

item 1a - risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.

covid-19 risks covid-19 significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and global trade and may continue to have a disruptive effect on our operations, and the operations of our service providers and our customers, which may further impact our business.
covid-19 was declared as a global health emergency and later declared as a global pandemic by the world health organization. as a result, throughout 2020 governments have implemented travel restrictions, mandated lockdowns and other precautionary measures that resulted in significant business and supply chain disruptions and a slowdown in international trade. this crisis has affected, and is expected to continue affecting, our business in many aspects. governments have designated our operations as essential business and we activated our business continuity plan to be able to conduct operations. our facilities and employees are operating under the constraints of special protective measures and many are working remotely. these disruptions are also threatening the financial stability of our service providers and the ability to efficiently and profitably route our customers' freight. reduced flight schedules and cancellations have significantly reduced available space for airfreight, while ocean carriers have continued to manage their operating capacity. certain freight lanes have presented severe shortages of capacity compared to demand at various times over the year while ocean ports congestion in the second half of the year also hampered the routing of freight. these freight market conditions have created and continue to create pricing volatility that challenges expeditors' ability to maintain historical unitary profitability. many of our customers are experiencing disruptions in their revenue and cash flow, prompting these customers to renegotiate contractual terms and increasing our accounts receivable collection risks. such conditions could result in the loss of business and additional bad debt allowances in the future if our customers' ability to pay deteriorates. although we are monitoring the situation, we cannot predict for how long, or the ultimate extent to which the pandemic and related precautionary measures may disrupt our operations. any significant disruption resulting from this on a large scale or over an extended period of time would negatively affect our business and our financial results. the covid-19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.
we rely on service providers, such as air, ocean and ground freight carriers, and if they become financially unstable or have reduced capacity to provide service because of covid-19, it may adversely impact our business and operating results.
as a non-asset based provider of global logistics services, expeditors depends on a variety of asset-based service providers, including air, ocean and ground freight carriers. the quality and profitability of our services depend upon effective selection and oversight of our service providers. covid-19 places significant stress on our air, ocean and freight ground carriers, which may continue to result in reduced carrier capacity or availability, pricing volatility or more limited carrier transportation schedules which could adversely impact our operations and financial results. during the pandemic, air carriers have been particularly affected having to cancel flights due to travel restrictions resulting in dramatic drops in revenues, historical losses and liquidity challenges. uncertainty over recovery of demand for passenger air travel, in particular business travel, to pre-pandemic levels means air carriers' operations and financial stability may be adversely affected long term. prior to 2020, ocean carriers have incurred significant operating losses are still highly leveraged with debt. additionally, several ocean carriers have consolidated, with the potential for more to occur in the future.
the global economic recession has impacted trade and could affect demand for our services or the financial stability of our service providers and customers.
the global economy has entered a recession as a result of the pandemic, which has affected trade and could affect demand for our services. continued unfavorable economic conditions could result in lower freight volumes and adversely affect expeditors' revenues, operating results and cash flows. these conditions should they continue for extended period of time would further adversely affect our customers and service providers. should our customers' ability to pay deteriorate, additional bad debts may be incurred.
industry risks any reduction in international commerce or disruption in global trade may adversely impact our business and operating results.
expeditors primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce. everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract our primary market and adversely impact our operating results. for example, international trade is influenced by:
•   currency exchange rates and currency control regulations;

•   interest rate fluctuations;

•   changes and uncertainties in governmental policies and inter-governmental disputes, which could result in increased tariff rates, quota restrictions, trade barriers and other types of restrictions;

•   changes in and application of international and domestic customs, trade and security regulations;

•   wars, strikes, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts;

•   changes in labor and other costs;

•   increased global concerns regarding working conditions and environmental sustainability;

•   changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own;

•   changes in availability of credit; and

•   changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleum-related products.

16.
our industry is highly competitive, and failure to compete or respond to customer requirements could damage our business and results of operations.
the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited. nevertheless, many of these competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors, and are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities and are developing new technologies to gain competitive advantages. depending on the location of the shipper and the importer, we must compete against both the niche players, larger entities including carriers, and emerging technology companies. the primary competitive factors are price and quality of service. many larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers. customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service and to secure favorable pricing and contractual terms such as longer payment terms, fixed-price arrangements, higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties. increased competition and competitors' acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues, reduced margins, higher operating costs or loss of market share, any of which would damage our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
operational risks we are dependent on our personnel and any inability to develop or retain our key employees may have a negative impact on our operations.
identifying, training and retaining employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability. effective succession planning is an important element of our programs. failure to ensure an effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business by hindering our ability to execute our business strategies and impacting our level of service. we must continue to develop and retain management personnel to address issues of succession planning.
we believe that our compensation programs, which have been in place since we became a publicly traded entity, are among the unique characteristics responsible for differentiating our performance from that of many of our competitors. significant changes to compensation programs or significant declines in our operating income or operating losses could impact our ability to attract and retain key personnel.
the global pandemic has caused disruptions to our work environment by requiring the majority of employees to work remotely. we cannot predict how this may affect employees' habits, preferences nor the impact it may have on our company's culture and our ability to continue to retain and attract talented employees who have become accustomed to a remote work environment.
we rely heavily upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies used in our core business and failure to properly manage such technologies could lead to disruptions in our operations or our ability to remain competitive.
expeditors relies heavily and must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing our core businesses. future results depend on our success in developing competitive and reliable systems to address the needs of our customers and suppliers. development and maintenance of these systems must be accomplished in a cost-effective manner and support the use of secure protocols, including integration and availability of third party technology. we are continually enhancing our systems, including significant upgrades to core operating and accounting systems. these efforts are inherently complex and if not managed properly could lead to disruptions in our operations or our ability to remain competitive.
any significant disruptions to our network and systems continuity could have an adverse impact to our business and financial results.
as expeditors, our customers and suppliers continue to increase reliance on systems, and as additional features are added, the risks also increase. any significant disruptions to our global systems or the internet for any reason, which could include equipment or network failures; co-location facility failures; power outages; sabotage; employee error or other actions; cyber-attacks or other security breaches; reliance on third party technology; geo-political activity or natural disasters; all of which could have a material negative effect on our results. this could include loss of revenue; business disruptions (such as the inability to timely process shipments); loss of property, including trade secrets and confidential information; legal claims and proceedings; reporting delays or errors; interference with regulatory reporting; significant remediation costs; an increase in costs to protect our systems and technology; or damage to our reputation.
we rely on our service providers, such as air, ocean and ground freight carriers, and as they are experiencing increases in operating costs it may impact our profitability.
expeditors' carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws, which could, directly or indirectly, have a material adverse effect on our business. future regulatory developments in the u.s. and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the transportation industry, which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs. if we are unable to pass such costs on to our customers, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
changes in the financial stability, operating capabilities and capacity of asset-based carriers and capacity allotment made available to expeditors by asset-based carriers affects us in unpredictable ways. any combination of reduced carrier capacity or availability, pricing volatility
17.
or more limited carrier transportation schedules, such as those caused by the pandemic, could further negatively affect our ability to execute services and maintain profitability. expeditors cannot predict whether relief measures extended by certain governments will be effective in supporting the financial viability of carriers nor can we predict the long-term effects of this crisis on carriers' financial stability and ability to provide services.
failure to grow and gain profitable market share could adversely impact our ability to remain competitive and could adversely impact our business.
expeditors has historically relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition. future results will depend upon our ability to anticipate and adapt to constantly evolving supply chain requirements and innovations. to continue to grow organically, we must gain profitable market share in a highly competitive environment and successfully develop and market new service offerings. when investment opportunities arise, our success could be dependent on our ability to evaluate and integrate acquisitions.
any disruption of our business caused by a catastrophic event, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and impact our operating results.
a disruption or failure of expeditors' systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, strike, civil unrest, mass population dislocations, pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other mission-critical functions. our corporate headquarters and certain other critical business operations are in the seattle, washington area, which is near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results.
difficulty in forecasting timing or volumes of customer shipments or rate changes by carriers could adversely impact our margins and operating results.
expeditors is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting short-term customer requirements. however, long-term customer satisfaction depends upon our ability to meet these unpredictable short-term customer requirements. personnel costs, our single largest expense, are always less flexible in the very near term as we must staff to meet uncertain demand. as a result, short-term operating results could be disproportionately affected.
a significant portion of expeditors' revenues is derived from customers in retail and technology industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just-in-time production schedules. therefore, the timing of our revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of our control, such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods, changes in trade tariffs, product launches and/or manufacturing production delays. additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, we may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts or investors, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of our stock.
volatile market conditions can create situations where rate increases charged by carriers and other service providers are implemented with little or no advance notice. we often cannot pass these rate increases on to our customers in the same time frame, if at all. as a result, our yields and margins can be negatively impacted, as recently experienced.
government regulation and tax risks we are subject to a complex regulatory environment, and failure to comply with and adapt to these regulations could result in penalties or otherwise adversely impact our business.
expeditors is affected by ever increasing regulations from a number of sources in the united states and in foreign locations in which we operate. many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation, including those related to handling dangerous and hazardous materials, trade compliance, data privacy, environmental, employment, compensation and competition, and may result in unforeseen costs.
in reaction to the continuing global terrorist threat, governments around the world are continuously enacting or updating security regulations. these regulations are multi-layered, increasingly technical in nature and characterized by a lack of harmonization of substantive requirements among various governmental authorities. furthermore, the implementation of these regulations, including deadlines and substantive requirements, can be driven by regulatory urgencies rather than industry's realistic ability to comply.
failure to consistently and timely comply with these regulations, or the failure, breach or compromise of our policies and procedures or those of our service providers or agents, may result in increased operating costs, damage to our reputation, difficulty in attracting and retaining key personnel, restrictions on operations or fines and penalties.
18.
in 2020, the united kingdom and the european union negotiated the terms of the united kingdom's exit from the european union (eu), which were effective on january 1, 2021. these rules and regulations are in the process of being implemented and are subject to further interpretation and change. the full impact of the united kingdom's departure, and impact to international trade is still uncertain.
we operate globally and any inability to safeguard our operations or comply with anti-corruption laws would adversely impact our reputation and business.
the majority of expeditors' revenues and operating income comes from operations conducted outside the united states. to maintain a global service network, we may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations. doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises.
in addition, we operate in parts of the world where common business practices could constitute violations of the anti-corruption laws, rules, regulations and decrees of the united states and of other countries in which we conduct business, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act; as well as trade and exchange control laws, or laws, regulations and executive orders imposing embargoes and sanctions; and anti-boycott laws and regulations. compliance with these laws, rules, regulations and decrees is dependent on our employees, service providers, agents, third party brokers and customers, whose individual actions could violate these laws, rules, regulations and decrees. failure to comply could result in substantial penalties and additional expenses, damage to our reputation and restrictions on our ability to conduct business.
we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions, and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse determinations in tax audits could negatively impact our financial results.
expeditors is subject to taxation in the united states (federal, state and local) as well as many foreign jurisdictions including the people's republic of china, including hong kong, taiwan, vietnam, india, mexico, canada, netherlands and the united kingdom. in many of these jurisdictions, the tax laws are very complex and are open to different interpretations and application. tax authorities frequently implement new taxes and change their tax rates and rules, including interpretations of those rules. the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations can be highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts recorded.
it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will undergo further audits and examinations by various tax authorities and possibly may reach resolution related to income tax examinations covering one or more jurisdictions and years. in december 2017, the united states made significant changes to its tax laws, still subject to issuance of new regulations and interpretation, which added complexity and uncertainty in calculating corporate tax liabilities. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities, including transfer pricing inquiries. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits, including any potential penalties and interest, could be materially different from our tax provisions and accruals and negatively impact our financial results.
current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. changes in tax laws or statutory tax rates, competing tax regimes, variability in the mix of pretax earnings we generate in the u.s, as compared to other countries, or new taxes in the united states or foreign jurisdictions could result in additional tax liabilities, or increased volatility in our effective tax rate.
general risks investigations and litigation could require management time and or incur substantial legal costs or fines, penalties or damages, any of which could materially adverse impact on our financial results.
as a multinational corporation, expeditors is subject to formal or informal investigations from governmental authorities or others in the countries in which we do business. in addition, we may become subject to civil litigation with our customers, service providers and other parties with whom we do business. these investigations and litigation may require significant management time and could cause us to incur substantial additional legal and related costs, which may include fines, penalties or damages that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results.
item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview expeditors international of washington, inc. provides a full suite of global logistics services. our services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding, customs brokerage, warehousing and distribution, purchase order management, vendor consolidation, time-definite transportation services, temperature-controlled transit, cargo insurance, specialized cargo monitoring and tracking, and other supply chain solutions. we do not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business. as a non-asset based carrier, we do not own or operate transportation assets.
the covid-19 pandemic has significantly affected our business operations for the year ended december 31, 2020, and we expect these disruptive conditions to continue into 2021. the significant impacts are discussed under item 1 business section and below within results of operations.
we derive our revenues by entering into agreements that are generally comprised of a single performance obligation, which is that freight is shipped for and received by our customer. each performance obligation is comprised of one or more of the company's services. we typically satisfy our performance obligations as services are rendered over time. a typical shipment would include services rendered at origin, such as pick-up and delivery to port, freight services from origin to destination port and destination services, such as customs clearance and final delivery. our three principal services are the revenue categories presented in our financial statements: 1) airfreight services, 2) ocean freight and ocean services, and 3) customs brokerage and other services. the most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume, sell rates and buy rates. volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of our three primary sources of revenue.
we generate the major portion of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct (asset-based) carriers and then reselling those services to our customers on a retail basis. the rate billed to our customers (the sell rate) is recognized as revenues and the rate we pay to the carrier (the buy rate) is recognized in operating expenses as the directly related cost of transportation and other expenses. by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating our buying power, we are able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers, while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves.
in most cases we act as an indirect carrier. when acting as an indirect carrier, we issue a house airway bill (hawb), a house ocean bill of lading (hobl) or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage. in turn, when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier, we receive a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments.
customs brokerage and other services involve providing services at destination, such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties  and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and import services such as arranging for delivery. these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which we have offices. we also provide other value added services at destination, such as warehousing and distribution, time-definitive transportation services and consulting.
in these transactions, we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue. generally, revenue is recorded on a gross basis when we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the services, when we assume risk of loss, when we have discretion in setting the prices for the services to the customers, and we have the ability to direct the use of the services provided by the third party. when revenue is recorded on a net basis, the amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee, a per unit of activity fee or a combination thereof. for revenues earned in other capacities, for instance, when we do not issue a hawb, a hobl, or a house seaway bill or otherwise act solely as an agent for the shipper, only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues. in these transactions, we are not a principal and report only commissions and fees earned in revenue.
24.
we manage our company along five geographic areas of responsibility: americas; north asia; south asia; europe; and middle east, africa and india (mair). each area is divided into sub-regions that are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility. our business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area. the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units. because of this inter-relationship between operating units, it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to our overall success on a stand-alone basis. the following chart shows revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
our operating units share revenue using the same arms-length pricing methodologies that we use when our offices transact business with independent agents. certain costs are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying services, which can include allocation based on actual costs incurred or estimated cost plus a profit margin. our strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability, which includes shared revenues and allocated costs. therefore, individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within our network.
the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each of our regions. in accordance with our revenue recognition policy (see note 1.f to the consolidated financial statements in this report), almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share of revenue at the destination.
north asia is our largest export oriented region and accounted for 38% of revenues, 44% of directly related cost of transportation and other expenses and 37% of operating income for the year ended december 31, 2020. north asia's directly related cost of transportation and other expenses are higher than other segments due to the largely export nature of the operations in that region. the people's republic of china, including hong kong, represented more than 84% of north asia revenues, 85% of directly related cost of transportation and other expenses and 79% operating income for the year ended december 31, 2020.
25.
expeditors' culture we believe that our unique culture, at the center of which are our employees, is a critical component to our continued success. we strongly believe that it is nearly impossible to predict events that, individually or in the aggregate, could have a positive or a negative impact on our future operations. as a result, management's focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where well-trained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help us adapt and thrive as major trends emerge. global consistency and compliance is fundamental to preserving our culture and network of people, processes, technology and locations our business growth strategy emphasizes a focus on the right markets and, within each market, on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth through the aggressive marketing of our service offerings. innovative solutions, integrated platforms and data quality are vital to achieving a competitive advantage. expeditors' teams are aligned on the specific markets; on the targeted accounts within those markets; and on ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.
our ability to provide services to customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines, ocean carriers, ground transportation providers and governmental agencies. the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism, security, changes in governmental regulation and oversight of international trade. a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles, especially as governments promulgate new regulations in reaction to the pandemic and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws. we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory.
our business is also highly dependent on the financial stability and operational capabilities of the carriers we utilize. carriers are highly leveraged with debt and many are incurring, or have recently incurred, operating losses. as a result, carriers are facing significant liquidity challenges exacerbated by the pandemic and are seeking relief under various government support programs. this environment requires that we be selective in determining which carriers to utilize. further changes in the financial stability, operating capabilities and capacity of asset-based carriers, capacity allotments available from carriers, governmental regulations, and/or trade accords could adversely affect our business in unpredictable ways.
as a knowledge-based global provider of logistics services, we have often concluded over the course of our history that it is better to grow organically rather than by acquisition. however, when we have made acquisitions, it has generally been to obtain technology, geographic coverage or specialized industry expertise that could be leveraged to benefit our entire network. in may 2020, we acquired a less-than-truckload digital online shipping platform which aligns with our focus on enhancing our digital solutions.
international trade and competition we operate in over 60 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and our activities are closely tied to the global economy. the global economy entered into a recession as a result of the pandemic and related precautionary measures including government lockdowns, shutdown of manufacturing and operations for non-essential businesses and travel restrictions. international trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad, currency exchange rates, laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation. periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to tariffs and trade restrictions and accords. currently, the united states and china have significantly increased tariffs on certain imports and are engaged in trade negotiations and changes to export regulations and tariffs. we cannot predict the outcome of changes in tariffs, or interpretations, and trade restrictions and accords and the effects they will have on our business. as governments implement higher tariffs on imports, manufacturers may accelerate, to the extent possible, shipments to avoid higher tariffs and, over time, may shift manufacturing to other countries. doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. in addition to being influenced by governmental policies and inter-governmental disputes concerning international trade, our business may also be negatively affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the united states and other countries, as well as economic turbulence, political unrest and security concerns in the nations and on the trade shipping lanes in which we conduct business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade, oil prices and security costs.
in 2020, the united kingdom and the european union negotiated the terms of the united kingdom's exit from the european union (eu), which were effective on january 1, 2021. these rules and regulations are in the process of being implemented and are subject to further interpretation and change. the full impact of the united kingdom's departure, and impact to international trade is still uncertain.
the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. our pricing and terms continue to be pressured by uncertainty in global trade and economic conditions, concerns over availability of airfreight and ocean freight
26.
capacity, volatile carrier pricing, disruptions in port services, political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates. we expect these operating and competitive conditions to continue.
air carriers are experiencing significant cash flow challenges as a result of travel restrictions resulting in cancellation of flights and have incurred record operating losses in 2020. uncertainty over recovery of demand for passenger air travel, in particular business travel, compared to pre-pandemic levels may impact air carriers' operations and financial stability long term. prior to 2020, many ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses and are highly leveraged with debt. these conditions have resulted in multiple carrier acquisitions and carrier alliance formations. carriers also face new regulatory requirements that became effective in 2020 requiring reductions in the sulfur in marine fuel, which are increasing their operating and capital costs. when the market experiences seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption, the carriers often increase their pricing suddenly. this carrier behavior creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors' ability to maintain historical unitary profitability.
there is uncertainty as to how new regulatory requirements and volatility in oil prices will continue to impact future buy rates. because fuel is an integral part of carriers' costs and impacts both our buy rates and sell rates, we would expect our revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the effect of changing fuel prices. to the extent that future fuel prices increases and we are unable to pass through the increases to our customers, this could adversely affect our operating income.
the global economic and trade environments remain uncertain, including the ongoing impacts of the pandemic. we cannot predict the impact of future changes in global trade on our operating results, freight volumes, pricing, changes in consumer demand, carrier stability and capacity, customers' abilities to pay or on changes in competitors' behavior. additionally, we cannot predict the direct or indirect impact that further changes in consumer purchasing behavior, such as online shopping, could have on our business. in response to governments implementing higher tariffs on imports, as well as responses to the pandemic's disruptions, some customers have begun shifting manufacturing to other countries which could negatively impact us.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s. gaap). preparing our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report.
management believes that the nature of our business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations. while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting, the use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas:
•   accrual of loss contingencies;

•   accrual of various tax liabilities and contingencies;

•   accounts receivable valuation; and

•   accrual of insurance liabilities for the portion of the related exposure that we have self-insured.

these estimates, other than the accrual of loss contingencies and tax liabilities and contingencies, are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change. management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are non-aggressive in approach and consistent in application. management believes that there are limited, if any, alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to these transactions. while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates, management believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported.
the outcome of loss contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims and government investigations, brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a contingency, such as a legal proceeding, claim or government investigation, is recorded by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a loss contingency is made if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be recorded, management evaluates several factors, including advice from outside legal counsel, in order to estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss. changes in these factors could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year.
accounting for income taxes involves significant estimates and judgments. we are subject to taxation in various states and in many foreign jurisdictions including the people's republic of china, including hong kong, taiwan, vietnam, india, mexico, canada, netherlands and the united kingdom. management believes that our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are reasonable and that they are
27.
consistently applied. we are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter. sometimes audits and examinations result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in significant additional tax, penalties and interest payments being required. we establish liabilities when, despite our belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law, we conclude that we may not be successful in realizing the tax position. in evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position and in consultation with qualified tax advisors.
the total amount of our tax contingencies may increase in 2021. in addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws and changes in interpretations of these laws may increase our existing tax contingencies. the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations can be highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ significantly from the amounts recorded. it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we may undergo further audits and examinations by various tax authorities and it is also possible that we may reach resolution related to income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. these assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in future years and may increase the amount of tax expense we recognize as well as the potential for penalties and interest being incurred. our estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on our experience, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by the taxing jurisdiction. though we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support the evaluation of our tax positions are reasonable, the actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of its resolution.
as discussed in note 1.g to the consolidated financial statements, earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for impacts associated with u.s. tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act (2017 tax act). the 2017 tax act, which is also commonly referred to as "u.s. tax reform," significantly changed u.s. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21% starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously undistributed foreign earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries.
our effective tax rate will largely depend on the mix of pretax earnings that we generate in the u.s. as compared to the rest of the world and the impact of any discrete items for events occurring in the period or future changes in tax regulations and related interpretations.

2020 compared with 2019
airfreight services:
in the second quarter and continuing through the remainder of 2020, airfreight services experienced unprecedented events in response to the global pandemic. as a result of travel restrictions and lower passenger demand, airlines significantly reduced flight schedules which limited available belly space for cargo at a time where global demand for time-sensitive delivery of essential ppe, medical supplies and technology equipment remained high. demand grew in the fourth quarter and a concentration of flights to key gateway hubs caused congestion at airports that put further constraints on available capacity. these conditions have caused extreme imbalances between carrier capacity and demand, principally on exports out of north asia. in order to execute and meet the transportation needs of our customers we heavily utilized charter flights and purchased capacity in advance and on the spot market, which resulted in historically high average buy and sell rates.
airfreight services revenues increased 63% in 2020, as compared with 2019, primarily due to a 78% increase in average sell rates partially offset by a 3% decrease in tonnage. sell rates increased to unprecedented levels in all regions with the largest impacts in north asia and south asia. tonnage through most of the year was affected by the decline in international trade as a result of the pandemic. tonnage declined in all regions except north asia. north asia airfreight services revenue represented 24% and 14% of the total company consolidated revenues for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
airfreight services expenses increased 72% in 2020, as compared with 2019, primarily due to an 81% increase in average buy rates partially offset by a 3% decrease in tonnage. buy rates increased in all regions with the largest impacts in north asia and south asia.
during the fourth quarter of 2020, we experienced record high tonnage and continued high average sell rates and buy rates. when compared to the third quarter of 2020, demand for airfreight grew while capacity shortages persisted in particular on exports from north asia. airfreight services revenues and expenses increased 41% and 47%, respectively, from the third quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2020, principally
30.
due to 20% and 24% increase in average sell rates and buy rates and a 20% increase in tonnage. compared the fourth quarter 2019, airfreight services revenues and expenses increased 104% and 116%, respectively, principally due to 99% and 104% increase in average sell rates and buy rates and a 10% increase in tonnage. airfreight services revenues and expenses represented 49% and 52% of our total revenues and expenses, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2020.
the annual decrease in airfreight tonnage was primarily due to the global pandemic. as a result of the pandemic, governments around the world implemented travel restrictions and suspended non-essential services. this caused supply chain disruptions for our domestic and international customers, which correspondingly decreased our airfreight volumes. in 2020, south asia, north america and europe had decreases in tonnage of 22%, 5% and 8%, respectively, when compared to 2019. north asia had an increase in tonnage of 13% in 2020, as compared with 2019.
these conditions create a high degree of volatility in volumes, buy rates and sell rates and are expected to continue into 2021 as international passenger flights are not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels and additional capacity from freighters is limited. the historically high buy and sell rates have significantly contributed to the growth in our expenses and revenues and financial results in 2020. these unprecedented operating conditions are not expected to be sustained long-term. we are unable to predict how these uncertainties and any future disruptions, such as continued urgent distribution of covid-19 vaccines, will affect our future operations or financial results.
ocean freight and ocean services:
ocean freight consolidation, direct ocean forwarding and order management are the three basic services that constitute and are collectively referred to as ocean freight and ocean services. ocean freight and ocean services revenues and expenses increased 6% and 9%, respectively, in 2020, as compared with 2019. the largest component of our ocean freight and ocean services revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation, which represented 66% and 65% of ocean freight and ocean services revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
ocean freight consolidation revenues and expenses increased 8% and 10%, respectively in 2020, as compared with 2019 primarily due to a 13% increase in sell rates and a 15% increase in buy rates, partially offset by a 3% decrease in containers shipped. ocean freight volumes and pricing were impacted by the effect of the pandemic in 2020. starting in the first quarter of 2020 there was a sharp decrease in international trade and low demand, primarily from disruptions in manufacturing and store closures. during that period ocean carriers managed their capacity to market demand resulting in increases in buy rates. demand increased in the second half of the year and soared in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to backlogs in supply chains and low inventory levels, creating a severe imbalance between demand and capacity in particular on exports from north asia and south asia. the deficiency in available capacity was further exacerbated by congestion at ports due to labor and equipment shortages, which disrupted sailing schedules, and resulted in higher average buy rates. sell rates and volumes increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 as we were able to timely adjust to market conditions and leverage our capacity agreements with ocean carriers.
direct ocean freight forwarding revenues and expenses increased 6% and 11% in 2020, as compared with 2019, primarily due to higher volumes, changes in customer mix and higher costs as a result of congestion at the ports, primarily in north america. order management revenues and expenses decreased 2% and 1% in 2020, as compared with 2019, primarily due to lower volumes mostly from the retail industry.
north asia ocean freight and ocean services revenues and directly related expenses increased 7% and 9% in 2020, as compared with 2019, primarily due to higher average buy and sell rates, partially offset by a 1% decline in container volumes. south asia ocean freight and ocean services revenues and directly related expenses increased 20% and 22% in 2020, as compared with 2019, primarily due to higher average sell and buy rates and a 6% increase in containers shipped. in 2020, the largest decline in container volume was in exports from north america.
most ocean carriers experienced significant increase in market demand in the latter part of the year and we expect this demand to continue into 2021. until port congestion and equipment shortages subside, we believe there will be continued pressure on buy rates. we also expect that pricing volatility will continue as customers solicit bids, react to governmental trade policies, and adjust to the continued disruptions of the global economy from the pandemic, while carriers continue to adapt to changes in capacity and market demand and merge or create alliances with other carriers. carriers also face new regulatory requirements that became effective in 2020 to reduce the use of sulfur in marine fuel, which are increasing their operating and capital costs, which could result in higher costs for us. these conditions could result in lower operating income.
customs brokerage and other services:
customs brokerage and other services revenues and expenses each decreased 2% in 2020, as compared with 2019, primarily due to decreases in shipments from existing customers in the first three quarters of the year. slowdowns due to the pandemic related closures affected volumes, particularly in aerospace, automotive, oil and energy and certain portions of the retail sectors and the onboarding of new customers was negatively impacted. customers continue to value our brokerage services due to changing tariffs and increasing complexity in the declaration process. customers seek knowledgeable customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program that are necessary to rapidly respond to changes in the regulatory and security environment.
31.
north america revenues and directly related expenses decreased % and %, respectively in 2020, as compared with 2019, primarily as a result of lower volumes in customs brokerage.
overhead expenses:
salaries and related costs increased 8% in 2020, as compared with 2019, principally due to increases in commissions and bonuses earned from higher revenues and operating income.
historically, the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and operating income has been the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of our company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee. using this compensation model, changes in individual incentive compensation occur in proportion to changes in our operating income, creating an alignment between branch and corporate performance and shareholder interests.
our management compensation programs have always been incentive-based and performance driven. bonuses to field management in 2020 were up 26% when compared to the same period in 2019. bonuses under the executive incentive compensation plan were up 17%, primarily due an increase in operating income offset by a reduction made to senior executive management bonus allocations, as well as unused bonus allocations available for future investments in the development of key personnel.
because our management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative, generally no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is, from inception, cumulatively profitable. any operating losses must be offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus. executive management, in limited circumstances, makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level. since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs, we believe that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by our managers. the outcome of any higher risk transactions, such as overriding established credit limits, would be known in a relatively short time frame. management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of the short operating cycle of our services, the potential for short-term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking. management believes that both the stability and the long-term growth in operating income and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in our compensation programs.
other overhead expenses remained constant in 2020, as compared with 2019. there was a significant decrease in travel and entertainment expense due to travel restrictions, that was offset primarily by increases in bad debt, claims and contingencies, indirect taxes and depreciation expense. we will continue to make important investments in people, processes and technology, as well as to invest in our strategic efforts to explore new areas for profitable growth.
income tax expense:
our consolidated effective income tax rate was 27.0% in 2020, as compared to 25.6% in 2019. the effect of higher average tax rates of our international subsidiaries, when compared to u.s. federal and state tax rates, were partially offset by u.s. foreign tax credits and u.s. income tax deductions for foreign-derived intangible income (fdii). in 2020 when compared to 2019, the earnings of our international subsidiaries were proportionally higher than that of our u.s. subsidiaries. in  2020 and 2019, we benefited from u.s. federal tax credits totaling $16.7 million and $15.7 million, respectively principally because of withholding taxes related to our foreign operations, as well as u.s. income tax deductions for fdii of $10 million and $9 million, respectively. in 2020, when compared to 2019, we benefited from increased tax deductions for share-based compensation, principally stock option exercises of our employees. these amounts were partially offset by the effect of higher foreign tax rates of our international subsidiaries, when compared to the u.s. federal income tax rate of 21%, as well as certain expenses that are no longer deductible under the 2017 tax act, including certain executive compensation in excess of amounts allowed. in 2019, we benefited from state income tax refunds totaling approximately $4 million.
some elements of the recorded impacts of the 2017 tax act could be impacted by further legislative action as well as additional interpretations and guidance issued by the irs or treasury. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the tax benefit associated with non-qualified stock option and restricted stock unit grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recorded (excess tax benefits are recorded upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options and vesting of rsus and psus) while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans shares cannot be anticipated and are therefore recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs. our effective tax rate is subject to variation and the effective tax rate may be more or less volatile based on the amounts of pre-tax income or loss. for example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on the effective rate is greater when pre-tax income is lower. total consolidated foreign income tax expense is composed of the income tax expense of our non-u.s. subsidiaries as well as income based withholding taxes paid by our non-u.s. subsidiaries on behalf of its parent for intercompany payments, including the remittance of dividends.
32.
currency and other risk factors the nature of our worldwide operations necessitates dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this results in our being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference. some of the countries where we maintain offices and/or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations, which influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices and agents. we may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on our ability to move money freely around the world or the short-term financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most time-sensitive way to mitigate short-term exchange losses. any such hedging activity during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was insignificant. we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31, 2020 and 2019. net foreign currency losses were approximately $25 million, $9 million and $2 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensely competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry, including new technology-based competitors entering the industry, many of which have significantly more resources than us; however, our primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group. expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities. the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multi-service networks. however, regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive force.
the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of operations. we emphasize quality customer service and believe that our prices are competitive with those of others in the industry. customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service, pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms, higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties. increased competition and competitors' acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues, reduced margins, higher operating costs, higher claims or loss of market share, any of which would damage our results of operations and financial condition.
larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as just-in-time inventory management. we believe that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage. accordingly, sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers. developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers. smaller and middle-tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network.
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2020 was $655 million, as compared with $772 million for 2019. this $117 million decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital, principally from excess customer billings over collections when compared to the same period in 2019 as a result of growth in activity and high sell rates in the fourth quarter of 2020, offset by increased earnings. at december 31, 2020, working capital was $2,071 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $1,528 million. we had no long-term debt at december 31, 2020. management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations.
as a customs broker, we make significant cash advances for a select group of our credit-worthy customers. these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties and taxes to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world. increases in duty rates could result in increases in the amounts we advance on behalf of our customers. cash advances are a "pass through" and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense. the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities. as a result of these "pass through" billings, the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency. for customers that meet certain criteria, we have agreed to extend payment terms beyond our customary terms. our accounts receivable and consequently our customer credit exposure has also increased as a result of historically high freight rates. management believes that it has established effective credit control procedures, and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems.
our business historically has been subject to seasonal fluctuations and this is expected to continue in the future. cash flows fluctuate as a result of this seasonality. historically, the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings. this results in positive cash flow. the increased activity associated with periods of higher demand (typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter) causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections. this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash.
33.
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020 was $46 million, which is consistent with 2019. we had capital expenditures of $48 million in 2020 and $47 million 2019. capital expenditures in 2020 related primarily to our purchase of a less-than-truckload digital online shipping platform, continuing investments in building and leasehold improvements and technology and facilities equipment. occasionally, we elect to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers' freight. total anticipated capital expenditures in 2021 are currently estimated to be $45 million. this includes routine capital expenditures and investments in technology.
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020 was $332 million as compared with $418 million in 2019. we used the proceeds from stock option exercises, employee stock purchases and available cash to repurchase our common stock on the open market to reduce issued and outstanding shares. during 2020 and 2019, we used cash to repurchase 4.6 million and 5.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, to reduce the number of total outstanding shares. during 2020 and 2019, we paid dividends of $1.04 and $1.00 per share, respectively.
we have a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase shares to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 160 million shares of common stock. during 2020 we repurchased 4.6 million shares at an average price of $72.26 per share. we had a non-discretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises. as of march 31, 2019, all shares authorized under this plan have been repurchased. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for cumulative repurchases under both repurchase plans.
we follow established guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. historically, our investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by disruptions occurring in the credit markets. however, there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected in the future.
we cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy, and political uncertainty nor the covid-19 pandemic may continue to have on our operating results, freight volumes, pricing, amounts advanced on behalf of our customers, changes in consumer demand, carrier stability and capacity, customers' abilities to pay or on changes in competitors' behavior.
at december 31, 2020, we were contingently liable for $72 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees. the standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of our foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers, primarily airlines, and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and value-added-tax (vat) taxation. the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the accounting records of the respective foreign subsidiaries, and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform.

we typically enter into short-term unconditional purchase obligations with asset-based providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis. the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions. we only enter into agreements that management believes we can fulfill. in the regular course of business, we also enter into agreements with service providers to maintain or operate equipment, facilities or software that can be longer than one year. we also regularly have contractual obligations for specific projects related to improvements of our owned or leased facilities and information technology infrastructure.

our foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the u.s. parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and funds necessary to finance local capital expenditures. in some cases, our ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls. at december 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalent balances of $620 million were held by our non-united states subsidiaries, of which $27 million was held in banks in the united states. earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states.
impact of inflation to date, our business has not been adversely affected by inflation. however significant direct carrier rate increases occurred in 2020, as a result of the disruptions caused by the pandemic, and are expected to continue in the short to medium term. due to the high degree of competition in the market place, these rate increases can lead to an erosion in our margins. as we are not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and have not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate-sensitive indebtedness, we currently have limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2020, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.

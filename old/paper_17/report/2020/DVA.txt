risks related to the operation of our business we face various risks related to the dynamic and evolving novel coronavirus pandemic, any of which may have a material adverse impact on us.
the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (covid-19) is impacting the world and our business in many different ways. the ultimate impact of covid-19 on us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including among other things, the severity and duration of the pandemic; further spread or resurgence of the virus, including as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus; its impact on the chronic kidney disease (ckd) population and our patient population; the availability, acceptance, impact and efficacy of covid-19 treatments, therapies and vaccines; the pandemic's continuing impact on the u.s. and global economies and unemployment; the responses of our competitors to the pandemic and related changes in the marketplace; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses. the impact could come in many forms, including but not limited to those described below.
•    we have experienced and expect to continue to experience a negative impact on revenue and non-acquired growth from covid-19 due to lower treatment volumes, including from the negative impact on our patient census that is the result of changes in rates of mortality. because esrd patients may be older and generally have comorbidities, several of which are risk factors for covid-19, we believe the mortality rate of infected patients is, and will continue to be, higher in the dialysis population than in the general population, and covid-19 also could impact the ckd population differentially. over the longer term, we believe that changes in mortality in both the ckd and esrd populations due to covid-19 will depend primarily on the infection rate, case fatality rate, the age and health status of affected patients, the access to and efficacy of vaccinations as well as willingness to be vaccinated. we expect that these changes are likely to continue to negatively impact our revenue and non-acquired growth even as the pandemic subsides. however, determining the extent to which these impacts should be directly attributable to covid-19 is difficult due to testing and reporting limitations, and other factors may drive treatment volumes and new admissions over time, such as the number of transplants or deferred admissions. the magnitude of these cumulative impacts has been substantial and, depending on the ultimate severity and duration of the pandemic could be material.
• the covid-19 pandemic and efforts to contain the virus have led to global economic deterioration and rapid and sharp increases in unemployment levels, which ultimately could result in a materially reduced share of our patients being covered by commercial insurance plans, with more patients being covered by lower-paying government insurance programs or being uninsured. these effects may persist after the pandemic subsides as, among other things, our patients could experience permanent changes in their insurance coverage as a result of changes to their employment status. in the event such a material reduction occurs in the share of our patients covered by commercial insurance plans, it would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the extent of these effects will depend upon, among other things, the extent and duration of the increased unemployment levels for our patient population, economic deterioration and potential recession; the timing and scope of federal, state and local governmental responses to the ongoing pandemic; and patients' ability to retain existing insurance and their individual choices with respect to their coverage.
• we have dedicated and continue to dedicate substantial resources in response to covid-19 and have had, and expect to continue to have, extended and significant additional costs in connection with our response to covid-19. the steps we have taken designed to help safely maintain continuity of care for our patients and help protect our caregivers, such as our policies to implement dedicated care shifts for patients with confirmed or suspected covid-19 and other enhanced clinical practices, have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, our expenses and use of personal protective equipment (ppe). our response to covid-19 also has resulted in higher salary and wage expense, and we have provided, and may provide in the future, substantial financial support associated with relief reimbursement to our teammates. furthermore, the effort and cost needed to procure certain of our equipment and clinical supplies, including ppe, have increased, and we expect these increased costs will continue while the pandemic persists. these efforts are part of a wider prepare, prevent, respond and recover protocol that we have implemented in connection with the pandemic, which also includes operational initiatives such as the redistribution of teammates, machines and supplies across the country as needed and increased investment in and utilization of telehealth capabilities. our response protocol generally has allowed us to maintain continuity of care for our patients. if the pandemic requires us to maintain certain restrictive operational protocols for an extended period of time, it may adversely impact our strategic initiatives, such as our strategy to continue to build o our abilities to offer home dialysis options. certain temporary changes made in response to the covid-19 pandemic could become permanent, which could have an adverse impact on our business. in addition, any equipment or clinical supply shortages, disruptions or delays or associated price increases could impact our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services.
• we have had, and expect to continue to have, increased costs and risk associated with a high demand for our skilled clinical personnel. historically we have faced costs and difficulties in hiring and retaining nurses and other caregivers due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel, and these challenges have been heightened by the increased demand for and demand upon such personnel by the ongoing pandemic, particularly the more recent resurgence of the virus that is more widespread geographically, which, among other things, makes it more difficult for us to reallocate our resources to affected geographies. any staffing shortages or disruptions could impact our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services.
• if we experience a failure of the fitness of our clinical laboratory, dialysis centers and related operations and/or other facilities as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, or another event or occurrence adversely impacts the safety of our caregivers or patients, we could face adverse consequences, including without limitation, material negative impact on our brand, increased litigation, compliance or regulatory investigations, teammate unrest, work stoppages or other workforce disruptions. any legal actions brought by patients, teammates, caregivers or others allegedly exposed to covid-19 at our facilities or by our caregivers may involve significant demands and require substantial legal defense costs, which may not be adequately covered by our professional and general liability insurance.
• if general economic conditions continue to deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets. we may experience an increased need for additional liquidity funded by accessing existing credit facilities, raising new debt in the capital markets, or other sources, and we may seek to refinance existing debt, which may be more difficult or costly as a result of the pandemic's impact on capital markets or on us. furthermore, any extended billing or collection cycles, or deterioration in collectability of accounts receivable, will adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
• in our value-based care and other programs where we assume financial accountability for total patient cost, an increase in covid-19 rates among patients could have an impact on total cost of care. this increase may in turn impact the profitability of those programs relative to their respective funding.
• the global nature of the pandemic may have varying impacts on our ongoing operations outside the united states, and may impact our ability to expand our operations into other parts of the world.
the government response to the pandemic has been wide-ranging and will continue to develop over time, particularly in light of the new federal administration. as a result, we may not be able to accurately predict the nature, timing or extent of resulting changes to the markets in which we conduct business or on the other participants that operate in those markets, or any potential changes to the extensive set of federal, state and local laws, regulations and requirements that govern our business. we believe that these changes may impact our business in a variety of ways, including but not limited to those described below.
• our need, ability and willingness to use and retain any provider relief or other funds or assistance from the government, the consequences of our decisions with respect thereto, our ability to operate within any restrictions on our business or operations that may be imposed as a condition to participation in any government assistance programs, and the impact of any such programs on our competitors, all will depend, among other things, on the magnitude, timing and nature of covid-19's impact on the company as well as the requirements of any such programs, which are uncertain. there can be no assurance that financial or other assistance will be available from the government if we have a need for such assistance in the future.
• state and local shelter in place and social distancing restrictions and guidance have required us to significantly increase the use of remote arrangements for our teammates and telehealth technology for our dialysis patients, which broadens our technology footprint for where and how protected health information is used or disclosed, and in turn increases our exposure to the various privacy and information security risks we face, such as the risk of "phishing" and other cybersecurity attacks and the risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information.
• we have worked with certain government agencies and other kidney care providers to respond to the covid-19 pandemic, and in certain cases have sought waivers of regulatory requirements. for example, as part of our efforts to help cohort patients in line with guidance from the cdc, we have sought waivers of certain regulatory requirements related to the survey and acceleration of new clinics and entered into agreements with other kidney care providers to help ensure that patients can receive dialysis in an outpatient setting rather than a hospital. in addition, we are also working to help make covid-19 vaccines available to patients and teammates, including through coordination with state and federal governments on direct vaccine distribution so that we can administer vaccines to our patients and teammates. these vaccines are currently available under emergency use authorizations and there can be no assurance that our patients and caregivers will choose to receive a covid-19 vaccine or that the vaccines will prove to be as safe and effective as currently understood by the scientific community. in addition, we may encounter difficulties with the availability, storage of the vaccine, or administration of the vaccines, some of which have multiple dose requirements. we operate in a complex and highly regulated environment, and the novel nature of our covid-19 response, including, for example, with respect to regulatory waivers and our administration of the newly developed covid-19 vaccines, may increase our exposure to legal, regulatory and clinical risks.
the foregoing and other continued impacts and disruptions to our business as a result of the covid-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our patients, teammates, physician partners, suppliers, business, operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or liquidity. in addition, the covid-19 pandemic heightens many of the other risks and uncertainties discussed herein. for additional information related to covid-19 and its impact on our business, see the discussion in part i, item 1. business under the headings, "covid-19 and its impact on our business" and "human capital management" and part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation.
we operate in a complex regulatory environment with an extensive and evolving set of federal, state and local governmental laws, regulations and other requirements that apply to us. these laws, regulations and other requirements are promulgated and overseen by a number of different legislative, regulatory, administrative, and quasi-regulatory bodies, each of which may have varying interpretations, judgments or related guidance. as such, we utilize considerable resources on an ongoing basis to monitor, assess and respond to applicable legislative, regulatory and administrative requirements, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to adhere to all of these requirements. laws, regulations and other requirements that apply to or impact our business include, but are not limited to:
•medicare and medicaid reimbursement statutes, rules and regulations (including, but not limited to, manual provisions, local coverage determinations, national coverage determinations, payment schedules and agency guidance);
•medicare and medicaid provider requirements, including requirements associated with providing and updating certain information about the medicare or medicaid entity, as applicable, and its direct and indirect affiliates;
•federal fraud waste and abuse laws and analogous state laws;
•the 21st century cures act (the cures act);
•federal acquisition regulations;
•the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa);
•federal and state antitrust and competition laws and regulations;
•laws related to the corporate practice of medicine;
•individualized state law requirements associated with the operation of our business; and
•federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information (e.g., health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa)) and the storage, handling, shipment, disposal and/or dispensing of pharmaceuticals and blood products and other biological materials.
in addition, we have been subject to a five-year corporate integrity agreement (cia) with office of inspector general (oig) for the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs). the term of the cia expired on october 22, 2019, and we were notified on may 20, 2020 that the oig had closed out its review. any future penalties, sanctions or other consequences imposed on us could be more severe in certain circumstances if the oig or a similar regulatory authority determines that we knowingly and repeatedly failed to comply with applicable laws, regulations or other requirements, and could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition or could have a negative impact on our reputation.
the foregoing are each themselves comprised of numerous associated regulations or other requirements that have varying levels of impact on our business. if any of our personnel, representatives or operations are found to violate these or other laws, regulations or requirements, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation and stock price, including, among others:
•loss of required certifications or suspension or exclusion from or termination of our participation in government programs (including, without limitation, medicare, medicaid and center for medicare and medicaid innovation (cmmi) demonstration programs);
•refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements dating back to the applicable statute of limitation periods;
•loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities or administer pharmaceuticals in the states in which we operate;
•reductions in payment rates or coverage for dialysis and ancillary services and pharmaceuticals;
•criminal or civil liability, fines, damages or monetary penalties, which could be material and/or could materially harm our reputation or stock price;
•imposition of corporate integrity agreements or consent agreements;
•enforcement actions, investigations, or audits by governmental agencies and/or state law claims for monetary damages by patients who believe their protected health information (phi) has been used, disclosed or not properly safeguarded in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including, among others, hipaa and the privacy act of 1974;
•mandated changes to our practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses that could subject us to ongoing audits and reporting requirements as well as increased scrutiny of our billing and business practices which could lead to potential fines, among other things;
•termination of various relationships and/or contracts related to our business, such as joint venture arrangements, medical director agreements, real estate leases and consulting agreements with physicians; and
•harm to our reputation which could negatively impact our business relationships and stock price, affect our ability to attract and retain patients, physicians and teammates, affect our ability to obtain financing and decrease access to new business opportunities, among other things.
additionally, the healthcare sector, including the dialysis industry, is also regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. negative publicity, regardless of merit, regarding the dialysis industry generally, the u.s. healthcare system or davita in particular may adversely affect us.
see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details regarding certain pending legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which we are or may be subject from time to time, any of which may include allegations of violations of applicable laws, regulations and requirements.
changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
each of the laws, regulations and other requirements that govern our business may continue to change over time, and there is no assurance that we will be able to accurately predict the nature, timing or extent of such changes or the impact of such changes on the markets in which we conduct business or on the other participants that operate in those markets.
among other things, the regulatory framework of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care reconciliation act of 2010, as amended (collectively, the aca), and other healthcare reforms continue to evolve as a result of executive, legislative, regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. these changes shape the landscape for our current dialysis business as well as for emerging comprehensive and integrated kidney care markets. for example, an executive order issued in july 2019 (the 2019 executive order) directed cms to create payment models through cmmi to evaluate the effects of creating payment incentives for the greater use of home-based dialysis and kidney transplants for those already on dialysis, improve quality of care for kidney patients and reduce expenditures. in addition, future legislative action related to, among other things, full capitation demonstration for esrd may ultimately impact our ability to provide a competitive and successful integrated care program at scale. we have made and continue to make investments in building our integrated care capabilities, but there can be no assurances that initiatives such as this or similar legislation will be passed into law, and the ongoing covid-19 pandemic may delay the progress of such initiatives. if such legislation is passed, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully execute on the required strategic initiatives that would allow us to provide a competitive and successful integrated care program on the broader scale contemplated by this legislation, and in the desired time frame. additionally, the ultimate terms and conditions of any such potential legislation remain unclear. for example, our costs of care could exceed our associated reimbursement rates under such legislation. any failure on our part to adequately implement strategic initiatives to adjust to any marketplace developments resulting from executive, legislative, regulatory or administrative changes such as these could have a material adverse impact on our business.
there have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the aca through legislative action and legal challenges, and the most recent challenge is currently before the u.s. supreme court. in the event the aca is repealed or significantly altered, it would impact our business in a number of ways, some of which may be material. the outcome of this u.s. supreme court proceeding will likely impact the future viability of aca policies and programs that impact our business, including, among others, medicaid expansion, cmmi and the health insurance exchanges. for example, if an aca repeal ends medicaid expansion it could have an adverse impact on coverage available to our patients and if such a repeal impacts cmmi's authority to implement innovative payment models, we may lose the investment of the resources we have dedicated to those programs. in addition, our revenue and operating income levels are highly sensitive to the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial health insurance and any legislative, regulatory or other changes that decrease the accessibility and availability, including the duration, of commercial insurance may have a material adverse impact on our business. the aca's health insurance exchanges, which provide a marketplace for eligible individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance, initially increased the accessibility and availability of commercial insurance. in the event the exchange markets are significantly impaired as a result of legislative developments or other changes, it may adversely impact the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial health insurance, particularly if patients become unemployed due to factors related to the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise and are unable to turn to the exchanges as an alternative to employer-based coverage.
changes to the political environment resulting from the most recent election cycle may increase the likelihood of changes that would impact us, such as changes to the healthcare regulatory landscape or to the federal corporate tax rate. examples of such potential changes could include, among other things, legislative developments or administrative decisions such as moving to a universal health insurance or "single payor" system whereby health insurance is provided to all americans by the government, the availability of a "public health insurance option" similar to medicare, government programs that impact access to medicaid expansion or impact funding provided to families to purchase plans through the health insurance exchanges or changes to the eligibility age for medicare beneficiaries. some of these and other related changes could in turn impact the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial health insurance, impact the scope or terms of coverage under commercial health plans and increase our expenses, among other things. the timing of any legislative or executive action related to these potential initiatives remains uncertain, particularly in light of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, and as such, considerable uncertainty exists surrounding the continued development of the aca and related regulations, programs and models, as well as similar healthcare reform measures and/or other changes that may be enacted at the federal and/or state level to laws, regulations and other requirements that govern our business. although we cannot predict the short- or long-term effects of legislative or regulatory changes, we believe that future market changes could result in, among other things, more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates or higher deductibles and co-payments that patients may not be able to pay. to the extent that changes in statutes, regulations or related guidance or changes in other market conditions result in a reduction in the percentage of our patients with commercial insurance, limit the scope or nature of coverage through the exchanges or other health insurance programs or otherwise reduce reimbursement rates for our services from commercial and/or government payors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for additional information on the impact of legislative or regulatory changes on the coverage and rates for our services and the percentage of our patients with commercial insurance, see the risk factors under the headings "we continuously have ongoing negotiations with commercial payors, and if the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or if we are unable to maintain contracts with payors with competitive terms, including, without limitation, reimbursement rates, scope and duration of coverage and in-network benefits, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows," and "if the number or percentage of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
the introduction of new or modified rules and regulations also generates continuous risks related to appropriate compliance. changes to the continuously evolving healthcare regulatory landscape may also have the potential to generate opportunities with relative ease of entry for certain smaller and/or non-traditional providers and we may be competing with them for patients in an asymmetrical environment with respect to data and/or regulatory requirements given our status as an esrd service provider. these opportunities may be enhanced by disruptions or changes to the healthcare regulatory landscape resulting from the ongoing global health crisis. for additional detail on our evolving competitive environment, see the risk factor under the heading "if we are unable to compete successfully, including, without limitation, implementing our growth strategy and/or retaining patients and physicians willing to serve as medical directors, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." in general, if we are unable to efficiently and effectively adjust to new or modified rules and regulations, including with respect to regulatory compliance, it may, among other things, erode our patient base or reimbursement rates and could otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
there have also been several state initiatives to limit payments to dialysis providers or impose other burdensome operational requirements, which, if passed, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flow. for instance, in 2020, voters in california considered a statewide ballot initiative that sought to impose certain regulatory requirements on dialysis clinics, including requirements related to physician staffing levels, clinical reporting, clinical treatment options and limitations on the ability to make decisions on closing or reducing services for dialysis clinics. while this ballot initiative was rejected by voters in 2020, we incurred substantial costs to oppose it. we may face ballot initiatives or other proposed regulations or legislation in california or other states in future years, which may require us to incur further substantial costs and which, if passed, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
finally, there have also been rule making and legislative efforts at both the federal and state level regarding the use of charitable premium assistance for esrd patients and may establish new conditions for coverage standards for dialysis facilities. for example, on october 13, 2019, a california bill (ab 290) was signed into law that limits the amount of reimbursement paid to certain providers for services provided to patients with commercial insurance who receive charitable premium assistance. the american kidney fund (akf), an organization that provides charitable premium assistance, announced that it would be withdrawing from california as a result of ab 290. the implementation of ab 290 has been stayed pending resolution of legal challenges, but in the event ab 290 becomes effective and the akf withdraws from california, it may cause other organizations that provide charitable premium assistance to withdraw from california, and we would expect an adverse impact on the ability of patients to afford medicare premiums and medicare supplemental and commercial coverage. we expect that such an adverse impact will in turn adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. bills similar to ab 290 were introduced in illinois (sb 600) and oregon (sb 900) in 2019, but have not been successfully passed to date. if these or similar bills are introduced and implemented in other jurisdictions, and organizations that provide charitable premium assistance in those jurisdictions are similarly impacted, it could in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for additional information on the impact of decreases to the percentage of our patients with commercial insurance, see the risk factor under the heading "if the number or percentage of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows".
among other things, regulatory guidance, proposed legislation and ballot initiatives and any similar initiatives could restrict or prohibit the ability of patients with access to alternative coverage from selecting a marketplace plan on or off exchange, limit the amount of revenue that a dialysis provider can retain for caring for patients with commercial insurance, impose burdensome operational requirements, affect payments made to providers for services provided to patients who receive charitable premium assistance and/or otherwise restrict or prohibit the use of charitable premium assistance, or reduce the standards for network adequacy. in turn, these potential impacts could cause us to incur substantial costs to oppose any such proposed requirements or measures, impact our dialysis center development plans, and if passed and/or implemented, could materially reduce our revenues and increase our operating and other costs, adversely impact dialysis centers across the u.s. making certain centers economically unviable, lead to the closure of certain centers, restrict the ability of dialysis patients to obtain and maintain optimal insurance coverage and reduce the number of patients that select commercial insurance plans or ma plans for their dialysis care, among other things.
evolving proposed or issued laws, requirements, rules and guidance that impact our business, including as may be described above, and any failure on our part to adequately adjust to any resulting marketplace developments, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
to the extent that the information above describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions that are referenced. for additional information related to the laws, rules and other regulations described above, please see part i, item 1 "business-government regulation" of this form 10-k.
we are, and may in the future be, a party to various lawsuits, demands, claims, qui tam suits, governmental investigations and audits and other legal matters, any of which could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, mandated refunds, substantial payments made by us, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in medicare, medicaid and other healthcare programs and possible criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price.
we are, and may in the future be, subject to investigations and audits by governmental agencies and/or private civil qui tam complaints filed by relators and other lawsuits, demands, claims and legal proceedings, including, without limitation, investigations or other actions resulting from our obligation to self-report suspected violations of law.
responding to subpoenas, investigations and other lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings as well as defending ourselves in such matters will continue to require management's attention and cause us to incur significant legal expense. negative findings or terms and conditions that we might agree to accept as part of a negotiated resolution of pending or future legal or regulatory matters could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, substantial payments made by us, harm to our reputation, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in medicare, medicaid and other healthcare programs and, in certain cases, criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. it is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us and/or individuals in our business in connection with governmental investigations. other than as may be described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of the various legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which we are or may be subject from time to time, or the timing of their resolution or the ultimate losses or impact of developments in those matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details regarding these and other legal proceedings and regulatory matters.
privacy and information security laws are complex, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems or defend against cybersecurity attacks, we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches or suffer losses to our data and information technology assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or materially harm our reputation.
we must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations in both the u.s. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and privacy of phi, including, without limitation, hipaa and its implementing privacy, security, and related regulations, as amended by the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act (hitech) and collectively referred to as hipaa. we are also required to report known breaches of phi and other certain personal information consistent with applicable breach reporting requirements set forth in applicable laws and regulations. from time to time, we may be subject to both federal and state inquiries or audits related to hipaa, hitech and other state privacy laws associated with complaints, desk audits, and data breaches. if we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information, including phi, on our behalf, properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, it could materially harm our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. these risks may be intensified to the extent that the laws change or to the extent that we increase our use of third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information, including phi, on our behalf.
data protection laws are evolving globally, and may continue to add additional compliance costs and legal risks to our international operations. in europe, the general data protection regulation (gdpr) imposes a comprehensive data protection regime with the potential for regulatory fines as well as data breach litigation by impacted data subjects. under the gdpr, regulatory penalties may be assessed by data protection authorities for up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover or €20 million.
data protection laws are also evolving nationally, and may add additional compliance costs and legal risks to our u.s. operations. for example, the california consumer privacy act (ccpa) and california privacy rights act (cpra) have been passed into law in the past several years, and they collectively expand our obligations related to the collection, use and sharing of consumer data and also permit additional penalties, grant additional enforcement authority and authorize private rights of action. the costs of compliance with, and the burdens imposed by, the gdpr, the ccpa, the cpra or other new laws, regulations or policies may impact our operations and/or limit the ways in which we can provide services or use personal data collected while providing services. if we fail to comply with the requirements of gdpr, the ccpa, the cpra or other new laws, regulations or policies, we could be subject to penalties that, in some cases, would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for more information on regulations affecting our business, see "business-government regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
scrutiny over cybersecurity standards in the health sector is also increasing. in particular, the hhs office for civil rights, in partnership with the healthcare and public health sector coordinating council (hscc), recently issued cybersecurity guidelines for healthcare organizations that reflect consensus-based, voluntary practices to cost-effectively reduce cybersecurity risks for organizations of varying sizes. although these hhs-backed guidelines, entitled "health industry cybersecurity practices: managing threats and protecting patients," are voluntary, they are likely to serve as an important reference point for the healthcare industry, and may cause us to invest additional resources in technology, personnel and programmatic cybersecurity controls as the cybersecurity risks we face continue to evolve.
information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including, among others, foreign state agents. our business and operations rely on the secure and continuous processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks, including sensitive personal information, such as phi, social security numbers, and/or credit card information of our patients, teammates, physicians, business partners and others. our business and operations also rely on certain critical it vendors that support such processing, transmission and storage (which have become more relevant and important given the information security issues and risks that are intensified through remote work arrangements).
we regularly review, monitor and implement multiple layers of security measures through technology, processes and our people. we utilize security technologies designed to protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. despite these efforts, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft; computer viruses and other malicious code; coordinated attacks by a variety of actors, including, among others, activist entities or state sponsored cyberattacks; emerging cybersecurity risks; cyber risk related to connected devices; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or human errors; or other similar events that could impact the security, reliability and availability of our systems. internal or external parties may attempt to circumvent our security systems, and we have in the past, and expect that we will in the future, experience attacks on our network including, without limitation, reconnaissance probes, denial of service attempts, malicious software attacks including ransomware or other attacks intended to render our internal operating systems or data unavailable, and phishing attacks or business email compromise. cybersecurity requires ongoing investment and diligence against evolving threats. emerging and advanced security threats, including, without limitation, coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. as with any security program, there always exists the risk that employees will violate our policies despite our compliance efforts or that certain attacks may be beyond the ability of our security and other systems to detect. there can be no assurance that investments, diligence and/or our internal controls will be sufficient to prevent or timely discover an attack.
any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, including, among others, phi, financial data, competitively sensitive information, or other proprietary data, whether by us or a third party, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and materially harm our reputation. we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, or to make required notifications. the occurrence of any of these events could, among other things, result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems and liability under privacy and security laws, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, or materially harm our reputation and trigger regulatory actions and private party litigation. if we are unable to protect the physical and electronic security and privacy of our databases and transactions, we could be subject to potential liability and regulatory action, our reputation and relationships with our patients, physicians, vendors and other business partners would be harmed, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems (including our networks) and data, or to defend against cybersecurity attacks, could subject us to monetary fines, civil suits, civil penalties or criminal sanctions and requirements to disclose the breach publicly, and could further result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or harm our reputation. as malicious cyber activity escalates, including activity that originates outside of the u.s., and as our covid-19 response increases our remote work arrangements and broadens our technology footprint, the risks we face relating to transmission of data and our use of service providers outside of our network, as well as the storing or processing of data within our network, intensify. there have been increased international, federal and state and other privacy, data protection and security enforcement efforts and we expect this trend to continue. while we plan to maintain cyber liability insurance, there can be no assurance that we will successfully be able to obtain such insurance on terms and conditions that are favorable to us or at all. additionally, any cyber liability insurance may not cover us for all types of losses and may not be sufficient to protect us against the amount of all losses.
we continuously have ongoing negotiations with commercial payors, and if the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or if we are unable to maintain contracts with payors with competitive terms, including, without limitation, reimbursement rates, scope and duration of coverage and in-network benefits, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
a substantial portion of our u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 was generated from patients who have commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) as their primary payor. the majority of these patients have insurance policies that pay us on terms and at rates that are generally significantly higher than medicare rates. the payments we receive from commercial payors generate nearly all of our profit and all of our nonacute dialysis profits come from commercial payors. we continue to experience downward pressure on some of our commercial payment rates as a result of general conditions in the market, including as employers shift to less expensive options for medical services, as a result of consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on dialysis services and other factors. commercial payment rates could be materially lower in the future due to these or other factors.
we continuously are in the process of negotiating existing and potential new agreements with commercial payors who aggressively negotiate terms with us, and we can make no assurances about the ultimate results of these negotiations or the timing of any potential rate changes resulting from these negotiations. sometimes many significant agreements are being renegotiated at the same time. in the event that our ongoing negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, the cumulative effect could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we believe payor consolidations have significantly increased the negotiating leverage of commercial payors, and ongoing consolidations may continue to increase this leverage in the future. our negotiations with payors occur in a highly competitive environment and are also influenced by these marketplace dynamics, and we may experience decreased contracted rates with commercial payors or experience decreases in patient volume, including in instances where we are unable to come to agreement with commercial payors on rates, as our negotiations with commercial payors continue.
our negotiations with commercial payors may relate to commercial fee-for-service contracts, value-based care (vbc) contracts in which we share risk with commercial payors, as well as contracts to provide dialysis services to medicare part c medicare advantage (ma) patients. if we fail to maintain contracts with payors and other healthcare providers with competitive or favorable terms, either with respect to commercial plans, commercial vbc contracts, ma plans or otherwise, including, without limitation, with respect to reimbursement rates, scope and duration of coverage and in-network benefits, or if we fail to accurately estimate the price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner such that the profitability of our value-based products is negatively impacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
these negotiations may also be impacted by legislative or regulatory developments and associated legal rulings. for example, the final rules for the cures act included a provision that, effective january 1, 2021, allows medicare-eligible beneficiaries with esrd to choose coverage under a ma managed care plan. this provision could broaden patient access to certain enhanced benefits offered by ma plans. ma plans usually provide reimbursement to us at a negotiated rate that is generally higher than medicare fee-for-service rates. we continue to evaluate the potential ultimate impact of this change in benefit eligibility, as there is significant uncertainty as to how many or which newly eligible esrd patients will seek to enroll in ma plans for their esrd benefits and how quickly any such changes would occur. this uncertainty may be heightened by components of the aforementioned final rules, which include a provision that, among other things, removes the objective time and distance standards relating to network adequacy for outpatient dialysis centers for ma plans. if ma plans attempt to use this revision to the rules to limit or restrict their networks, this may adversely impact the number of esrd patients that select ma plans and also may result in the company not being an in-network provider for significant ma plans. if kidney patients choose not to enroll in ma plans or choose to leave ma plans, whether due to network adequacy standards or otherwise, or if we fail to provide education to kidney patients in the manner specified by cms, we could be subject to certain clinical, operational, financial and legal risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, recent price and patient responsibility transparency regulations require health plans to make certain pricing and patient responsibility information publicly available. certain of the requirements went into effect january 1, 2021 while others will go into effect january 1, 2024. there is a possibility that any changes by health plans resulting from these regulations could impact our revenue and results of operations.
certain payors have also been attempting to design and implement plans that restrict access to esrd coverage both in the commercial and individual market. among other things, these restrictive plan designs seek to limit the duration and/or the breadth of esrd benefits, limit the number of in-network providers, set arbitrary provider reimbursement rates, or otherwise restrict access to care, all of which may result in a decrease in the number of patients covered by commercial insurance. payors have also disputed the scope and duration of esrd benefit coverage under their plans. any of the foregoing, including developments in plan design or new business activities of commercial payors, may lead to a significant decrease in the number of patients with commercial plans, the duration of benefits for patients under commercial plans and/or a significant decrease in the payment rates we receive, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in addition, some commercial payors are pursuing or have incorporated policies into their provider manuals limiting or refusing to accept charitable premium assistance from non-profit organizations, such as the american kidney fund, which may impact the number of patients who are able to afford commercial plans. paying for coverage is a significant financial burden for many patients, and esrd disproportionately affects the low-income population. charitable premium assistance supports continuity of coverage and access to care for patients, many of whom are unable to continue working full-time as a result of their severe condition. a material restriction in patients' ability to access charitable premium assistance may restrict the ability of dialysis patients to obtain and maintain optimal insurance coverage, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
for additional details regarding the impact of a decline in our patients under commercial plans, see the risk factor under the heading "if the number or percentage of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." for additional details regarding specific risks we face regarding potential legislative or regulatory changes that, among other things, could result in fewer patients covered under commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates, see the discussion in the risk factor under the headings "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation;" and "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
if the number or percentage of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our revenue levels are sensitive to the number of our patients with higher-paying commercial insurance coverage and the percentage of our patients under higher-paying commercial plans relative to government-based programs. a patient's insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including changes in the patient's or a family member's employment status. a material portion of our commercial revenue is concentrated with a limited number of commercial payors, and any changes impacting our highest paying commercial payors will have a disproportionate impact on us. in addition, many patients with commercial and government insurance rely on financial assistance from charitable organizations, such as the american kidney fund. certain payors have challenged our patients' and other providers' patients' ability to utilize assistance from charitable organizations for the payment of premiums, including, without limitation, through litigation and other legal proceedings. the use of charitable premium assistance for esrd patients has also faced challenges and inquiries from legislators, regulators and other governmental authorities, and this may continue. in addition, cms or another regulatory agency or legislative authority may issue a new rule or guidance that challenges or restricts charitable premium assistance. for additional details, see the risk factor under the headings "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation;" and "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." if any of these challenges to kidney patients' use of premium assistance is successful or restrictions are imposed on the use of financial assistance from such charitable organizations or if organizations providing such assistance are no longer available such that kidney patients are unable to obtain, or continue to receive or receive for a limited duration, such financial assistance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, if our assumptions about how kidney patients will respond to any change in financial assistance from charitable organizations are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
when medicare becomes the primary payor for a patient, the payment rate we receive for that patient decreases from the employer group health plan or commercial plan rate to the lower medicare payment rate. if the number of our patients who have medicare or another government-based program as their primary payor increases, it could negatively impact the percentage of our patients covered under commercial insurance plans. there are a number of factors that could drive a decline in the percentage of our patients covered under commercial insurance plans, including, among others, a continued decline in the rate of growth of the esrd patient population, continued improved mortality or the reduced availability of commercial health plans or reduced coverage by such plans through the aca exchanges or otherwise due to changes to the marketplace, healthcare regulatory system or otherwise. commercial payors could also cease paying in the primary position after providing 30 months of coverage resulting in potentially material reductions in payment as the patient moves to medicare primary. moreover, declining macroeconomic conditions, such as, for example, those resulting from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, could also negatively impact the percentage of our patients covered under commercial insurance plans. to the extent there are sustained or increased job losses in the u.s., we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under commercial plans and/or an increase in uninsured and underinsured patients independent of whether general economic conditions improve. if we experience higher numbers of uninsured or underinsured patients, it also would result in an increase in uncollectible accounts.
finally, the ultimate results of our continual negotiations with commercial payors under existing and potential new agreements cannot be predicted and, among other things, could result in a decrease in the number of our patients covered by commercial plans to the extent that we cannot reach agreement with commercial payors on rates and other terms, resulting in termination or non-renewals of existing agreements and our inability to enter into new agreements. our agreements and rates with commercial payors may be impacted by new business activities of these commercial payors as well as steps that these commercial payors have taken and may continue to take to control the cost of and/or the eligibility for access to the services that we provide, including, without limitation, relative to products on and off the healthcare exchanges. these efforts could impact the number of our patients who are eligible to enroll in commercial insurance plans, and remain on the plans, including plans offered through healthcare exchanges. for additional detail on the risks related to commercial payor activity, including restrictive plan design, see the discussion under the heading "we continuously have ongoing negotiations with commercial payors, and if the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or if we are unable to maintain contracts with payors with competitive terms, including, without limitation, reimbursement rates, scope and duration of coverage and in-network benefits, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." we could also experience a further decrease in the payments we receive for services if changes to the marketplace or the healthcare regulatory system result in fewer patients covered under commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates, among other things.
if there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher-paying commercial plans relative to government-based programs that pay at lower rates or a significant increase in the number of patients that are uninsured and underinsured, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
if we are not able to successfully implement our strategy with respect to home-based dialysis, including maintaining our existing business and further developing our capabilities in a complex and highly regulated environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation.
our home-based dialysis services, which include home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (pd), represented approximately 17% of our u.s. dialysis patient services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020, and have increasingly become an important part of our overall strategy. in addition, home-based dialysis recently has been the subject of increased political and industry focus. for example, in connection with the 2019 executive order, hhs set out specific goals related to home dialysis and cmmi's esrd treatment choices mandatory payment model (etc) included new incentives to encourage dialysis at home. we are a leader in home-based dialysis and have made investments in processes and infrastructure to continue to grow this modality. there are, however, risks associated with this growth, including, among other things, financial, legal and operational risks related to our ability to design and develop infrastructure and to plan for capacity in a modality that is part of an evolving marketplace. we may also be subject to associated risks related to our ability to successfully manage related operational initiatives, find, train and retain appropriate staff, contract with payors for appropriate reimbursement, and maintain processes to adhere to the complex regulatory and legal requirements, including without limitation those associated with billing medicare. for additional detail on risks associated with operating in a highly regulated environment, see "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation." in addition to the above risks, certain risks inherent to home-based dialysis will increase as we expand our home-based dialysis offerings, including risks related to managing transitions between in-center and home-based dialysis, billing and telehealth systems, among others. for additional detail on risks associated with information systems and new technology generally, see the risk factor under the heading "failing to effectively maintain, operate or upgrade our information systems or those of third-party service providers upon which we rely, including, without limitation, our clinical, billing and collections systems could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
an increased focus on home-based dialysis is also indicative of the generally evolving market for kidney care. this developing market may create additional opportunities for competition with relative ease of entry, and if we are unable to successfully adapt to these marketplace developments in a timely and compliant manner, we may see a reduction in our overall number of patients, among other things. our response to the covid-19 pandemic has also required us to impose certain operational restrictions that may adversely impact certain home-based dialysis initiatives, and the extent of this impact may depend on the severity or duration of the pandemic, among other things. for additional detail on the competitive landscape in kidney care, see the risk factor under the heading "if we are unable to compete successfully, including, without limitation, implementing our growth strategy and/or retaining patients and physicians willing to serve as medical directors, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows," and for additional detail on the impact of covid-19 on our home-based dialysis business, see the risk factor under the heading "we face various risks related to the dynamic and evolving novel coronavirus pandemic, any of which may have a material adverse impact on us." if we are not able to successfully implement our strategy with respect to home-based dialysis, including maintaining our existing business and further developing our capabilities in a complex and highly regulated environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation.
changes in the structure of and payment rates under the medicare esrd program could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
a substantial portion of our dialysis revenues are generated from patients who have medicare as their primary payor. for patients with medicare coverage, all esrd payments for dialysis treatments are currently made under a single bundled payment rate which provides a fixed payment rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment that are related to the treatment of dialysis, subject to certain adjustments as described below. most lab services are also included in the bundled payment.
under the esrd prospective payment system (pps), bundled payments to a dialysis facility may be reduced by as much as 2% based on the facility's performance in specified quality measures set annually by cms through the esrd quality incentive program, which was established by the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008. the bundled payment rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index and certain other factors. in addition, the esrd pps is subject to rebasing, which can have a positive financial effect, or a negative one if the government fails to rebase in a manner that adequately addresses the costs borne by dialysis facilities. similarly, as new drugs, services or labs are added to the esrd bundle, cms' failure to adequately calculate the costs associated with the drugs, services or labs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in certain instances, new injectable, intravenous or oral products may be reimbursed separately from the bundled payment through a transitional drug add-on payment adjustment (tdapa). for a discussion of certain risks associated with this transitional pricing process, see the risk factor under the heading, "changes in clinical practices, payment rates or regulations impacting pharmaceuticals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and negatively impact our ability to care for patients."
the current bundled payment system presents certain operating, clinical and financial risks, which include, without limitation:
•risk that our rates are reduced by cms. cms publishes a final rule for the esrd pps each year and uncertainty about future payment rates remains a material risk to our business.
•risk that cms, on its own or through its contracted medicare administrative contractors (macs) or otherwise, implements local coverage determinations (lcds) or implements payment provisions, policy or regulatory mandates, including changes to the existing or future pps, that limit our ability to either be paid for covered dialysis services or bill for treatments or other drugs and services or other rules that may impact reimbursement. such payment rules and regulations and coverage determinations or related decisions could have an adverse impact on our operations and revenue. there is also risk commercial insurers could seek to incorporate the requirements or limitations associated with such lcds or cms guidance into their contracted terms with dialysis providers, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue.
•risk that a mac, or multiple macs, change their interpretations of existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance, or seek to implement or enforce new interpretations that are inconsistent with how we have interpreted existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance.
•risk that cms implements data and related reporting requirements that result in decreased reimbursement and/or increased technology and operational costs.
•risk that increases in our operating costs will outpace the medicare rate increases we receive. we expect operating costs to continue to increase due to inflationary factors, such as increases in labor and supply costs, including, without limitation, increases in maintenance costs and capital expenditures to improve, renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet changing regulatory requirements and business needs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.
•risk of continued federal budget sequestration cuts or other disruptions in federal government operations and funding. as a result of the budget control act of 2011, the bipartisan budget act (bba) and the cares act, an annual 2% reduction to medicare payments took effect on april 1, 2013, and has been extended through 2030 (though the reduction was temporarily suspended from may 1, 2020 through march 31, 2021 in connection with covid-19 relief related legislation). these across-the-board spending cuts have affected and will continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. any extended disruption in federal government operations and funding, including an extended government shutdown, u.s. government debt default and/or failure of the u.s. government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may delay or negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations, and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming regulatory developments.
•risk that failure to adequately develop and maintain our clinical systems or failure of our clinical systems to operate effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for example, in connection with claims for which at least part of the government's payments to us is based on clinical performance or patient outcomes or co-morbidities, if our clinical systems fail to accurately capture the data we report to cms or we otherwise have data integrity issues with respect to the reported information, we might be over-reimbursed by the government, which could, among other things, subject us to liability exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and penalties under the federal civil monetary penalty statute and could adversely impact our reputation.
we are subject to similar risks for services billed separately from the esrd bundled payment, including, without limitation, the risk that a mac, or multiple macs, change their interpretations of existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance; or seek to implement or enforce new interpretations that are inconsistent with how we have interpreted existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance.
in addition to the above risks under the current medicare esrd program, changing legislation and other regulatory and executive developments have led and may continue to lead to the emergence of new models of care and other initiatives in both the government and private sector that, among other things, may impact the structure of, and payment rates under, the medicare esrd program. moreover, the number of our patients with primary medicare coverage may be subject to change, particularly with the effectiveness of the cures act, which allows medicare-eligible individuals with esrd to enroll in medicare part c ma managed care plans. for additional details regarding the risks we face for failing to adhere to our medicare and medicaid regulatory compliance obligations or failing to adequately implement strategic initiatives to adjust to marketplace developments, see the risk factor above under the headings "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation;" and "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
changes in clinical practices, payment rates or regulations impacting pharmaceuticals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and negatively impact our ability to care for patients.
medicare bundles certain pharmaceuticals into the esrd pps payment rate at industry average doses and prices. variations above the industry average may be subject to partial reimbursement through the pps outlier reimbursement policy.
changes to industry averages, which can be caused by, among other things, changes in physician prescribing practices, including in response to the introduction of new drugs, treatments or technologies, changes in best and/or accepted clinical practice, changes in private or governmental payment criteria regarding pharmaceuticals, or the introduction of administration policies may negatively impact our ability to obtain sufficient reimbursement levels for the care we provide, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. physician practice patterns, including their independent determinations as to appropriate pharmaceuticals and dosing, are subject to change, including, for example, as a result of changes in labeling of pharmaceuticals or the introduction of new pharmaceuticals. additionally, commercial payors have increasingly examined their administration policies for pharmaceuticals and, in some cases, have modified those policies. if such policy and practice trends or other changes to private and governmental payment criteria make it more difficult to preserve our margins per treatment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. further, increased utilization of certain pharmaceuticals whose costs are included in a bundled reimbursement rate, or decreases in reimbursement for pharmaceuticals whose costs are not included in a bundled reimbursement rate, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
regulations and processes impacting reimbursement for pharmaceuticals and any changes thereto could similarly affect our operating results. for example, from january 1, 2018 to december 31, 2020, calcimimetics was part of the medicare part b payment and was subject to a tdapa period prior to being incorporated into the payment bundle on january 1, 2021. during this transitional period, the wider availability of generic supplies of oral calcimimetics drove the acquisition cost of that drug down, which in turn lowered associated reimbursement rates and led to significant fluctuations in our levels of operating income. in addition, we anticipate that a hypoxia-inducible factor (hif) product could be approved by the fda and available to the market during 2021, but as of the date hereof, the timing and details of such an approval, including the contents of the applicable fda label, remain uncertain. we expect that hif products will be subject to a tdapa period prior to being incorporated into the payment bundle. we are developing operational and clinical processes designed to provide the drug as may be required under the applicable regulations and as may be prescribed by physicians and also are working to contract with manufacturers of drug(s) to establish terms and access to the product, as well as payors, as applicable, for reimbursement and/or administration of the drug. if hif products are approved, we could experience significant fluctuations in our associated levels of operating income and could be subject to material financial, operational and/or legal risk if we are not adequately reimbursed for the cost of the drug, if we are unable to implement effective and appropriate operational measures to distribute the drug, if we fail to implement appropriate storage and diversion controls or if we cannot obtain competitive pricing for the hif, the aggregate impact of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
similar operating and clinical rigor and appropriate processes will be needed for other potential new drugs, treatments or technologies that are approved and come onto the market. any failure to successfully contract with manufacturers for competitive pricing, failure to successfully contract with the government or other payors for appropriate reimbursement, or failure to prepare, develop and implement processes that provide for appropriate availability and use in our clinics could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. additionally, as new kidney care drugs, treatments or technologies are introduced over time, we expect that the use of transitional payment adjustments to incorporate certain of these new drugs, treatments or technologies as defined by the cms policy into the bundled medicare part b esrd payment may lead to fluctuations in associated levels of operating income and risk that the reimbursement levels of such drugs, treatments or technologies may not adequately cover our cost to obtain the drug or other associated costs. drivers of these risks include, among other things, the risk that cms may not provide adequate funding in the medicare part b esrd payment in the post-transitional period or such items are not covered by transitional add on pricing, in which case there may be less clarity on the reimbursement, either of which may in turn materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we may also be subject to increased inquiries or audits from a variety of governmental bodies or claims by third parties related to pharmaceuticals, which would require management's attention and could result in significant legal expense. any negative findings could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or repayment obligations, the imposition of certain obligations on and changes to our practices and procedures as well as the attendant financial burden on us to comply with the obligations, or exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. for additional details, see the risk factor under the heading "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation."
changes in state medicaid or other non-medicare government-based programs or payment rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
primary coverage for a significant number of our patients comes from state medicaid programs partially funded by the federal government as well as other non-medicare government-based programs, such as coverage through the department of veterans affairs (va). as state governments and other governmental organizations face increasing financial hardship and budgetary pressure, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we may in turn face reductions in payment rates, delays in the receipt of payments, limitations on enrollee eligibility or other changes to the applicable programs. for example, certain state medicaid programs and the va have recently considered, proposed or implemented payment rate reductions.
the va adopted medicare's bundled pps pricing methodology for any veterans receiving treatment from non-va providers under a national contracting initiative. since we are a non-va provider, these reimbursements are tied to a percentage of medicare reimbursement, and we have exposure to any dialysis reimbursement changes made by cms. approximately 3% of our u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 were generated by the va.
in 2019, we entered into a nationwide dialysis services contract with the va that includes five separate one-year renewal periods throughout the term of the contract. the term structure is similar to our prior five-year agreement with the va, and is consistent with va practice for similar provider agreements. with this contract award, the va has agreed to keep our percentage of medicare reimbursement consistent with that under our prior agreement with the va during the term of the contract. as with that prior agreement, this agreement provides the va with the right to terminate the agreements without cause on short notice, among other things. should the va renegotiate, not renew or cancel these agreements for any reason, we may cease accepting patients under this program and may be forced to close centers or experience lower reimbursement rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
state medicaid programs are increasingly adopting medicare-like bundled payment systems, but sometimes these payment systems are poorly defined and are implemented without any claims processing infrastructure, or patient or facility adjusters. if these payment systems are implemented without any adjusters and claims processing infrastructure, medicaid payments will be substantially reduced and the costs to submit such claims may increase, which will have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, some state medicaid program eligibility requirements mandate that citizen enrollees in such programs provide documented proof of citizenship. if our patients cannot meet these proof of citizenship documentation requirements, they may be denied coverage under these programs, resulting in decreased patient volumes and revenue. these medicaid payment and enrollment changes, along with similar changes to other non-medicare government programs, could reduce the rates paid by these programs for dialysis and related services, delay the receipt of payment for services provided and further limit eligibility for coverage which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
if we are unable to compete successfully, including, without limitation, implementing our growth strategy and/or retaining patients and physicians willing to serve as medical directors, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
patient retention and the continued referrals of patients from referral sources such as hospitals and nephrologists, as well as acquisitions, are some of the important parts of our growth strategy. in our u.s. dialysis business, we continue to face intense competition from large and medium-sized providers, among others, which compete directly with us for the limited acquisition targets as well as for individual patients and physicians qualified to serve as medical directors. u.s. regulations require medical directors for each center. as we and our competitors continue to grow and open new dialysis centers, we may not be able to retain an adequate number of nephrologists to serve as medical directors. competition in existing and expanding geographies or areas is intense, and is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources or to established participants in the dialysis space. we also compete with individual nephrologists who have opened their own dialysis units or facilities. moreover, as we continue our expansion into various international markets, we will continue to face competition from large and medium-sized providers, among others, for acquisition targets.
in addition, fresenius medical group, our largest competitor, manufactures a full line of dialysis supplies and equipment in addition to owning and operating dialysis centers. this may, among other things, give it cost advantages over us because of its ability to manufacture its own products. see further discussion regarding risks associated with our suppliers and new technologies under the heading "if certain of our suppliers do not meet our needs, if there are material price increases on supplies, if we are not reimbursed or adequately reimbursed for drugs we purchase or if we are unable to effectively access new technology or superior products, it could negatively impact our ability to effectively provide the services we offer and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
in addition to traditional dialysis providers, there have been a number of announcements by non-traditional dialysis providers and others, which relate to entry into the dialysis and pre-dialysis space, the development of innovative technologies, or the commencement of new business activities that could be disruptive to the industry. some of these new entrants have considerable financial resources. although these and other potential competitors may face operational or financial challenges, the highly-competitive and evolving dialysis and pre-dialysis marketplaces have presented some opportunities for relative ease of entry for these and other potential competitors. as a result, we may compete with these smaller or non-traditional providers or others in an asymmetrical environment with respect to data and regulatory requirements that we face as an esrd service provider, thereby negatively impacting our ability to effectively compete. these and other factors have continued to drive change in the dialysis and pre-dialysis space, and if we are unable to successfully adapt to these dynamics, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
furthermore, each of the aforementioned competitive pressures and related risks may be impacted by a continued decline in the rate of growth of the esrd patient population, higher mortality rates for dialysis patients or other reductions in demand for dialysis treatments. the recent 2020 annual data report from the united states renal data system (usrds) suggests that the rate of growth of the esrd patient population is declining relative to long term trends. a number of factors may impact esrd growth rates, including, without limitation, the aging of the u.s. population, incidence rates for diseases that cause kidney failure such as diabetes and hypertension, transplant rates, mortality rates for dialysis patients and growth rates of minority populations with higher than average incidence rates of esrd. certain of these factors, in particular the mortality rates for dialysis patients, have been impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. the magnitude of these cumulative covid-19 related impacts on our patient census and treatment volumes has been substantial and depending on the ultimate severity and duration of the pandemic, could be material. for additional information, see the risk factor under the heading "changes in the structure of and payment rates under the medicare esrd program could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
if we are not able to effectively implement our growth strategy, including by making acquisitions at the desired pace or at all; if we are not able to continue to maintain the expected or desired level of non-acquired growth; or if we experience significant patient attrition either as a result of new business activities in the dialysis or pre-dialysis space by our existing competitors, other market participants, new entrants, new technology or other forms of competition, or as a result of reductions in demand for dialysis treatments, including, without limitation, due to increased mortality rates for dialysis patients resulting from covid-19 or otherwise, reduced prevalence of esrd or an increase in the number of kidney transplants, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions, which may materially affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of our business, and, under certain circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation.
our business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as through entry into joint ventures. we may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business lines or models, which may affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of our business. there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or merger partners or buyers for dispositions or that, if identified, we will be able to agree to terms with merger partners, acquire these targets or make these dispositions on acceptable terms or on the desired timetable. there can also be no assurance that we will be successful in completing any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we announce, executing new business lines or models or integrating any acquired business into our overall operations. there is no guarantee that we will be able to operate acquired businesses successfully as stand-alone businesses, or that any such acquired business will operate profitably or will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or materially harm our reputation. in addition, acquisition, merger or joint venture activity conducted as part of our overall growth strategy is subject to antitrust and competition laws, and antitrust regulators can investigate future (or pending) and consummated transactions. these laws could impact our ability to pursue these transactions, and under certain circumstances, could result in mandated divestitures, among other things. if a proposed transaction or series of transactions is subject to challenge under antitrust or competition laws, we may incur substantial legal costs, management's attention and resources may be diverted, and if we are found to have violated these or other related laws, regulations or requirements, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation and stock price. for additional detail, see the risk factor under the heading "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation." further, we cannot be certain that key talented individuals at the business being acquired will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will be able to continue to successfully manage or have adequate resources to successfully operate any acquired business. in addition, certain of our acquired dialysis centers and facilities have been in service for many years, which may result in a higher level of maintenance costs. further, our facilities, equipment and information technology may need to be improved or renovated to maintain or increase operational efficiency, compete for patients and medical directors, or meet changing regulatory requirements. increases in maintenance costs and/or capital expenditures could have, under certain circumstances, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we originally estimated, and may have other issues, including, without limitation, those related to internal controls over financial reporting or issues that could affect our ability to comply with healthcare laws and regulations and other laws applicable to our expanded business, which could harm our reputation. as a result, we cannot make any assurances that the acquisitions we consummate will be successful. although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. in addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits, the amounts held in escrow for our benefit (if any), or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. in the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification or alternative remedies that might be available to us, or any applicable insurance, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation.
in addition, under the terms of the equity purchase agreement for the dmg sale (the dmg sale agreement), we agreed to certain indemnification obligations, including with respect to claims for breaches of our representations and warranties regarding compliance with law, litigation, absence of undisclosed liabilities, employee benefit matters, labor matters, or taxes, among others, and other claims for which we provided the buyer with a special indemnity. as a result, we may become obligated to make payments to the buyer relating to our previous ownership and operation of the dmg business. any such post-closing liabilities and required payments under the dmg sale agreement, or otherwise, or in connection with any other past or future disposition of material assets or businesses could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation.
additionally, joint ventures, including, without limitation, our asia pacific joint venture, and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. in addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management may require us to make capital contributions or necessitate other payments, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, result in reputational harm to us or adversely affect the value of our investment or partnership, among other things. in addition, we have potential obligations to purchase the interests held by third parties in many of our joint ventures as a result of put provisions that are exercisable at the third party's discretion within specified time periods, pursuant to the applicable agreement. if these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third party owner's equity interest, generally at the appraised market value. there can be no assurances that these joint ventures and/or minority investments, including, without limitation, our asia pacific joint venture, ultimately will be successful.
if certain of our suppliers do not meet our needs, if there are material price increases on supplies, if we are not reimbursed or adequately reimbursed for drugs we purchase or if we are unable to effectively access new technology or superior products, it could negatively impact our ability to effectively provide the services we offer and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we have significant suppliers, with a substantial portion of our total vendor spend concentrated with a limited number of third party suppliers. these third party suppliers include, without limitation, suppliers of pharmaceuticals that may be the primary source of products critical to the services we provide, or to which we have committed obligations to make purchases, sometimes at particular prices. if any of these suppliers do not meet our needs for the products they supply, including, without limitation, in the event of a product recall, shortage or dispute, and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources, if we experience material price increases from these suppliers that we are unable to mitigate, or if some of the drugs that we purchase from our suppliers are not reimbursed or not adequately reimbursed by commercial or government payors, or if we are unable to secure products, including pharmaceuticals at competitive rates and within the desired time frame, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, the technology related to the products critical to the services we provide is subject to new developments which may result in superior products. if we are not able to access superior products on a cost-effective basis, either due to competitive conditions in the marketplace or otherwise, or if suppliers are not able to fulfill our requirements for such products, we could face patient attrition and other negative consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
expansion of our operations to and offering our services in markets outside of the u.s. subjects us to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.
we are continuing to expand our operations by offering our services and entering new lines of business in certain markets outside of the u.s., which increases our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets. depending on the market, these risks include those relating to:
•changes in the local economic environment;
•political instability, armed conflicts or terrorism;
•public health crises, such as pandemics or epidemics, including the covid-19 pandemic;
•social changes;
•intellectual property legal protections and remedies;
•trade regulations;
•procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services;
•foreign currency;
•additional u.s. and foreign taxes;
•export controls;
•antitrust and competition laws and regulations;
•lack of reliable legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights;
•changes in local laws or regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof;
•potentially longer ramp-up times for starting up new operations and for payment and collection cycles;
•financial and operational, and information technology systems integration;
•failure to comply with u.s. laws, such as the fcpa, or local laws that prohibit us, our partners, or our partners' or our agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials or any third party for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business; and
•data and privacy restrictions.
issues relating to the failure to comply with applicable non-u.s. laws, requirements or restrictions may also impact our domestic business and/or raise scrutiny on our domestic practices.
additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international business and operations will be different than those affecting our domestic business and operations. for example, conducting international operations requires us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, to comply with local laws and regulations, including to fulfill financial reporting and records retention requirements among other things, and to overcome the numerous new challenges inherent in managing international operations, including, without limitation, challenges based on differing languages and cultures, challenges related to establishing clinical operations in differing regulatory and compliance environments, and challenges related to the timely hiring, integration and retention of a sufficient number of skilled personnel to carry out operations in an environment with which we are not familiar.
any expansion of our international operations through acquisitions or through organic growth could increase these risks. additionally, while we may invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, including to start up or acquire new operations, we may not be able to operate them profitably on the anticipated timeline, or at all.
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and could materially harm our reputation.
if our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation.
as of december 31, 2020, we owned a controlling interest in numerous dialysis-related joint ventures, which represented approximately 27% of our u.s. dialysis revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020. in addition, we also owned noncontrolling equity investments in several other dialysis related joint ventures. we expect to continue to increase the number of our joint ventures. many of our joint ventures with physicians or physician groups also have certain physician owners providing medical director services to centers we own and operate. because our relationships with physicians are governed by the federal and state anti-kickback statutes, we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to satisfy as many federal safe harbor requirements as we believe are commercially reasonable. our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all of the elements of any safe harbor under the federal anti-kickback statute, however, and therefore are susceptible to government scrutiny. additionally, our joint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. if our joint ventures are found to violate applicable laws or regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation. for additional information on these risks, see the risk factors under the headings "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation" and "we may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions, which may materially affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of our business, and, under certain circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation."
there are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of dialysis revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize, and if our estimates of revenues and related refund liabilities are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
there are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize in a reporting period. the billing and collection process is complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage and other payor issues, such as ensuring appropriate documentation. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for approximately 204,200 u.s. patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payors. revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary government payor that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage, the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. we generally expect our range of u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of net revenues for the segment. if our estimates of u.s. dialysis net patient services revenues and related refund liabilities are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including, without limitation, our international operations, that we operate or invest in now or in the future may generate losses and may ultimately be unsuccessful. in the event that one or more of these activities is unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted and we may have to write off our investment and incur other exit costs.
our ancillary services and strategic initiatives are subject to many of the same risks, regulations and laws, as described in the risk factors related to our dialysis business set forth in this part i, item 1a, and are also subject to additional risks, regulations and laws specific to the nature of the particular strategic initiative. we expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include healthcare services not related to dialysis. many of these initiatives require or would require investments of both management and financial resources and can generate significant losses for a substantial period of time and may not become profitable in the expected timeframe or at all. there can be no assurance that any such strategic initiative will ultimately be successful. any significant change in market conditions or business performance, including, without limitation, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, or in the political, legislative or regulatory environment, may impact the performance or economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives.
if any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives, including our international operations, are unsuccessful, it would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and we may determine to exit that line of business. we could incur significant termination costs if we were to exit certain of these lines of business. in addition, we may incur a material write-off or an impairment of our investment, including, without limitation, goodwill or other assets, in one or more of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives. in that regard, we have taken, and may in the future take, impairment and restructuring charges in addition to those described above related to our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including, without limitation, in our international and pharmacy businesses.
if a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to law, rule or regulation, new competition, a perceived decrease in the quality of service levels at our centers or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
physicians, including medical directors, choose where they refer their patients. some physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical director of the center. as a result, referral sources for many of our centers include the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center.
our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally ten years, and at any given time a large number of them could be up for renewal at the same time. medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us and, under certain circumstances, our former medical directors may choose to provide medical director services for competing providers or establish their own dialysis centers in competition with ours. neither our current nor former medical directors have an obligation to refer their patients to our centers. in addition, there are a number of new entrants into the dialysis space, and physicians, including medical directors, may refer patients to these new entrants rather than the company.
the aging of the nephrologist population and opportunities presented by our competitors may negatively impact a medical director's decision to enter into or extend his or her agreement with us. moreover, a perceived decrease in the quality of service levels at our centers or different affiliation models in the changing healthcare environment that limit a nephrologist's choice in where he or she can refer patients, such as an increase in the number of physicians becoming employed by hospitals, may limit a nephrologist's ability or desire to refer patients to our centers or otherwise negatively impact treatment volumes.
in addition, if the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, there can be no assurances that we would be successful in restructuring the relationship, which would lead to the early termination of the agreement. if we are unable to obtain qualified medical directors to provide supervision of the operations and care provided at our dialysis centers, it could affect physicians' desire to refer patients to our dialysis centers. if a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
if our labor costs continue to rise, including due to shortages, changes in certification requirements and/or higher than normal turnover rates in skilled clinical personnel; or currently pending or future governmental laws, rules, regulations or initiatives impose additional requirements or limitations on our operations or profitability; or, if we are unable to attract and retain key leadership talent, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we face increasing labor costs generally, and in particular, we continue to face increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel that has been exacerbated by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased labor costs and experience staffing challenges related to covid-19 while the pandemic persists, the extent of which will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic, among other things. for additional discussion of the risks facing us related to covid-19, see the risk factor under the heading "we face various risks related to the dynamic and evolving novel coronavirus pandemic, any of which may have a material adverse impact on us." we compete for nurses with hospitals and other healthcare providers. this nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. furthermore, changes in certification requirements can impact our ability to maintain sufficient staff levels, including to the extent our teammates are not able to meet new requirements, among other things. in addition, if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for our skilled clinical personnel, our operations and treatment growth may be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we also face competition in attracting and retaining talent for key leadership positions. if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals, we may experience disruptions in our business operations, including, without limitation, our ability to achieve strategic goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for additional information on these risks, see the risk factors under the headings "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation;" and "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
our business is labor intensive and could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain employees or if union organizing activities or legislative or other changes result in significant increases in our operating costs or decreases in productivity.
our business is labor intensive, and our financial and operating results have been and continue to be subject to variations in labor-related costs, productivity and the number of pending or potential claims against us related to labor and employment practices. political or other efforts at the national or local level could result in actions or proposals that increase the likelihood of success of union organizing activities at our facilities and ongoing union organizing activities at our facilities could continue or increase for other reasons. we could experience an upward trend in wages and benefits and labor and employment claims, including, without limitation, the filing of class action suits, or adverse outcomes of such claims, or face work stoppages. in addition, we are and may continue to be subject to targeted corporate campaigns by union organizers in response to which we have been and may continue to be required to expend substantial resources, both time and financial. any of these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our employee relations, treatment growth, productivity, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
failing to effectively maintain, operate or upgrade our information systems or those of third-party service providers upon which we rely, including, without limitation, our clinical, billing and collections systems could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our business depends significantly on effective information systems. our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, upgrade and enhance existing systems and develop or contract for new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, emerging cybersecurity risks and threats, evolving industry, legal and regulatory standards and requirements, new models of care, and other changes in our business, among other things. for example, the provisions related to data interoperability, information blocking, and patient access in the cures act include, among other things, changes to the office of the national coordinator for health information technology's (onc's) health it certification program and requirements that cms-regulated payors make relevant claims/care data and provider directory information available through standardized patient access and provider directory application programming interfaces (apis) that connect to provider electronic health records. we have made and continue to make investments in building data interoperability capabilities, including as part of building on our integrated care capabilities as noted above, and continue to evaluate the potential impact of the cms and onc final rules. any failure to adequately comply with these rules may adversely impact our medicare business, our ability to scale our integrated care business and our ability to compete with certain smaller and/or non-traditional providers taking advantage of an asymmetrical environment with respect to data and/or regulatory requirements given our status as an esrd service provider. there can be no assurances that the implementation of planned enhancements to our systems, such as our implementation of these data interoperability provisions or our other efforts that are currently ongoing to upgrade and better integrate our clinical systems, will be successful or that we will ultimately realize anticipated benefits from investments in new or existing information systems. in addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related support, technology or other services from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable if such third parties fail to perform adequately.
failure to successfully implement, operate and maintain effective and efficient information systems with adequate technological capabilities, deficiencies or defects in the systems and related technology, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could result in competitive disadvantages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for additional information on the risks we face in a highly competitive market, see the risk factor under the heading, "if we are unable to compete successfully, including, without limitation, implementing our growth strategy and/or retaining patients and physicians willing to serve as medical directors, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." if the information we rely upon to run our business was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we or third parties on which we rely fail to adequately maintain information systems and data integrity effectively, whether due to software deficiencies, human coding or implementation error or otherwise, we could experience difficulty meeting clinical outcome goals, face regulatory problems, including sanctions and penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could be material. moreover, failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems (including our networks) and data, or information systems and data hosted by third parties upon which we rely, could subject us to severe consequences as described in the risk factor under the heading "privacy and information security laws are complex, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems or defend against cybersecurity attacks, we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches or suffer losses to our data and information technology assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or materially harm our reputation."
our billing system, among others, is critical to our billing operations. if there are defects in the billing system, or billing systems or services of third parties upon which we rely, we may experience difficulties in our ability to successfully bill and collect for services rendered, including, without limitation, a delay in collections, a reduction in the amounts collected, increased risk of retractions from and refunds to commercial and government payors, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and noncompliance with reimbursement laws and related requirements, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
in the clinical environment, a failure of our clinical systems, or the systems of our third-party service providers, to operate effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, the clinical care provided to patients, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for example, in connection with claims for which at least part of the government's payments to us is based on clinical performance or patient outcomes or co-morbidities, if relevant clinical systems fail to accurately capture the data we report to cms or we otherwise have data integrity issues with respect to the reported information, this could impact our payments from government payors as well as our ability to retain funds paid to us based on the inaccurate information.
additionally, we expect the highly competitive environment in which we operate to become increasingly more competitive as the market evolves and new technologies are introduced. this dynamic environment requires continuous investment in new technologies and clinical applications. machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly driving innovations in technology, and parts of our operations may employ robotics. if these technologies or applications fail to operate as anticipated or do not perform as specified, including due to potential design defects and defects in the development of algorithms or other technologies, human error or otherwise, our clinical operations, business and reputation may be harmed. if we are unable to successfully maintain, enhance or operate our information systems, including through the implementation of such technologies or applications in our clinical operations and laboratory, we may be, among other things, unable to efficiently adapt to evolving laws and requirements, unable to remain competitive with others who successfully implement and advance this technology, subject to increased risk under existing laws, regulations and requirements that apply to our business, and our patients' safety may be adversely impacted, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could materially harm our reputation. for additional detail, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation."
general risk factors the level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business, and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes and our ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants depends on many factors beyond our control.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase authorization discussed under "stock repurchases" in part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." as described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, we are party to a senior secured credit agreement (the credit agreement), which consists of a secured term loan a facility, a secured term loan b-1 facility and a secured revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of $1 billion. our long-term indebtedness also includes $3.250 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes.
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes, it could, for example:
•make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt;
•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, repurchases of stock at the levels intended or announced, or at all, and other general corporate purposes;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;
•expose us to interest rate volatility that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and our ability to service our indebtedness;
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and
•limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to refinance existing debt on favorable terms when otherwise available or at all.
our senior secured credit facilities bear, and other indebtedness we may incur in the future may bear, interest at a variable rate. as a result, at any given time interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities and any other variable rate debt could be higher or lower than current levels. if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and therefore net income and associated cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.
our indebtedness levels and the required payments on such indebtedness may also be impacted by expected reforms related to libor. the variable interest rates payable under our senior secured credit facilities are linked to libor as the benchmark for establishing such rates. the libor benchmark has been the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and reform proposals. the reforms may cause libor to perform differently from the past and libor may ultimately cease to exist after 2023. the u.s. federal reserve, in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee, a steering committee comprised of, among other entities, large u.s. financial institutions, is considering replacing u.s. dollar libor with a new index that measures the cost of borrowing cash overnight, backed by u.s. treasury securities (sofr). whether or not sofr or any other potential alternative reference rate attains market traction as a libor replacement rate remains in question. our senior secured credit facilities include mechanics to facilitate the adoption by us and our lenders of an alternative benchmark rate for use in place of libor; however, no assurance can be made that we and our lenders will agree on such an alternative rate and, even if agreed upon, such alternative rate may not perform in a manner similar to libor and may result in interest rates that are higher or lower than those that would have resulted had libor remained in effect.
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, including, without limitation, any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, to repurchase our stock at the levels intended or announced and to meet our other liquidity needs, will depend on our ability to generate cash. this depends not only on the success of our business but is also subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. we cannot provide assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our working capital and other liquidity needs, including those described above. if we are unable to generate sufficient funds to service our outstanding indebtedness or to meet our working capital or other liquidity needs, including those described above, we would be required to refinance, restructure, or otherwise amend some or all of such indebtedness, sell assets, change or reduce our intended or announced uses or strategy for capital deployment, including, without limitation, for stock repurchases, reduce capital expenditures, planned expansions or other strategic initiatives, or raise additional cash through the sale of our equity or equity-related securities. we cannot make any assurances that any such refinancing, restructurings, amendments, sales of assets, or issuances of equity or equity-related securities can be accomplished or, if accomplished, will be on favorable terms or would raise sufficient funds to meet these obligations or our other liquidity needs.
in addition, we may continue to incur indebtedness in the future, and the amount of that additional indebtedness may be substantial. although the credit agreement includes covenants that could limit our indebtedness, we currently have, and expect to continue to have, the ability to incur substantial additional debt. the risks described in this risk factor could intensify as new debt is added to current debt levels or if we incur any new debt obligations that subject us to restrictive covenants that limit our financial and operational flexibility. any breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness.
any failure to pay any of our indebtedness when due or any other default under our credit facilities or our other indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could trigger cross default or cross acceleration provisions in our other debt instruments, thereby permitting the holders of that other indebtedness to demand immediate repayment or cease to make future extensions of credit, and, in the case of secured indebtedness, to take possession of and sell the collateral securing such indebtedness to satisfy our obligations.
the borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and senior indentures are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our and certain of our domestic subsidiaries' assets. such guarantees and the fact that we have pledged such assets may make it more difficult and expensive for us to make, or under certain circumstances could effectively prevent us from making, additional secured and unsecured borrowings.
we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.
we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the u.s. federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. as the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable or favorable change in our overall tax provision.
changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the u.s. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for example, changes to the political environment related to the most recent u.s. election cycle increase the likelihood that changes in taxation and related regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our patients, business partners and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to material penalties and liabilities. we are regularly subject to audits by various tax authorities. for example, our current audits include an audit by the internal revenue service for the years 2014-2017, and it is possible that the final determination of this and any other tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. any changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse development or outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses that are not covered by insurance or exceed our existing insurance coverage that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and could materially harm our reputation.
our operations and how we manage our business may subject us, as well as our officers and directors to whom we owe certain defense and indemnity obligations, to litigation and liability. our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope or limits of coverage of any applicable insurance coverage, including, without limitation, claims related to adverse patient events, cybersecurity incidents, contractual disputes, antitrust and competition laws and regulations, professional and general liability and directors' and officers' duties. in addition, we have received notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties, as well as subpoenas and cids from the federal government, related to our business practices, including, without limitation, our historical billing practices and the historical billing practices of acquired businesses. although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, an adverse result with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially harm our reputation. we maintain insurance coverage for those risks we deem are appropriate to insure against and make determinations about whether to self-insure as to other risks or layers of coverage. however, a successful claim, including, without limitation, a professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim or a claim related to a cybersecurity incident, which is in excess of any applicable insurance coverage, that is outside the scope or limits of any applicable insurance coverage, or that is subject to our self-insurance retentions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.
in addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following:
•the collapse or insolvency of our insurance carriers;
•further increases in premiums and deductibles;
•increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims;
•obtaining insurance with exclusions for things such as communicable diseases; or
•an inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.
if we fail to successfully maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, the integrity of our financial reporting could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results, the market's perception of our business and our stock price.
the integration of acquisitions and addition of new business lines into our internal control over financial reporting has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and has increased, and is expected to continue to increase our compliance costs. failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results, the market's perception of our business and our stock price. in addition, we could be required to restate our financial results in the event of a significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting or in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles.
deterioration in economic conditions, disruptions in the financial markets or the effects of natural or other disasters, political instability, public health crises or adverse weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires or flooding could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
deterioration in economic conditions, whether in connection with the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. among other things, the potential decline in federal and state revenues that may result from such conditions may create additional pressures to contain or reduce reimbursements for our services from medicare, medicaid and other government sponsored programs. increases in job losses in the u.s. as a result of adverse economic conditions, including economic deterioration due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, could result in a smaller percentage of our patients being covered by an employer group health plan and a larger percentage being covered by lower paying medicare and medicaid programs. employers may also select more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates. to the extent that payors are negatively impacted by a decline in the economy, we may experience further pressure on commercial rates, a slowdown in collections and a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect. in addition, uncertainty in the financial markets could adversely affect the variable interest rates payable under our credit facilities or could make it more difficult to obtain or renew such facilities or to obtain other forms of financing in the future, if at all. for additional information regarding the risks presented by the covid-19 pandemic, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "we face various risks related to the dynamic and evolving novel coronavirus pandemic, any of which may have a material adverse impact on us." for additional information regarding the risks related to our indebtedness, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "the level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business, and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes and our ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants depends on many factors beyond our control."
moreover, as of december 31, 2020, we had approximately $6.919 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. we account for impairments of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance, and record impairment charges when and to the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to exceed its estimated fair value. we use a variety of factors to assess changes in the financial condition, future prospects and other circumstances concerning our businesses and to estimate their fair value when applicable. these assessments and the related valuations can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement.
should our revenues and financial results be materially, unfavorably impacted due to, among other things, a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states that negatively impacts reimbursement rates or the availability of insurance coverage for our patients, we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.
further, some of our operations, including our clinical laboratory, dialysis centers and other facilities, may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural or other disasters, political instability, public health crises such as global pandemics or epidemics, including the covid-19 pandemic, or adverse weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires or flooding. each of these effects and risks may be further intensified by the increasing impact of climate change on a global scale. in addition, these risks are particularly heightened for our patients in part because individuals with chronic illness may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of epidemics or other public health crises and also because any natural or other disaster, political instability or adverse weather event that disrupts or limits the operation of any of our centers or other facilities or services may delay or otherwise impact the critical services we provide to dialysis patients. further, any such event or other occurrence that results in a failure of the fitness of our clinical laboratory, dialysis centers and related operations and/or other facilities or otherwise adversely impacts the safety of our teammates or patients at any of those locations could lead us to face adverse consequences, including, without limitation, the potential loss of data, including phi or pii, compliance or regulatory investigations, any of which could materially impact our business, results of operation and financial condition, and could materially harm our reputation. for example, our clinical laboratory is located in florida, a state that has in the past experienced and may in the future experience hurricanes. natural or other disasters or adverse weather events could significantly damage or destroy our facilities, disrupt operations, increase our costs to maintain operations and require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations. in addition, as the effects of climate change progressively surface, such as through potential increases in the frequency and intensity of natural or other disasters or adverse weather events or through laws or regulations adopted in response, we may face increased costs associated with operating our clinics, including, without limitation, with respect to supplies of water or energy costs.
our presence in markets outside the u.s. may increase our exposure to these and similar risks related to natural disasters, public health crises, political instability, climate change or other catastrophic events outside our control. for additional information regarding the risks related to our international business, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "expansion of our operations to and offering our services in markets outside of the u.s. subjects us to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation."
any or all of these factors, as well as other consequences of these events, none of which we can currently predict, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or materially harm our reputation.
provisions in our organizational documents, our compensation programs and policies and certain requirements under delaware law may deter changes of control and may make it more difficult for our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and take other corporate actions that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests.
our organizational documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. these include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent, advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals and granting our board of directors the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval.
most of our outstanding employee stock-based compensation awards include a provision accelerating the vesting of the awards in the event of a change of control. these and any other change of control provisions may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay for our company.
we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law that, subject to exceptions, prohibits us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder.
the provisions described above may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive. these provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and as such are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for "forward-looking statements" provided by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements could include, among other things, davita's response to and the expected future impacts of the novel coronavirus (covid-19), including statements about our balance sheet and liquidity, our expenses and expense offsets, revenues, billings and collections, potential need, ability or willingness to use any funds under government relief programs, availability or cost of supplies, treatment volumes, mix expectation, such as the percentage or number of patients under commercial insurance, the availability and administration of covid-19 vaccines, and overall impact on our patients and teammates, as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, expenses, strategic initiatives, government and commercial payment rates, expectations related to value-based care and medicare advantage plan enrollment and our ongoing stock repurchase program. all statements in this report, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. without limiting the foregoing, statements including the words "expect," "intend," "will," "could," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "forecast," "guidance," "outlook," "goals," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are based on davita's current expectations and are based solely on information available as of the date of this report. davita undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changed circumstances, new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. actual future events and results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, among other things:
•the continuing impact of the dynamic and evolving covid-19 pandemic, including, without limitation, on our patients, teammates, physician partners, suppliers, business, operations, reputation, financial condition and results of operations; the government's response to the covid-19 pandemic; the availability, acceptance, impact and efficacy of covid-19 treatments, therapies and vaccines; further spread or resurgence of the virus, including as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus; the continuing impact of the pandemic on our revenue and non-acquired growth due to lower treatment volumes; the consequences of an extended economic downturn resulting from the impacts of covid-19, such as a potential negative impact on our commercial mix, which may persist even after the pandemic subsides; and continuing covid-19-related costs, such as costs to procure equipment and clinical supplies and higher salary and wage expense. the aforementioned risks and uncertainties may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties discussed below;
•the concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number or percentage of our patients under such plans, including, without limitation, as a result of restrictions or prohibitions on the use and/or availability of charitable premium assistance, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients, or our making incorrect assumptions about how our patients will respond to any change in financial assistance from charitable organizations;
•noncompliance by us or our business associates with any privacy or security laws or any security breach by us or a third party involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information;
•the extent to which the ongoing implementation of healthcare reform, or changes in or new legislation, regulations or guidance, enforcement thereof or related litigation result in a reduction in coverage or reimbursement rates for our services, a reduction in the number of patients enrolled in higher-paying commercial plans or that are enrolled in or select medicare advantage plans or other material impacts to our business; or our making incorrect assumptions about how our patients will respond to any such developments;
•a reduction in government payment rates under the medicare end stage renal disease program or other government-based programs and the impact of the medicare advantage benchmark structure;
•risks arising from potential changes in laws, regulations or requirements applicable to us, such as potential and proposed federal and/or state legislation, regulation, ballot, executive action or other initiatives, including those related to healthcare and/or labor matters, such as ab 290 in california;
•the impact of the political environment and related developments on the current healthcare marketplace and on our business, including with respect to the future of the affordable care act, the exchanges and many other core aspects of the current healthcare marketplace, as well as the composition of the u.s. supreme court and the new presidential administration and congressional majority;
•our ability to successfully implement our strategies with respect to home-based dialysis, value-based care and/or integrated kidney care, including maintaining our existing business and further developing our capabilities in a complex and highly regulated environment;
•changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, reimbursement and payment policies and processes, or pharmaceutical pricing, including with respect to hypoxia inducible factors;
•legal and compliance risks, such as our continued compliance with complex government regulations;
•continued increased competition from dialysis providers and others, and other potential marketplace changes;
•our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates, such as accountable care organizations, independent practice associations and integrated delivery systems;
•our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might announce or be considering, on terms favorable to us or at all, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, or to successfully expand our operations and services in markets outside the united states, or to businesses outside of dialysis;
•the variability of our cash flows, including without limitation any extended billing or collections cycles; the risk that we may not be able to generate or access sufficient cash in the future to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; and the risk that we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, on terms favorable to us or at all;
•factors that may impact our ability to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and the timing of any such stock repurchases, as well as our use of a considerable amount of available funds to repurchase stock;
•risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements;
•impairment of our goodwill, investments or other assets; and
•uncertainties associated with the other risk factors set forth in part i, item 1a. of this annual report on form 10-k, and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in any subsequent reports that we file or furnish with the sec from time to time.
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.
company overview our principal business is to provide dialysis and related lab services to patients in the united states, which we refer to as our u.s. dialysis business. we also operate various ancillary services and strategic initiatives including our international operations, which we collectively refer to as our ancillary services, as well as our corporate administrative support. our u.s. dialysis business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the u.s. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end stage renal disease (esrd) or end stage kidney disease (eskd).
on june 19, 2019, we completed the sale of our davita medical group (dmg) business to collaborative care holdings, llc, a subsidiary of unitedhealth group inc. as a result of this transaction, dmg's results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and dmg is not included below in this management's discussion and analysis.
notwithstanding the challenges of responding to the novel coronavirus pandemic (covid-19), our year-over-year overall financial performance in 2020 benefited from increased revenue, which was primarily due to higher average revenue per treatment in our u.s. dialysis business as well as acquired growth in our international business. this was partially offset by increases in labor costs (both operating and overhead), lower margin on calcimimetics, increases in advocacy costs, and increased costs driven by the emergence of covid-19, including increased costs related to compensation and medical supplies.
drivers of our financial performance in 2020 included the following:
•improved key clinical outcomes in our u.s. dialysis business, including our recognition as an industry leader for the eighth consecutive year in cms' quality incentive program and for the last seven years under the cms five-star quality rating system;
•revenue growth of 0.9% in u.s. dialysis, 5.3% in u.s. ancillary services, and 11.0% in international operations;
•a net increase of 63 u.s. and 62 international dialysis centers, including entering a new country, the united kingdom;
•operating cash flows of $1.979 billion from continuing operations;
•repurchase of 16,477,378 shares of our common stock for aggregate consideration of $1.447 billion, and reduction of our share count by 12.6% year-over-year;

in 2021, we expect that covid-19 will continue to impact our business and financial performance, as described in further detail below, though the magnitude of these impacts remains difficult to predict and subject to significant uncertainty due to a number of factors, including, among others, the severity and duration of the pandemic; further spread or resurgence of the virus, including as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus; its impact on the ckd patient population and our patient population; the availability, acceptance, impact and efficacy of covid-19 treatments, therapies and vaccines; the pandemics' continuing impact on the u.s. and global economies and unemployment; the responses of our competitors to the pandemic and related changes in the marketplace; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local government responses. the continued impacts and disruptions to our business as a result of the covid-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our patients, teammates, physician partners, suppliers, business, operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or liquidity. on treatment volume, we continue to face pressure primarily driven by the impact of covid-19 on mortality rates for dialysis patients. this pressure is also influenced by slowing industry growth and competitive activity. on reimbursement rate, we expect modest growth in aggregate, primarily due to the expected net market basket update for medicare treatments as well as an increase in medicare advantage enrollment due to the 21st century cures act, partially offset by the scheduled resumption of medicare sequestration in 2021. on cost, we continue to expect inflationary pressure on wage rates and other costs, partially offset by continued savings on pharmaceutical costs. we expect to incur significantly less advocacy costs in 2021 than we experienced in 2020. we also expect to continue making investments to expand our ability to offer home-based dialysis service options and further advance our integrated care and value-based care initiatives in 2021. finally, the timing and scope of any potential changes to the regulatory landscape remain uncertain, particularly in light of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and the incoming new federal administration, and as such, considerable uncertainty exists surrounding the continued development of the various governmental laws, regulations and other requirements that impact our business.
the discussion below includes analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019. our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019, includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018, in its part ii item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations".
references to the "notes" in the discussion below refer to the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k at item 15, "exhibits, financial statement schedules" as referred from part ii item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
covid-19 and its impact on our business as noted above and described in further detail in part i item 1, "business," we continue to closely monitor the impact on our business of the pandemic and the resulting economic environment, including the impact on our patients, teammates, physician partners, suppliers, vendors and business partners. we have dedicated and continue to dedicate substantial resources in response to covid-19, to help safely maintain continuity of care for our patients throughout this crisis, whether in the hospital, outpatient or home setting, and to help protect our caregivers. our covid-19 response has included, among other things, the implementation of additional protocols and operational initiatives related to infection control and clinical best practices, redistribution of resources across geographies and increased investment in and utilization of telehealth capabilities. we also have maintained business process continuity during the pandemic by enabling most back office teammates to work remotely and implemented guidance early in the pandemic to help mitigate health and safety risks to our teammates imposed by covid-19. our response protocol generally has allowed us to maintain continuity of care for our patients and we carefully monitor the efficacy of these protocols and their impact on our operations and strategic initiatives as the pandemic continues.
due in part to the protocols and initiatives described above, we incurred significant costs related to covid-19 in 2020, and we expect to continue to incur extended and significant additional costs in connection with our response to covid-19. for example, we have had, and expect to continue to have, increased costs associated with a high demand for our skilled clinical personnel. additionally, the steps we have taken designed to help safely maintain continuity of care for our patients and help protect our caregivers, such as our policies to implement dedicated care shifts for patients with confirmed or suspected covid-19 and other enhanced clinical practices, have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, our expenses and use of personal protective equipment (ppe). our response to covid-19 also has resulted in higher salary and wage expense, and we have provided, and may provide in the future, substantial financial support associated with relief reimbursement to our teammates. furthermore, the effort and cost needed to procure certain of our equipment and clinical supplies, including ppe, have increased, and we expect that these increased costs will continue while the pandemic persists. however, our covid-19 response reduced certain other expenses in 2020, such as those related to teammate travel, though it remains uncertain how much of these reductions, if any, will persist after the pandemic subsides.
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience a negative impact on revenue and non-acquired growth from covid-19 due to lower treatment volumes, including from the negative impact on our patient census that is the result of changes in rates of mortality. because esrd patients may be older and generally have comorbidities, several of which are risk factors for covid-19, we believe the mortality rate of infected patients is, and will continue to be, higher in the dialysis population than in the general population, and covid-19 also could impact the ckd population differently. over the longer term, we believe that changes in mortality in both the ckd and esrd populations due to covid-19 will depend primarily on the infection rate, case fatality rate, the age and health status of affected patients, the access to and efficacy of vaccinations as well as willingness to be vaccinated. we expect that these changes are likely to continue to negatively impact our revenue and non-acquired growth even as the pandemic subsides. however, determining the extent to which these impacts should be directly attributable to covid-19 is difficult due to testing and reporting limitations, and other factors that may drive treatment volumes and new admissions over time, such as the number of transplants or deferred admissions. the magnitude of these cumulative impacts has been substantial, and depending on the ultimate severity and duration of the pandemic, could be material.
in addition, the covid-19 pandemic and efforts to contain the virus have led to global economic deterioration and rapid and sharp increases in unemployment levels, which ultimately could result in a materially reduced share of our patients being covered by commercial insurance plans, with more patients being covered by lower-paying government insurance programs or being uninsured. these effects may persist after the pandemic subsides as, among other things, our patients could experience permanent changes in their insurance coverage as a result of changes to their employment status. in the event such a material reduction occurs in the share of our patients covered by commercial insurance plans, it would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the extent of these effects will be dependent upon, among other things, the extent and duration of the increased unemployment levels for our patient population, economic deterioration and potential recession; the timing and scope of federal, state and local governmental responses to the ongoing pandemic; and patients' ability to retain existing insurance and their individual choices with respect to their coverage. despite the broader economic conditions in the u.s. in 2020, our commercial mix in 2020 was relatively flat as compared to our commercial mix in 2019, which we believe was largely due to the fact that older, higher-risk patients who tend to disproportionately have government health insurance coverage, have been more adversely impacted by covid-19 to date, but the ultimate impact of covid-19 on our commercial mix will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
the government response to covid-19 has been wide-ranging and will continue to develop over time, particularly in light of the new federal administration. as a result, we may not be able to accurately predict the nature, timing or extent of the impact of such changes on the markets in which we conduct business or on the other participants that operate in those markets, or any potential changes to the extensive set of federal, state and local laws, regulations and requirements that govern our business. we have worked with certain government agencies to respond to the covid-19 pandemic, and in certain cases have sought waivers of regulatory requirements. we also are working to help make covid-19 vaccines available to our patients and teammates, including through coordination with state and federal governments on direct vaccine distribution so that we can administer vaccines to our patients and teammates. these vaccines are currently available under emergency use authorizations, and there can be no assurance that our patients and caregivers will choose to receive a covid-19 vaccine or that the vaccines will prove to be as safe and effective as currently understood by the scientific community. in addition, we may encounter difficulties with the availability and storage of the vaccines, or experience other complications related to administering the vaccines, some of which have multiple dose requirements. we operate in a complex and highly regulated environment, and the novel nature of our covid-19 response, including, for example, with respect to regulatory waivers and our administration of the newly developed covid-19 vaccines, may increase our exposure to legal, regulatory and clinical risks.
furthermore, a significant initial part of the federal government response to the covid-19 pandemic was the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security (cares) act, a $2 trillion economic stimulus package that was signed into law on march 27, 2020. the cares act included a provision that suspended the 2% medicare sequestration from may 1, 2020 through december 31, 2020, and in the year ended december 31, 2020 our revenues increased due to this suspension as further described below. the consolidated appropriations act 2021, signed into law on december 27, 2020, extended the suspension of the 2% medicare sequestration until march 31, 2021. while in effect, this legislation has increased, and will continue to increase our revenues. in addition, the cares act authorized $100 billion in funding to be distributed to healthcare providers through the federal public health and social services emergency fund (provider relief fund). while we declined approximately $250 million of government funding received in the second quarter of 2020 from the provider relief fund, certain of our competitors accepted such funds. there can be no assurance that financial or other assistance will be available from the government if we have a need for such assistance in the future.
we believe the ultimate impact of this public health crisis on the company will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including among other things the severity and duration of the pandemic; further spread or resurgence of the virus including as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus; its impact on the ckd patient population and our patient population; the availability, acceptance, impact and efficacy of covid-19 treatments, therapies and vaccines; the pandemic's continuing impact on the u.s. and global economies and unemployment; the responses of our competitors to the pandemic and related changes in the marketplace; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses. at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate impact the covid-19 pandemic will have on us, but the adverse impact could be material.

u.s. dialysis business our u.s. dialysis business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services, operating 2,816 outpatient dialysis centers and serving a total of approximately 204,200 patients. we also provide hospital inpatient dialysis services in approximately 900 hospitals. we estimate that we have approximately a 36% share of the u.s. dialysis market based upon the number of patients we serve.
approximately 91% of our 2020 consolidated revenues were derived directly from our u.s. dialysis business. the principal drivers of our u.s. dialysis revenues include    :
•our number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three in-center treatments per week as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis; and
•our average dialysis patient service revenue per treatment, including the mix of patients with commercial plans and government programs as primary payor.
within our u.s. dialysis business, our home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services are operationally integrated with our outpatient dialysis centers and related laboratory services. our outpatient, home-based, and hospital inpatient dialysis services comprise approximately 77%, 17% and 6% of our u.s. dialysis revenues, respectively.
in the u.s., government dialysis-related payment rates are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy. for 2020, approximately 68% of our total u.s. dialysis patient services revenues were generated from government-based programs for services to approximately 90% of our total u.s. patients. these government-based programs are principally medicare and medicare advantage, medicaid and managed medicaid plans, and other government plans, representing approximately 57%, 7% and 4% of our u.s. dialysis patient services revenues, respectively.
dialysis payment rates from commercial payors vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients in relation to total patients represents a significant driver of our total average dialysis patient service revenue per treatment. commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) represent approximately 32% of u.s. dialysis patient services revenues.
for discussion of government reimbursement, the medicare esrd bundled payment system, medicare advantage and commercial reimbursement, see the discussion in part i. item 1. business under the heading "u.s. dialysis business - sources of revenue-concentrations and risks." for a discussion of operational, clinical and financial risks and uncertainties that we face in connection with the medicare esrd bundled payment system, see the risk factor in part i. item 1a. risk factors under the heading "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation" for a discussion of operational, clinical and financial risks and uncertainties that we face in connection with commercial payors, see the risk factors in item 1a. risk factors under the headings "we continuously have ongoing negotiations with commercial payors, and if the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or if we are unable to maintain contracts with payors with competitive terms, including, without limitation, reimbursement rates, scope and duration of coverage and in-network benefits, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows"; and "if the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
effective january 1, 2018, both oral and intravenous forms of calcimimetics became the financial responsibility of our u.s. dialysis business for our medicare patients and are reimbursed under medicare part b. since the effective date through december 31, 2020, the oral and intravenous forms of calcimimetics were separately reimbursed through a transitional drug add-on payment adjustment (tdapa) and not as part of the esrd pps bundled payment. these separate reimbursement payments for calcimimetics were subject to change on an annual basis. during the initial tdapa period, medicare payments were based on a pass-through rate of the average sales price plus approximately 6% before sequestration (or 4% adjusted for sequestration), and in 2020 they were based on a pass-through rate of the average sales price plus 0%, before sequestration. as expected, as of january 1, 2021, calcimimetics was added to the esrd pps bundled payment. we therefore expect our operating income from calcimimetics to be more stable in the future as compared to the past three years under the tdapa model.
approximately 4% and 6% of our total u.s. dialysis patient services revenues for the years 2020 and 2019, respectively, are associated with the administration of separately-billable physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals, of which approximately 3% and 4% relate to the administration of calcimimetics, respectively.
we anticipate that we will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2021 that may outpace any net medicare rate increases that we may receive, which could significantly impact our operating results. in particular, we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, including increases in maintenance costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare payment rates or in payments under the esrd bundled payment rate system. we also continue to expect to incur additional covid-19-related costs while the pandemic continues. in addition, we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures to improve, renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet evolving regulatory requirements and otherwise.
u.s. dialysis patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers, home-based dialysis programs and hospital inpatient dialysis programs, and consist principally of labor, benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers.
the principal drivers of our u.s. dialysis patient care costs include:
•clinical hours per treatment, labor rates and benefit costs;
•vendor pricing and utilization levels of pharmaceuticals;
•business infrastructure costs, which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers; and
•certain professional fees.
other cost categories that can present significant variability include employee benefit costs, insurance costs and medical supply costs. in addition, proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes could cause us to incur substantial costs to prepare for, or implement changes required. any such changes could result in, among other things, increases in our labor costs or limitations on the amount of revenue that we can retain. for additional information on risks associated with potential and proposed ballot initiatives, referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes, see the risk factor in item 1a. risk factors under the heading, "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."
our average clinical hours per treatment decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. we are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in things such as federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can lead to increased labor costs. in 2020, the demand for skilled clinical personnel increased due to the demand of the pandemic on these resources, intensifying these competitive pressures; however, we managed to increase our overall clinical teammate retention in 2020. in 2020 and 2019, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 3.0% and 2.0%, respectively, consistent with general industry trends. we also continue to experience increases in the infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new dialysis centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. in 2020, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to help manage our overall operating costs, including labor productivity, and we expect to continue these initiatives in 2021.
our u.s. dialysis general and administrative expenses represented 9.0% and 8.1% of our u.s. dialysis revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. increases in general and administrative expenses over the last several years were primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business and related compliance and operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, professional fees associated with enhancing our information technology systems and more recent advocacy costs in 2020 related to countering union policy efforts. we expect that these levels of general and administrative expenses will be impacted by lower advocacy costs in 2021 compared to 2020, offset by continued investment in developing our capabilities and executing on our strategic priorities, among other things.

u.s. dialysis revenues in 2020 increased primarily due to an increase in dialysis treatments and an increase in our average patient service revenue per treatment. the increase in our u.s. dialysis treatments was driven by approximately one additional treatment day in 2020 compared to 2019 and an increase in acquired and non-acquired treatments, partially offset by the deconsolidation of two dialysis partnerships, as described below under the heading "equity investment income". treatments were negatively impacted by higher mortality than experienced historically as well as a decline in new admissions. we believe the increased mortality rate is largely attributable to the impact of covid-19 on our patient population. our u.s. dialysis revenues were positively impacted by an increase in our average patient service revenue per treatment driven by favorable changes in government rate, including an increase in medicare rates due to a base rate increase in 2020 and the temporary suspension of medicare sequestration as well as an increase in hospital inpatient dialysis services revenue per treatment, partially offset by a decline in calcimimetics reimbursement.

(1)general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020 included advocacy costs of approximately $67 million incurred to counter union policy efforts, including a california ballot initiative.
patient care costs. u.s. dialysis patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of compensation expenses including labor and benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers.
u.s. dialysis patient care costs per treatment decreased primarily due to decreases in pharmaceutical unit costs, as well as decreased travel expenses due to covid-19. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in labor costs and covid-19-related costs, including compensation, medical supplies and teammate relief reimbursement and benefit program expenses.
general and administrative expenses. u.s. dialysis general and administrative expenses in 2020 increased primarily due to an increase in advocacy costs incurred to counter union policy efforts, including those related to a california ballot initiative. these increases were also driven by contributions to our charitable foundation, labor costs and covid-19-related costs, including compensation expenses. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel expenses due to covid-19 and a decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense is directly impacted by the number of dialysis centers we develop and acquire. u.s. dialysis depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to growth in the number of dialysis centers we operate.
equity investment income. u.s. dialysis equity investment income increased primarily due to the deconsolidation of two of our near 50%-owned dialysis partnerships at year-end 2019, based on a reassessment of relative rights and powers over these partnerships. our portion of these partnerships' earnings are now recognized in equity investment income.

u.s. dialysis operating income and adjusted operating income in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in calcimimetics margin, increases in labor costs, advocacy costs and charitable contributions; and an increase in covid-19-related expenses, including compensation, medical supplies, and reimbursement and benefit program expenses, as described above. these decreases to operating income were partially offset by volume growth from approximately one additional treatment day in the year and an increase in our average dialysis patient service revenue per treatment, as described above, as well as decreases in pharmaceutical unit costs, travel expenses and long-term incentive compensation expense.
other - ancillary services our other operations include ancillary services that are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. as of december 31, 2020, these consisted primarily of integrated care (davita ikc), esrd seamless care organizations (escos), clinical research programs (davita clinical research), and physician services, as well as our international operations. these ancillary services, including our international operations, generated revenues of approximately $1.053 billion in 2020, representing approximately 9% of our consolidated revenues. as further described in the risk factor in item 1a. risk factors under the heading, "our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including, without limitation, our international operations, that we operate or invest in now or in the future may generate losses and may ultimately be unsuccessful. in the event that one or more of these activities is unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted and we may have to write off our investment and incur other exit costs," if any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives, such as our international operations, are unsuccessful, it could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and we may determine to exit that line of business, which could result in significant termination costs. in addition, we have in the past and may in the future incur material write-offs or impairments of our investments, including goodwill, in one or more of these ancillary services.
we expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include, among other things, healthcare services not related to dialysis.
as of december 31, 2020, our international dialysis operations provided dialysis and administrative services through a total of 321 outpatient dialysis centers located in ten countries outside of the u.s. for 2020, total revenues generated from our international operations were approximately 5% of our consolidated revenues.

revenues:
our u.s. ancillary services revenues in 2020 increased due to an increase in revenues at our integrated care business, primarily due to revenue increases in our special needs plans, as well as an increase in revenues in our esco and physician services businesses. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our clinical research programs, as well as due to the sale of lifeline, as described below. our international revenues increased primarily as a result of acquired treatment growth as we continue to expand our international business.
charges impacting operating income:
loss on changes in ownership interests, net. we sold 100% of the stock of lifeline, our vascular access business, effective may 1, 2020 and recognized a loss of approximately $16 million on this transaction.
goodwill impairment charges. during 2019, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $125 million in our international reporting units. see further discussion of these impairment charges and our reporting units that remain at risk of goodwill impairment in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
operating loss and adjusted operating loss:
our u.s. ancillary services operating loss in 2020 was negatively impacted by the loss on sale of lifeline, as described above, and both u.s. ancillary operating loss and adjusted operating loss were negatively impacted by an increase in medical costs due to covid-19 in our integrated care business and a decrease in revenue in our clinical research programs, partially offset by increases in revenues in our integrated care and esco businesses. international operating results and adjusted operating results increased in 2020 compared to 2019. international operating results in 2019 were negatively impacted by goodwill impairment charges, as described above, and both international operating results and adjusted operating results benefited in 2020 primarily from acquisition-related growth and the reduction of certain other periodic expenses, partially offset by increased medical supplies costs and higher mortality due to covid-19.
corporate administrative support corporate administrative support consists primarily of labor, benefits and long-term incentive compensation expense, as well as professional fees for departments which provide support to all of our various operating lines of business. in 2020, corporate support also included an accrual for legal matters. corporate administrative support expenses are included in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated income statement.
accruals for legal matters. during 2020, we recorded a net charge for legal matters of $35 million.
corporate administrative support expenses increased $54 million in 2020 primarily driven by accruals for legal matters, as described above. in addition, both corporate administrative support and adjusted corporate administrative support expenses increased in 2020 due to an increase in severance accruals recorded in the second quarter of 2020 associated with our senior executive leadership transition and an increase in long-term compensation expense.

debt expense debt expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in our outstanding debt balances and a decrease in the overall weighted average effective interest rate on our debt in 2020. our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2020 was 3.59% compared to 5.01% in 2019. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the components of our debt and changes in them since 2019.
debt prepayment, refinancing and redemption charges debt prepayment, refinancing and redemption charges were $89 million in 2020 as a result of the redemption in full of both our $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of 5.125% senior notes and our $1.50 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of 5.0% senior notes. these 2020 charges represented debt redemption premium charges and deferred financing cost write-offs associated with our prior senior note debt that was paid in full. these charges recognized in 2020 also included $3 million of refinancing charges comprised partially of fees incurred on the repricing of our term loan b and partially of deferred financing costs written off for the portion of this debt considered extinguished and reborrowed. in 2019, we incurred debt prepayment, refinancing and redemption charges of $33 million as a result of the repayment of all principal balances outstanding under our prior senior secured credit facilities and the redemption of our $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of 5.75% senior notes. see further discussion of our 2020 debt prepayment, refinancing and redemption charges in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
other income other income consists primarily of interest income on cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments, realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized on investments, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. other income decreased in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in interest income on our holdings of cash and cash equivalents in 2020 and a decrease in foreign currency transaction gains.
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate and effective income tax rate from continuing operations attributable to davita inc. increased in 2020 primarily due to an increase in nondeductible advocacy costs and the impact of a discrete benefit included in the 2019 tax rate from a reduction in the blended state rate. this increase was partially offset by a reduction in accruals associated with uncertain tax positions in 2020.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests the increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to improved earnings at certain u.s. dialysis partnerships, including, among other things, reimbursements we made to certain of our u.s. dialysis partnerships for certain covid-19-related expenses, partially offset by the deconsolidation of two dialysis partnerships at year-end 2019.
accounts receivable our consolidated accounts receivable balances at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, were $1.824 billion and $1.796 billion, respectively, representing approximately 59 days and 58 days of revenue (dso), respectively, net of allowances for uncollectible accounts. the increase in consolidated dso was primarily due to an increase of one day of dso in our u.s. dialysis business primarily due to held claims for covid-19-related cohort arrangement billings as well as claims from centers impacted by hurricanes in the fourth quarter of 2020. our dso calculation is based on the current quarter's average revenues per day. there were no significant changes during 2020 from 2019 in the amount of unreserved accounts receivable over one year old or the amounts pending approval from third-party payors.
as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, our net patient services accounts receivable balances that are more than six months old represents approximately 17% and 18%, respectively of our total net accounts receivable balances outstanding. substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. there were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay.
amounts pending approval from third-party payors associated with medicare bad debt claims as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $154 million and $138 million, respectively, and are classified as other receivables. a significant portion of our medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims but are subject to subsequent adjustment based upon the actual results of those audits. such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed.

(1)represents consolidated cash flow activity, including cash flows related to discontinued operations.
(2)for a reconciliation of our free cash flow from continuing operations, see the "reconciliations of non-gaap measures" section below.
consolidated cash flows consolidated cash flows from operating activities for 2020 were $1,979 million, all of which was from continuing operations, compared with consolidated operating cash flows for the same period in 2019 of $2,072 million, of which $1,973 million was from continuing operations. the increase in cash flow from continuing operations was primarily driven by a decrease in cash interest paid partially offset by covid-19-related expenses in 2020, and increases in labor and advocacy costs, as well as an increase in dso of approximately one day in 2020 compared to 2019.
cash flows from investing activities in 2020 decreased $3,821 million compared to 2019 primarily due to the net cash proceeds received from the dmg sale, which closed in june 2019, as well as an increase in acquisition expenditures partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures. we developed 31 fewer centers and acquired 51 additional centers in 2020 compared to 2019. see below for additional information regarding the growth in our dialysis centers.
cash flows from financing activities improved $2,850 million in 2020 compared to 2019. significant sources of cash during 2020 included issuances of $1,500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes due 2031 in august 2020 and $1,750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2030 in june 2020, as well as a net draw of $75 million on our revolving line of credit. significant uses of cash during 2020 included the subsequent redemptions in full of $1,500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior notes due 2025 in august 2020 and $1,750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2024 in july 2020. other net payments during 2020 primarily consisted of regularly scheduled mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling approximately $55 million on term loan a and $27 million on term loan b-1 and additional required principal payments under other debt arrangements. in addition, we incurred bond issuance costs of approximately $38 million, debt redemption premium charges related to the redemption of our senior notes due in 2024 and 2025 of approximately $67 million and costs of repricing our term loan b of approximately $3 million. see further discussion in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements related to debt financing activities. by comparison, in 2019 debt payments primarily consisted of principal prepayments totaling $5,142 million on our term debt under our prior senior secured credit facility funded primarily by the net proceeds from the dmg sale and the redemption of all of our outstanding 5.75% senior notes due in 2022 for an aggregate cash payment consisting of principal and redemption premium of $1,262 million, partially offset by funding of our term debt of $4,500 million under our new senior credit facility. cash flows used for share repurchases also decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019. see below for further information on our share repurchases.
dialysis center capacity and growth we are typically able to increase our capacity by extending hours at our existing dialysis centers, expanding our existing dialysis centers, relocating our dialysis centers, developing new dialysis centers and by acquiring dialysis centers. the development of a typical new outpatient dialysis center generally requires approximately $2.4 million for leasehold improvements and other capital expenditures. based on our experience, a new outpatient dialysis center typically opens within a year after the property lease is signed, normally achieves operating profitability in the second year after medicare certification, and normally reaches maturity within three to five years. acquiring an existing outpatient dialysis center requires a substantially greater initial investment, but profitability and cash flows are generally accelerated and more predictable. to a limited extent, we enter into agreements to provide management and administrative services to outpatient dialysis centers in which we own a noncontrolling interest or which are wholly-owned by third parties in return for management fees.

(1)the aggregate amounts paid for shares repurchased pursuant to our 2020 and 2019 tender offers for our shares during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, include their clearing prices of $88.00 and $56.50 per share, respectively, plus related fees and expenses of $2.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
subsequent to december 31, 2020, we have repurchased 1,063,000 shares of our common stock for $123 million at an average cost of $115.98 per share from january 1, 2021 through february 10, 2021. we retired all shares of common stock held in treasury effective december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019.
see further discussion of our share repurchase activity and authorizations in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
available liquidity as of december 31, 2020, our cash balance was $325 million and we held approximately $20 million in short-term investments. at that time we also had $925 million available and $75 million drawn on our $1.0 billion revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities. credit available under this revolving line of credit is reduced by the amount of any letters of credit outstanding under this facility, but we had no such letters of credit outstanding as of december 31, 2020. as of december 31, 2020 we also separately had approximately $65 million in letters of credit outstanding under a separate bilateral secured letter of credit facility.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for components of our long-term debt and their interest rates.
the covid-19 pandemic and efforts to prevent its spread have dramatically reduced global economic activity and driven increased volatility in the financial markets. we have maintained business process continuity during the covid-19 pandemic by enabling most back office teammates to work remotely, and as of the date of this report, we have not experienced a material deterioration in our liquidity position as a result of the covid-19 crisis. in addition, we elected not to accept approximately $250 million in funds available to us through the cares act provider relief fund and returned the funds we received in may 2020. there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to forgo financial or other assistance available under the cares act or similar subsequent legislation or that similar assistance will be available from the government if we have a need for such assistance in the future. the ultimate impact of the pandemic will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
we believe that our cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including from amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our access to the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our scheduled debt service under the terms of our debt agreements and other obligations for the foreseeable future, including the next 12 months. our primary recurrent sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings, which are subject to general, economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, as described in item 1a risk factors under the heading "the level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business, and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes and our ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants depends on many factors beyond our control."
reconciliations of non-gaap measures the following tables provide reconciliations of adjusted operating income (loss) to operating income (loss) as presented on a u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) basis for our u.s. dialysis reportable segment as well as for our u.s. ancillary services, our international business, and for our total ancillary services which combines them and is disclosed as our other segments category. these non-gaap or "adjusted" measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to, but not alternatives for, our gaap results.
specifically, management uses adjusted operating income (loss) to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. we believe this non-gaap measure is also useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. we also believe this presentation enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations.
in addition, our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations attributable to davita inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities. we believe this adjusted effective income tax rate is useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to davita inc.
finally, our free cash flow from continuing operations represents net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions to noncontrolling interests and all capital expenditures (including development capital expenditures, routine maintenance and information technology), plus contributions from noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the sale of self-developed properties. management uses this measure to assess our ability to fund acquisitions and meet our debt service obligations and we believe this measure is equally useful to investors and analysts as an adjunct to cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations and other measures under gaap.
it is important to bear in mind that these non-gaap "adjusted" measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation from, nor as substitutes for, their most comparable gaap measures.

off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations and operating lease liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with letters of credit, as well as certain working capital funding obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated dialysis ventures that we manage and some we manage that are wholly-owned by third parties.
we also have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in many of our majority-owned dialysis partnerships and other nonconsolidated entities. these obligations are in the form of put provisions that are exercisable at the third-party owners' discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. for additional information see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
the following is a summary of these contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2020:

in 2017, we entered into a sourcing and supply agreement with amgen usa inc. (amgen) that expires on december 31, 2022. under the terms of the agreement, the company will purchase epo from amgen in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of its requirements for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (esas) through the expiration of the contract. the actual amount of epo that we will purchase will depend upon the amount of epo administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that we serve.
the purchase commitments in the table above represent our agreements with various suppliers to purchase set amounts of dialysis equipment, parts, and supplies. if we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitments under these contracts during any year, it is required to pay the difference to the supplier.
settlements of approximately $88 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, penalties and other long-term tax liabilities, are excluded from the table above as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made.
contingencies the information in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item.
critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. these accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions (redeemable equity interests). all significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. actual results will generally differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on-going actual experience trends or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of goodwill, accounting for income taxes, fair value estimates, and loss contingencies are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. for additional information, see part ii item 15, "exhibits, financial statement schedules" - note 1 - "organization and summary of significant accounting policies" as referred from part ii item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
u.s. dialysis revenue recognition and accounts receivable. there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of u.s. dialysis revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. in addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters.
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs providing secondary coverage (e.g., medicaid secondary coverage), the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. our dialysis related reimbursements from medicare are subject to certain variations under medicare's single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and other variable factors. our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for medicare's base payment rate and these other factors. in addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our dialysis-related reimbursements from medicare under the single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is subject to a greater degree of estimating risk.
commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed-care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients covered under commercial healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non-contracted commercial healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, the estimated timing of collections, changes in our expectations of the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance matters. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our approximately 204,200 u.s. dialysis patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided.
we generally expect the range of our u.s. dialysis revenue estimating risk to be within 1% of revenue, which can represent as much as approximately 5% of our u.s. dialysis business's adjusted operating income. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current financial statements based on on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant.
revenues for laboratory services, which are integrally related to our dialysis services, are recognized in the period services are provided at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received.
impairments of goodwill. we account for impairments of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment when changes in circumstances warrant and at least annually. an impairment charge is recorded when and to the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to exceed its estimated fair value.
changes in circumstance that may trigger a goodwill impairment assessment for one of our business units can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, addressable market, business strategy, development or business plans, reimbursement structure, operating performance, future prospects, relationships with partners, and/or market value indications for the subject business. we use a variety of factors to assess changes in the financial condition, future prospects and other circumstances concerning the subject businesses and to estimate their fair value when applicable. any change in the factors, assessments or assumptions involved could affect a determination of whether and when to assess goodwill for impairment as well as the outcome of such an assessment. these assessments and the related valuations can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement.
accounting for income taxes. our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous state and foreign jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. the actual impact of any such laws or regulations could be materially different from our current estimates.
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, results of recent operations, and assumptions about the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgments and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.
fair value estimates. the fasb defines fair value generally as the amount at which an asset (or liability) could be bought (or assumed) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. it also defines fair value more specifically for most purposes as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
we rely on fair value measurements and estimates for purposes that require the recording, reassessment, or adjustment of the carrying amounts of certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions (redeemable equity interests). these purposes can include purchase accounting for business combination transactions; impairment assessments for goodwill, other intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; recurrent revaluation of investments in debt and equity securities, contingent earn-out obligations, interest rate cap agreements, and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions; and the accounting for equity method and other investments and stock-based compensation, among others. the criticality of a particular fair value estimate to our consolidated financial statements depends upon the nature and size of the item being measured, the extent of uncertainties involved and the nature and magnitude or potential effect of assumptions and judgments required. critical fair value estimates can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement.
loss contingencies. as discussed in notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, we operate in a highly regulated industry and are party to various lawsuits, claims, qui tam suits, governmental investigations and audits (including, without limitation, investigations or other actions resulting from its obligation to self-report suspected violations of law), contract disputes and other legal proceedings. assessments of such matters can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. we record accruals for loss contingencies on such matters to the extent that we determine an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion.
significant new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for information regarding certain recent financial accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb.

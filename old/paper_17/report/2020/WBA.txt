item 1a.  risk factors in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. covid-19 amplifies and exacerbates many of the risks we face in our business operations, including those discussed below. these risks are not the only risks that we face. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.
our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position have been and will in the future be adversely impacted by covid-19, and the duration and extent to which it will impact our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position remains uncertain.
in december 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as covid-19, was reported. the world health organization declared covid-19 a "public health emergency of international concern" on january 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on march 11, 2020. covid-19 has severely impacted, and is expected to continue to severely impact, the economies of the u.s., the uk and other countries around the world. covid-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations. while we have taken numerous steps intended to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on us, there can be no assurance that such steps will be successful or that our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position will not be materially and adversely affected by the consequences of the pandemic.
the extent to which covid-19 impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict or control, including but not limited to:
•the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional "waves" or other additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid-19 cases in areas in which we operate;
•the duration, degree and effectiveness of governmental, business or other actions in response to the pandemic, including but not limited to quarantine, shelter-in-place, social distancing and facemask measures; restrictions on or changes to our operations up to and including complete or partial closure of our stores, facilities and distribution centers; economic measures; access to unemployment compensation; stimulus payments and other fiscal policy changes; or additional measures that may not yet be effected;
•the timing and availability of, and prevalence of access to and utilization of, effective medical treatments and vaccines for covid-19;
•changes in the timing and extent of restrictions impacting our businesses and our customers as a result of covid-19, which may vary materially over time and among the different regions and markets we serve;
•evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures;
•the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and the pace and extent of recovery when the pandemic subsides, which may vary materially over time and among the different regions and markets we serve;
•the extent and duration of the effect on consumer confidence, economic well-being, spending, customer demand, buying patterns and shopping behaviors, including spend on discretionary categories, which often include higher margin products, and increased utilization of online sales channels, both during and after the pandemic;
•the health of and the effect on our team members and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, distribution facilities, wholesale operations, corporate offices and other critical functions, including if team members are quarantined as a result of exposure;
•the impacts - financial, operational and otherwise - on our distribution channels and supply chain, including manufacturers and suppliers of products we sell and logistics and transportation providers, and on our other strategic
- 9 -
partners and service providers, including the ability of these third parties to pay amounts owed to us timely or in full or to remain in business;
•consequences on our business performance and strategic initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response;
•the incremental costs of doing business during and/or after the pandemic;
•volatility or disruptions in the credit and financial markets during and/or after the pandemic;
•any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions;
•the potential effects on our internal controls including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that are applicable to our team members and business partners, among others;
•changes to, and modifications of, business practices and internal policies and procedures, including in response to regulatory changes as a result of covid-19;
•increased cyber security risks, including as a result of our team members, and employees of our business partners, vendors, suppliers and other third parties with which we do business, working remotely;
•the impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers compensation and potential increases in insurance costs, medical claims costs and workers' compensation claim costs;
•the impact of litigation or claims from customers, employees, suppliers, regulators or other third parties relating to covid-19 or our actions in response thereto;
•the potential reputational harm to our brands if we fail to appropriately respond, or are perceived to have inadequately responded, to risks relating to covid-19;
•the rapidly changing and fluid circumstances caused by the pandemic and our ability to respond quickly or appropriately to those circumstances; and
•the long-term impacts of the pandemic on the global economy, trade relations, consumer behavior, our industry and our business operations.
the above factors and uncertainties, or others of which we are not currently aware, may result in material adverse impacts to our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in addition, we cannot predict with certainty the impact that covid-19 will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material adverse effect on these parties could materially and adversely impact us.
we have incurred and continue to incur additional costs related to efforts to protect the health and well-being and meet the needs of our customers and team members, including expanding the use of drive-thru locations in the united states, providing additional cleaning materials for our stores and other facilities, and focusing on home delivery and digital services to connect with our customers. in addition, we have enhanced certain employee benefits. we expect to continue to incur additional costs, which may be significant, as we continue to respond to this pandemic. covid-19 has also caused supply chain disruption which has resulted and may continue to result in higher supply chain costs to replenish inventory in our stores and distribution centers. furthermore, while we have significantly increased our purchases across many key categories, we may face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products which could negatively impact us.
further, our management remains focused on mitigating covid-19, which has required, and will continue to require, a substantial investment of time and resources across our enterprise and could delay other value added services. for example, during the second half of fiscal 2020, we temporarily refocused certain resources from our transformational cost management program to work on covid-19 impacts, delayed the roll out of certain growth initiatives and selectively delayed investments in certain planned initiatives. additionally, many of our employees transitioned to remote working arrangements as a result of the pandemic, which amplified our already extensive reliance on computer systems and our continued need for unimpeded access to the internet to use those systems. the increase in remote work arrangements has increased certain operational risks, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and could adversely affect our ability to manage our business. we have also modified other parts of our operations during the pandemic, including changes in the manner in which team members interact with customers and each other, adjusting our in-store returns process, establishing protocols for customer traffic, reducing store hours, and, in some locations, other restrictions or modifications on our operations due to emergency state or local restrictions or their effects. there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the pandemic, and implementation of such measures have adversely affected, and may continue to negatively affect, the customer experience, sales, and our results from operations.
the impact of covid-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, brand reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability, litigation and legal proceedings, and
- 10 -
regulatory requirements and proceedings, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. this situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.
reductions in third-party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
the substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third-party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pbm companies, governmental agencies, and other third-party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. in the united states, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. in addition, the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliations payments can vary significantly and may not follow a predictable path. further, in an environment where some pbm clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers.
changes in political, economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices. in the united states, for example, there have been multiple attempts through executive action, legislative action and legal challenges to modify or repeal healthcare legislation, along with additional initiatives focused on increasing transparency and reducing costs in the u.s. healthcare system. we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify or repeal these laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a modification or repeal and any subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement levels. there have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce medicare part d and medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits, and we expect additional proposals in the future. in the event that a third-party payer's budgetary or financial condition deteriorates, they may not be able to pay timely, or may delay payment of, amounts owed to us. there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations. in many countries where we have operations, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. efforts to control healthcare costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuous and reductions in third-party reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, many payers in the united states are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates. it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts. in addition, many state medicaid fee-for-service programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost, which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements. future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third-party payers, could adversely affect us.
a shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans, products, and programs could adversely affect our results of operations.
our retail pharmacy usa division seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure. a shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. for example, our retail pharmacy usa division has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in recent years and more recently during the covid-19 pandemic, and specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states and a larger proportion of our revenues. our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, and specialty pharmacy sales are generally also lower margin. our retail pharmacy usa division also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions in recent years, and that trend may continue. preferred medicare part d networks have increased in number in recent years; however, we do not participate in all such networks. we have accepted market competitive reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer. if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies.
we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of pbm companies. pbm companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. changes in pricing and other terms of our contracts with pbm companies can significantly impact our results of operations. there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company's pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period or on terms reasonably acceptable to us. if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. if we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. if we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the pbm company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. in addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans.
we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. successfully managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to our success, and failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance.
our ability to attract, engage, develop and retain qualified and experienced employees at all levels, including in executive and other key strategic positions, is essential for us to meet our objectives. we compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees. competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries, benefits or other employee-related costs, or in our failure to recruit and retain employees. we may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes, such as illness, and must adequately plan for succession of key roles. any of these risks could have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
any failure to adequately plan for and manage succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. while we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us. in july 2020, we announced a search for a new chief executive officer (ceo). we also announced that when the new ceo takes office, stefano pessina will resign as ceo and executive vice chairman of the board and be appointed as the executive chairman of the board (subject to applicable law, including fiduciary duties) and james skinner will resign as executive chairman of the board, while remaining on the board to help facilitate a smooth transition. any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risks and any failure to timely hire a qualified ceo and ensure a smooth transition could hinder the company's strategic planning, execution and future performance. changes in the senior management team also may create uncertainty among investors, employees, business partners and others concerning the company's future direction and performance. any disruption in the company's operations or adverse impacts from such uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
we could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.
the profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs. utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs. inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization, particularly given the increased prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. new brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, delays in their introduction, or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify

our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations.
consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations.
many organizations in the healthcare industry, including pbm companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. if this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. if these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams.
new and proposed acquisitions, partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning. for example, in november 2018, cvs health corporation, an integrated pharmacy health care company that operates one of the largest retail drugstore chains and pbm companies in the united states, acquired aetna, inc., one of the largest diversified health care benefits companies. changes in the participants in global sourcing enterprises relating to drug procurement, whether as a result of mergers, acquisitions or other transactions, can also have a similar effect on market dynamics and our business. in addition, further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future. we expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with, and which could, if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner, materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances.
a significant element of our growth strategy is to identify, pursue and successfully complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations. we have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire, partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives. for example, in july 2020, the company announced that it plans to invest $1.0 billion in equity and convertible debt in villagemd over the next three years, including a $250 million equity investment completed in july 2020, subject to the terms of the agreement. the company and villagemd also announced plans to open 500 to 700 "village medical at walgreens" physician-led primary care clinics in more than 30 u.s. markets in the next five years. due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete, there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available. there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available, that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities, or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources.
acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel, navigating the necessary regulatory approval requirements, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. these transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders' percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed. no assurance can be given that our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition or results of operations. if we are unable to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner, our business operations and growth strategies could be adversely affected.

our strategic relationships include outsourcing and similar relationships. we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. we rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. if our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with any transition, we may experience operational difficulties, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations.
we are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.
we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. we are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities, including those contained in note 10, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. for example, in january 2019, walgreen co., on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and certain identified affiliates, resolved matters regarding certain dispensing practices by entering into, among other things, a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services. the corporate integrity agreement has a five-year term and provides that walgreen co. shall, among other things, continue the compliance program it created to address compliance with federal health care program requirements, provide annual certifications of compliance and provide training and education for certain covered employees. failure to meet the corporate integrity agreement obligations could have material adverse consequences for us, including reputational harm and monetary penalties for each instance of non-compliance. in addition, in the event of a breach or deliberate violation of the corporate integrity agreement, we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs, or subjected to other significant penalties, which could seriously harm our results of operations, liquidity and financial results.
legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. for example, we are a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings relating to opioid matters, including federal multidistrict litigation that consolidated numerous cases filed against an array of defendants by various plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, indian tribes, and others, as well as numerous lawsuits brought in state courts. additionally, the company has received from the department of justice and the attorney generals of numerous states subpoenas, civil investigative demands and/or other requests concerning opioid matters. from time to time, the company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. see note 10, commitments and contingencies, for more information.
the company's financial results may also be adversely affected by the litigation and other legal proceedings of companies in which it has an equity method investment. for example, amerisourcebergen is required to publicly disclose in its sec filings certain information regarding material litigation and legal proceedings it is involved in, including those relating to opioid matters if applicable. any unfavorable outcome or settlement related to these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial results.
like other companies in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries, the company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which it operates. there continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities of, and increased litigation regarding business, compliance and reporting practices of the company and other industry participants. as a result, the company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above. in addition, under the qui tam or "whistleblower" provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of "false" claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including medicare and medicaid. after a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination.
we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. as a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. in addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, the company may be subject to damages, civil or
- 14 -
criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs. the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources.
our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives.
our board of directors approved the plans to implement the transformational cost management program described in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. there can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of these programs. our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in the transformational cost management program and other business optimization initiatives. if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving. new entrants to the market, existing competitor actions or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us.
the level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high. changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. disruptive innovation, or the perception of potentially disruptive innovation, by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. for example, in 2018, online retailer amazon.com, inc. acquired pillpack, an online pharmacy with licenses throughout the united states, helping amazon to expand into the market for prescription drugs. our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local, regional, national and global companies, including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors, including national and regional cooperative wholesalers, and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. competition may also come from other sources in the future. as competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, including pressure on the convenience premium of our retail pricing model, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. for example, if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our pharmaceutical wholesale division, including changes driven by competitors, suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers, it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms.
we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. as technology, consumer behavior, omni-channel and differential retail models, and market conditions continue to evolve in the united states, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and product and service offerings to customers and patients. in recent years, we announced that we are testing a number of concepts and initiatives designed to position our stores in the united states as convenient neighborhood health destinations for healthcare and retail products and services. the concepts being tested include new approaches to pricing and promotions, product selection, in-store and digital experience, and strategic partnerships that bring new products and services to our customers. we plan to use these pilots to listen to customers, learn and adjust based on feedback, with decisions on the nature and extent of further roll-outs made over time as we gain experience. for example, the company and villagemd announced a collaboration in april 2019 where villagemd would operate five primary care clinics next to walgreens stores in the houston, texas area and, based on the results of that pilot, in july 2020 announced plans to open 500 to 700 "village medical at walgreens" physician-led primary care clinics in more than 30 u.s. markets in the next five years. if our customers are not receptive to these changes, if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner, or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics, our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. additionally, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of
- 15 -
prescription drug spending in the united states, a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs), that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. accordingly, it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market, or our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. to better serve this evolving market, in march 2017, we and prime therapeutics llc, a pbm, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, alliancerx walgreens prime, using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy, pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. prime's clients are not obligated to contract through our joint venture, and have in the past, and may in the future, enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving our joint venture. if this joint venture is not able to compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.
our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects, including particularly those of our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions, and are subject to a number of risks, including:
•compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including retail and wholesale pharmacy, licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, immigration, currency, political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations, whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time;
•additional u.s. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the foreign corrupt practices act, the uk bribery act and other anti-corruption laws;
•potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;
•price controls imposed by foreign countries, tariffs, duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries that restrict or prohibit business transactions in certain markets, or fluctuations in currency rates;
•impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the united states, including foreign currency devaluation, higher interest rates, inflation, and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses;
•the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets; and
•developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes, and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services.
these factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition.
many of these factors are subject to change based on changes in political, economic and regulatory influences. for example:
•our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions have substantial operations in the united kingdom and other member countries of the european union. in june 2016, voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union, which resulted in the united kingdom leaving the european union on january 31, 2020. since the referendum, there have been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market conditions in the united kingdom and many of the risks and uncertainties described above have been and may continue to be exacerbated. there is now a transition period until december 31, 2020 in which the united kingdom and european union are to negotiate a new

trading relationship for goods and services. failure to complete negotiations by the implementation deadline of december 31, 2020 could result in the united kingdom reverting to undesirable and adverse trade agreements with the european union. given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal and related negotiations, including with respect to terms of trade and customs, there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. the withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. the withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties. further, uncertainty around and developments regarding these and related issues has contributed to deteriorating market conditions and could further adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the economy of the united kingdom and the economies of other countries in which we operate and cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates; and
•many of the products we sell are manufactured in whole or in part outside of the united states. in some cases, these products are imported by others and sold to us. in the united states, the presidential administration has discussed, and in some cases implemented, changes with respect to certain tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries. for example, concerns regarding trade relations between the united states and china have escalated in recent years and discussions have continued through the date of this report, as both countries imposed significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. as a significant portion of our retail products are sourced from china, the imposition on the united states of these and any additional new tariffs on certain goods imported from china have adversely affected costs and could impact the profitability of retail product sales in our retail pharmacy usa division. while it is not possible to predict whether or when any additional changes will occur or what form they may take, significant changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries could result in significant increases in our costs, restrict our access to certain suppliers and adversely impact economic activity. in addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in united states' trade policy and regulations.
there can be no assurance that any or all of these developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.
we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
we operate or have equity method investments in more than 25 countries across the globe, and our significant presence outside of the united states exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses' functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we present our financial statements in u.s. dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-u.s. dollar currencies, primarily the british pound sterling and the euro, as well as a range of other foreign currencies. our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. in addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the u.s. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. a depreciation of non-u.s. dollar currencies relative to the u.s. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.
we may from time to time, in some instances, enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us, that could materially and adversely affect us. additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. the periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including particularly the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, will not materially affect our consolidated financial results.
a significant disruption in our information technology and computer systems or those of businesses we rely on could harm us.
we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. our systems are subject to damage or interruption from
- 17 -
power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber attacks, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. if any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.
in addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, outsourcing critical information technology to third parties, making changes to existing systems, including the migration of applications to the cloud, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, changes in security processes, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. we rely on strategic partners and other service providers to help us with certain significant information technology projects and services, including tata consultancy services, to whom the company is currently transitioning its it run and operational managed services, and microsoft, who is the company's strategic cloud provider and with whom the company has a strategic partnership to develop new health care delivery models, technology and retail innovations to advance and improve the future of health care. information technology projects or services frequently are long-term in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete. furthermore, pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously could make implementation significantly more challenging. we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and outsourcing critical information technology functions and there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation, that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations. we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including strategic and business partners, key payers and vendors. any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations.
privacy and data protection laws increase our compliance burden and any failure to comply could harm us.
the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas. we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. in the united states, for example, hipaa imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by covered entities in the health care industry, including health care providers such as pharmacies. in addition, the california consumer privacy act, which went into effect on january 1, 2020, imposes stringent requirements on the use and treatment of "personal information" of california residents, and other jurisdictions have enacted, or are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal data. outside the united states, for example, the european union's general data protection regulation, which became effective in may 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance. other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders.
complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and operating results. we may also face audits or investigations by various government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, and other costs. we also have contractual obligations that might be breached if we fail to comply. a significant privacy breach or failure to comply with privacy laws could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, business operations, financial position and results of operations.
we and businesses we interact with experience cybersecurity incidents and might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches.
the protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach or theft of customer, employee, or company data, could create significant
- 18 -
workflow disruption, attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships, reputation and brand, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. in addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. we also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of third-parties for many aspects of our business operations, including payers, strategic partners and cloud service providers. these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations. like other global companies, we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems, including from vandalism or theft of physical systems or media and from perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions.
compromises of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact which result in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, have in the past and could in the future adversely impact us. any such compromise could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business operations, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, security incidents may require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses. the risks associated with data security and cybersecurity incidents have increased during the covid-19 pandemic given the increased reliance on remote work arrangements.
a significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability.
we operate in complex, highly regulated environments around the world and could be materially and adversely affected by changes to applicable legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins, product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored. our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing, billing practices, utilization and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. the regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including hipaa; the aca or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, each of which continues to evolve, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") and drug enforcement administration ("dea"), trade regulations including those of the u.s. federal trade commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy. for example, in the united states, the dea, fda and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. we are required to hold valid dea and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. the dea, fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. we are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit, competition and antitrust matters. in addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party's intellectual property rights.
changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business. the impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. untimely
- 19 -
compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and the national health service in the united kingdom; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and brand, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
we could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws.
we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. for example, we are subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa"), u.s. export control, anti-money laundering and economic and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the uk bribery act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. the fcpa generally prohibits u.s. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. the fcpa also requires that u.s. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. if we are found to have violated the fcpa, u.s. export control, economic and trade sanctions, or anti-money laundering laws or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws or to have otherwise conducted business activities inappropriately or unethically, including through acts of bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest, fraud, manipulation of records or dealings with inappropriate business counterparties or partners, we may face penalties, sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. in addition, new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions, and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which, if enacted, could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. from time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses.
the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as covid-19 or other health epidemics or pandemics, labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a supplier's financial distress, natural disasters, looting, vandalism or acts of war or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
we use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our retail pharmacy usa division.
in march 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen in the united states and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generic pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise. in may 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. in addition, in march 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen's board of directors in certain circumstances. as of the date of this report, amerisourcebergen distributes for our retail pharmacy usa division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical products. consequently, our business in the united states may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that amerisourcebergen experiences, including those resulting from covid-19. for example, if amerisourcebergen's operations are seriously
- 20 -
disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, pandemic, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business in the united states and our results of operations.
our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. if such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary. however, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized.
as of august 31, 2020, we beneficially owned approximately 28% of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one nominee for election to amerisourcebergen's board of directors. in addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the framework agreement dated as of march 18, 2013 by and among the company, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen (the "framework agreement") to acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another nominee for election to amerisourcebergen's board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. there can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in amerisourcebergen, or that our existing investment, or any future investment if completed, will ultimately be profitable.
the company accounts for its investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the company's pharmaceutical wholesale segment. the financial performance of amerisourcebergen, including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation matters, will impact the company's results of operations. additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of amerisourcebergen's common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. these considerations may materially and adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations.
further, our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with amerisourcebergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations, which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities in amounts and at the times desired. we could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration resulting from these agreements. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
from time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks.
from time to time, we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. for example, while we have a significant equity investment in amerisourcebergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of amerisourcebergen as of the date of this report, we do not have the ability to control day-to-day operations of that company. some of the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments operate in markets or industries that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. for example we have an equity investment in villagemd, a leading provider of value-based primary care services in the united states, and sinopharm holding guoda drugstores co., ltd., a leading retail pharmacy chain in china. investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic partnerships and alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons.
- 21 -
changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices.
our performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. these conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. external factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, inflation, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, health epidemics or pandemics (such as covid-19), as well as looting, vandalism, acts of war or terrorism. changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. our business operations have been adversely affected by challenging market conditions in our retail pharmacy international division, particularly our boots business in the united kingdom, on account of the economic environment, including the impacts of covid-19 and the uncertainty associated with brexit. in addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. all of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and has accelerated significantly during the covid-19 pandemic. the pace of this increase could further accelerate in the future. our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. omni-channel and differentiated retail models are rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases, as well as to provide immediate public reactions regarding various facets of our operations. we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. if we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. in addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations.
if the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected.
we could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences, including attitudes towards our retail and product brands. the success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers, including enhanced health and beauty product offerings. we must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers, whose preferences may change in the future. for example, our proof of concept initiatives that seek to position our stores in the united states as convenient neighborhood health destinations for healthcare and retail products and services reflect the perceived desires and needs of our target market. however, it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. if we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers' purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer. in addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices. failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.
our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks.
in addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that in many instances, are not available from other retailers. we seek to continue to grow our private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the offering of no7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers, as well as the timely development and introduction of new products, is important in differentiating us from other retailers and
- 22 -
developing and maintaining customer loyalty. the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business operations, results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to payment-related and other financial services risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.
we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as apple paytm, and we may offer new payment options over time. acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. these requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which has made and could continue to make compliance more difficult or costly. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. if these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. in addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
additionally, we offer money (wire) transfer services and sell prepaid debit, credit and gift cards at certain business units. these products and services require us to comply with global anti-money laundering laws and regulations. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and damage to our reputation.
changes in the healthcare industry and regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses.
political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. in recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. these changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the united states and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing, and these pressures could be further exacerbated if payer deficits or shortfalls increase due to covid-19 or otherwise. changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies and practices as well as applicable government regulations, including, for example, in connection with the federal 340b drug pricing program, could also significantly reduce our profitability.
in the united states, electoral results and changes in political leadership often generate uncertainty with respect to, and could result in, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the healthcare and retail industries. we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify healthcare laws or regulations and/or adopt new healthcare legislation or regulations will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results. future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments could impact the number of americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage, increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. we cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative, rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
- 23 -
we could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues.
we could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labeling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites, including through services provided by third-party health care providers, we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we offer. errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, including related counseling, and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death. product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the retail products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. for example, from time to time, the fda issues statements alerting patients that products in our supply chain may contain impurities or harmful substances, and claims relating to the sale or distribution of such products may be asserted against us or arise from these statements. our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments. we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. we could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we, or any affiliated entities or third-party healthcare providers that we do business with, experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
we have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt.
we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. in an effort to strengthen our liquidity position while navigating covid-19, we took a number of proactive steps in fiscal 2020, including the issuance of long-term debt, entering into new revolving credit facilities and extending an existing facility, and establishing a euro commercial paper program, as described in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources" below. as of august 31, 2020, we had approximately $16 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term debt. our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:
•requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends;
•making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;
•reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions and making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and
•exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates.
we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants.
additionally, a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, some of which is tied to the london interbank offered rate for deposits of u.s. dollars ("libor"). libor tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates, rates set by the federal reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions. in july 2017, the united kingdom financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. moreover, it is possible that libor may be discontinued prior to the end of 2021. certain of our credit facilities provide that, under certain circumstances set forth in such credit facilities, we and the administrative agent may amend the applicable credit facility to replace libor with an alternate benchmark rate, giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in the u.s. market for alternative benchmarks. the expected phase out of libor and transition to and use of an alternative benchmark rate could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely affect our access to the capital markets and cost of funding.

our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. in addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. this could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.
we could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access well-functioning capital markets.
historically, we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy. financial and credit markets have experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility and turmoil during the covid-19 pandemic. our continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. the major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings as of the date of this report. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. we benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors, including landlords for our leased stores, on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses. for more information on our ratings, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - credit ratings" below.
there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant, which in some circumstances could adversely affect benefits we currently enjoy. incurrence of additional debt by us and our changes in our operating performance, whether due to business operations, covid-19, legal proceedings or otherwise, could adversely affect our credit ratings. we depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them. defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us. any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any actual or anticipated downgrade of our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, financial covenants, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we utilize working capital financing arrangements, including receivable factoring programs. changes in financial markets or interest rates could make these financing arrangements less attractive to the financial institutions and other counterparties and these financial institutions and other counterparties may seek to terminate their participation. in the event of such termination, our ability to effectively manage working capital could be adversely impacted.
we may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. local land use and zoning regulations, environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing, renovating and operating our stores. in addition, real estate, zoning, construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs. further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores. the terms of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of, or requested modifications to, those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. for example, we announced plans as part of our transformational cost management program to exit approximately 200 boots stores in the united kingdom and approximately 250 stores in the united states. if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term. if we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
as a holding company, walgreens boots alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.
walgreens boots alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own. its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and its business is conducted through, subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. as a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including walgreens and international subsidiaries, to meet its obligations.
- 25 -
additionally, walgreens boots alliance's subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to walgreens boots alliance, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of walgreens boots alliance common stock. credit facilities and other debt obligations of walgreens boots alliance, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends. payments to walgreens boots alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries' earnings and business considerations. future walgreens boots alliance dividends will be determined based on earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by its board of directors.
our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.
our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis, including increased variability during the covid-19 pandemic, and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to the impact and duration of covid-19, the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; seasonality, including the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes or rates of change in payer reimbursement rates and terms; the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliation payments, fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairment charges, including the performance of and impairment charges related to our equity method investments; the relative magnitude of our lifo provision in any particular quarter; foreign currency fluctuations; market conditions, including any impact relating to brexit; severe weather in key markets, widespread looting or vandalism; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not place undue reliance on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.
our businesses are seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results.
our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (december, january and february) typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. we purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season. adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling seasons. for example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs. this could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year.
we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters.
generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, equity method investments, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, pension and postretirement benefits, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. for example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the company's reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, may have an adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations. factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit or asset group. factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate. although our current accounting estimates contemplate current and expected future conditions, as applicable, actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. in particular, a number of estimates have been and will continue to be affected by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. the severity, magnitude and duration, as well as the economic consequences of covid-19, are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. as a result, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time. such changes could result in
- 26 -
future impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets, excess and obsolete inventory, or a decrease in the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets, which could be material.
new accounting guidance also may require changes to our processes, accounting systems and internal controls that could increase our operating costs and/or significantly change our financial statements. implementing new accounting guidance may require us to make significant changes to and investments in our accounting systems and processes, which could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements. see, "new accounting pronouncements," within note 1, summary of major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.
as of august 31, 2020, we had $26.0 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets. we evaluate this goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. as part of this impairment analysis, we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. we determine fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt and equity, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization, whether due to covid-19 or otherwise. for example, during the three months ended may 31, 2020, the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to its two reporting units, within retail pharmacy international division, and based on this analysis, recorded impairment charges of $1.7 billion on boots goodwill and $0.3 billion on certain indefinite-lived boots tradename assets. see note 6, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7 below for additional information. there can be no assurance that further impairments will not occur.
we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.
we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions around the world. as such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the u.s. federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. as the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision.
from time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. for example, the u.s. tax legislation enacted in december 2017 represented a significant overhaul of the u.s. federal tax code that impacted our u.s. federal income tax position. there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the united states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.
tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, the determination of our income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. the ultimate tax determination may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made. any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. any changes in enacted tax laws (such as the recent u.s. tax legislation), rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.
- 27 -
we might experience substantial losses not covered by insurance.
we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers' compensation; automobile and general liability; property, director and officers' liability; and employee healthcare benefits. provisions for losses related to self-insured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. substantial, unanticipated losses or liabilities, including those due to natural disasters or otherwise, as well as changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities.
we operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom, which were closed to new entrants in 2010, as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions. the valuation of the pension plans' assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. this valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.
as of september 30, 2020, stefano pessina, our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer (together with his affiliates, the "sp investors"), had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 16.9% of our outstanding common stock. the sp investors have agreed to, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board's recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the company's stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). the sp investors' significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. the influence of the sp investors could result in the company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. as a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with.
conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved. for example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the company and other parties to the company shareholders agreement (as defined herein), including the sp investors. mr. pessina, our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer, indirectly controls alliance santé participations s.a. ("asp"), a privately-held company which is a party to the company shareholders agreement, and he and his partner ornella barra, our co-chief operating officer, serve as directors of asp. there are other arrangements between affiliates of mr. pessina and the company, with required disclosures included in the company's annual proxy statement, including with respect to alliance healthcare italia spa, which is an entity indirectly owned and controlled by mr. pessina and in which the company has an indirect 9% interest, which operates boots branded stores in italy. conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, or similar issues could arise in connection with these or other transactions in the future. while our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties' conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies.
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our board or impede a takeover.
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl"), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. these provisions include
- 28 -
the authorization of the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock that could be issued by the board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. we are also subject to the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock.
under the company shareholders agreement, the sp investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the board (currently stefano pessina) for so long as the sp investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. pursuant to the company shareholders agreement, the sp investors have agreed that, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board's recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors).
while these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable.
we cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.
in june 2018, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock. the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable or at all. there can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. activity under this program was suspended in july 2020 and there can be no assurance whether or when activity will resume. if resumed, the repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.
the market price of our common stock may be volatile.
the market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. broad general economic, political, market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of the shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. in addition to the other risk factors identified herein that could cause fluctuations in the price of the shares include:
•actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and the results of competitors;
•changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts that might cover us;
•conditions or trends in the industry, including regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace;
•announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;
•announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;
•additions or departures of key personnel;
•issuances or sales of our common stock (or the exercise of related registration rights), including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors, including the sp investors and certain other former alliance boots stockholders, subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to a shareholders agreement (as amended, the "company shareholders agreement") with certain of the sp investors; and
•various other market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors or speculation, whether or not correct, involving or affecting us or our industries, vendors, customers, strategic partners or competitors.
there are a number of additional business risks that could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results.
many other factors could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results, including:
- 29 -
•our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs;
•inflation, new or increased taxes, changes in market conditions or otherwise;
•natural disasters, severe weather conditions, looting, vandalism, terrorist activities, global political and economic developments, war, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events;
•liabilities or expense relating to the protection of the environment, related health and safety matters, environmental remediation or compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances;
•the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmacy industry in particular, along with changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery;
•adverse publicity and potential losses, liabilities and reputational harm stemming from any public incident or practice (whether occurring online, in social media, in our stores or other company facilities, or elsewhere) involving our company, our personnel or our brands, including any such public incident or practice involving our customers, products, services, stores or other property, or those of any of our vendors or other parties with which we do business; and
•negative publicity, even if unwarranted, related to safety or quality, human and workplace rights, or other issues damaging our brand image and corporate reputation, or that of any of our vendors or strategic allies.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the company's business and reportable segments in item 1 above. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below and in risk factors in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k. references herein to the "company," "we," "us," or "our" refer to walgreens boots alliance, inc. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.

•retail pharmacy usa;
•retail pharmacy international; and
•pharmaceutical wholesale see note 16, segment reporting and note 17, sales further information.
factors affecting our results and comparability the company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. these factors include: the impact of the coronavirus covid-19 ("covid-19") pandemic on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including amerisourcebergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies; strategic transactions and acquisitions, including the acquisition of stores and other assets from rite aid; joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including the u.s. tax law changes; changes in trade, tariffs, including trade relations between the united states and china, and international relations, including the uk's withdrawal from the european union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our transformational cost management program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events; and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates. these and other factors can affect the company's operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. the results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
estimated covid-19 impacts and uncertainties in december 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as covid-19, was reported. the world health organization declared covid-19 a "public health emergency of international concern" on january 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on march 11, 2020. covid-19 has severely impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the economies of the u.s., the uk and other countries around the world. covid-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations. further, financial and credit markets have experienced and may again experience volatility and turmoil. policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid-19 have resulted in, among other things, temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in u.s., uk and other countries, reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of work-from-home policies.
covid-19 adversely affected global economic conditions in fiscal 2020 and the company expects this will continue into fiscal 2021 and possibly longer. the situation surrounding covid-19 remains fluid, and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with customers, government officials, team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as developments in our business. as covid-19 impacts the economies of the u.s. and other countries around the world, the company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to maintain continuity of our operations, while also taking steps to keep our team members healthy and safe.

during the fiscal 2020, we experienced certain adverse impacts of covid-19, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2020. sales were adversely impacted with the majority of the decline within the retail pharmacy international division, reflecting a significant reduction in footfall in boots uk stores, particularly in major high street, train stations and airport locations due to government restrictions. footfall did, however, improve steadily in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. while most boots stores remained open throughout the uk lockdown to provide communities with pharmacy and essential healthcare, our largest premium beauty and fragrance counters were effectively closed. during the three months ended may 31, 2020, more than 100 boots stores, mainly in high street, train stations and airport locations, were temporarily closed as were nearly all of the 600 boots opticians stores. globally pharmacy volume was impacted by a decline in doctor visits and hospital patient admissions in the third quarter. however, trends improved in the three months ended august 31, 2020 in new to therapy scripts compared to the prior quarter. additionally, retail gross margin was adversely impacted by sales mix, with a shift from higher margin discretionary categories to lower margin essential categories, and by higher supply chain costs. the company took measures to keep stores open during covid-19, incurring incremental selling, general and administrative expenses, including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning. operating income was significantly and adversely impacted as a result of the foregoing factors. in addition, due to the significant impact of covid-19 on the financial performance of the retail pharmacy international division, the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain intangibles in boots uk, which resulted in the recording of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $2.0 billion during the three months ended may 31, 2020.
in an effort to strengthen our liquidity position while navigating covid-19, we have taken a number of proactive steps since march 2020, including the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt securities, entry into new and extended credit facilities, establishing a euro commercial paper program and suspending activity under our 2018 stock repurchase program, as described in liquidity and capital resources below.
in response to covid-19, various domestic and foreign federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives have been implemented designed to reduce the transmission of covid-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from covid-19. the company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the company. it has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the cares act in the u.s. and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the uk, and may continue to do so in the future.
the company has also taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives, such as digital 'order ahead' drive-thru with an increased range of products available for drive-thru pick-up, and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the u.s. to continue to work with customers and manage through the pandemic, the company has launched a new covid-19 testing program for businesses and also completed more than two million covid-19 tests across the us and uk. the company also took certain actions during fiscal 2020 to partly mitigate the impact of covid-19 through cost containment across the company including temporary store closures, furloughing approximately 16,000 uk employees at the peak of the crisis, decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations.
as a result of covid-19, a portion of our global workforce, including employees and extended workforce, rapidly shifted to a working from home environment beginning in march 2020 and many continue to work remotely. while our system of internal controls were not specifically designed and implemented to accommodate for this shift, we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the company's internal control over financial reporting during the second half of fiscal 2020 as described in item 9a. controls and procedures below. the company will continue to monitor and assess the covid-19 situation and its internal controls and seek to mitigate any impact on their design and operating effectiveness.
the company anticipates additional mandates and directives, including revisions thereto, from foreign, federal, state, county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the covid-19 pandemic and for some time thereafter. the impact of this activity on the u.s. and global economies and consumer, customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments. as a result, the financial and/or operational impact these covid-19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the collective impact could be material and adverse.
we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid-19 on our business and geographies, including how it is impacting our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. however, the future impact that covid-19 will have on our financial position and operating results may be affected by numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, governmental, business or other actions, impacts on our supply chain, the effect on customer demand, store closures or changes to our operations. the health of our workforce, and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, distribution facilities, wholesale operations and other critical functions cannot be predicted and is vital to our operations. the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to,
- 37 -
and volatility in, the credit and financial markets and consumer spending, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown. further, additional waves of covid-19 in fiscal 2021 or beyond would cause many of the impacts described herein to return or be exacerbated. in addition, we cannot predict with certainty the impact that covid-19 will have on our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us.
for further information, please see item 1a, risk factors in this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. the company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements", and in item 1a, risk factors, in this report.
u.s. recent events during the fiscal 2020, significant looting impacted certain stores with varying degrees of damage throughout the united states. as a result, the company recognized $68 million charge during the fiscal 2020 for estimated store damage and inventory losses, net of insurance recoveries. the resulting store closures adversely affected sales.
store damage and inventory losses related to these recent events are recognized as the costs are incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). the company treats these charges as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.
the impact of brexit following the june 2016 advisory referendum, the united kingdom withdrew from the european union ("brexit") on january 31, 2020. it began a transition period until december 31, 2020 in which to negotiate a new trading relationship for goods and services. failure to complete negotiations by the deadline could result in the united kingdom becoming subject to trade agreements with the european union that are less favorable than those currently in effect. in addition, since the referendum, there has been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market condition in the united kingdom. given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will have on our business, particularly united kingdom and other european operations; however, brexit and its related effects could have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position or operating results. for more information relating to this topic, see "risk factors-our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks."

the company currently estimates that the transformational cost management program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. the company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the transformational cost management program will result in future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, it transformation and lease and other real estate payments.

selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.1% in fiscal 2020 compared to 18.6% in fiscal 2019. as a percentage of sales, expenses were lower in the current period primarily due to savings related to the transformational cost management program and gains on sale-leaseback transactions partially offset by costs related to the company's transformational cost management program and year-on-year bonus impact.
adjusted operating income (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019
retail pharmacy usa division's adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 22.0% to $4.1 billion. the decrease was primarily due to lower pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure, and covid-19 adverse impacts partially offset by a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.

instruments and plans complying with rule 10b5-1. see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 10, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. the company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:
business combinations - the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, the company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.
leases - the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. the lease classification is determined at the commencement date. right-of-use assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. the commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the company has the right to control the property. the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. the incremental borrowing rate is based on the company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. the operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.
the lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there is significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the company's economic and strategic initiatives. short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.
the company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. these are expensed as incurred. the company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that
- 56 -
includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. the company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.
finance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. as part of the company's impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. the determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.
during the three months ended may 31, 2020, the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to its two reporting units within retail pharmacy international division, boots and other international, as a result of the significant impact of covid-19 on their financial performance. based on this analysis, the company recorded impairment charges of $1.7 billion on boots goodwill and $0.3 billion on certain indefinite-lived boots tradename assets.
based on the annual evaluation as of june 1, 2020 valuation date, the fair values of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4% to approximately 239% excluding boots reporting unit for which the excess of fair value over carrying amount was nominal due to an impairment charge recognized during the three months ended may 31, 2020. other international reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 4% compared to 16% on june 1, 2019. as of august 31, 2020, the carrying values of goodwill were $1.1 billion and $0.5 billion for boots reporting unit and other international reporting unit, respectively. the fair values of certain indefinite-lived intangibles within the boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4% to approximately 31%, excluding certain indefinite-lived boots tradename assets for which the excess of fair values over carrying amounts were nominal due to impairment charges recognized during the three months ended may 31, 2020. as of august 31, 2020, the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangibles within the boots reporting unit was $7.2 billion. during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, the company recorded an impairment of $73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the boots reporting unit.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions including the business and financial performance of the company's reporting units, as well as how such performance may be impacted by covid-19. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures, including considering the impact of covid-19.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, including the impact of covid-19, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of covid-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability. the company will continue to monitor these potential impacts, including the impact of covid-19 and economic, industry and market trends and the impact these may have on boots and other international reporting units.
the company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the company's fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. this comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.

see note 6, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
impairment of long lived assets - the company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. the evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. long-lived assets related to the company's retail operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. if the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. fair value of the asset group is generally determined using income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.
the determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.
cost of sales and inventory - cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. in addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.
cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and primarily on a first-in first-out ("fifo") basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments.
equity method investments - the company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. the company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company's ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.
the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. factors considered by the company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. an impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.
pension and postretirement benefits - the company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-u.s. employees. the company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying u.s. employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.
in determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $438.8 million to the company's pension benefit obligation. a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the company's pension expense by $23.7 million.
the company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. the postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.
income taxes -the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of
- 58 -
limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the company's consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in its consolidated statements of earnings.
in determining its provision for income taxes, the company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. the provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the united states. discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

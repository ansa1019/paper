risk factors we are dependent on the leadership of our chief executive officer and other executive officers and key employees.
the success of our business and the ability to execute our strategy are highly dependent on the efforts of mr.
zubretsky, our chief executive officer, and our other key executive officers and employees. the loss of their leadership, expertise, and experience could negatively impact our operations. our ability to replace them or any other key employee may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the healthcare industry who have the breadth and depth of skills and experience necessary to operate and lead a business such as ours. competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain, or motivate these personnel. if we are unsuccessful in recruiting, retaining, managing, and motivating such personnel, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.
we face claims related to litigation which could result in substantial monetary damages.
we are subject to a variety of legal actions, including provider claims, employment related disputes, healthcare regulatory law-based litigation and enforcement actions, breach of contract actions, qui tam or false claims act actions, and securities class actions. if we incur liability materially in excess of the amount for which we have insurance coverage, our profitability would suffer. even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit, we may have to defend ourselves against such claims. the defense of any such actions may be time-
consuming and costly, and may distract our management's attention. such legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
because our corporate headquarters are located in southern california, our business operations may be significantly disrupted as a result of a major earthquake or wildfire.
our corporate headquarters are located in long beach, california. in addition, some of our health plans' claims are processed in long beach, california. southern california is exposed to a statistically greater risk of a major earthquake and wildfires than most other parts of the united states. if a major earthquake or wildfire were to strike southern california, our corporate functions and claims processing could be significantly impaired for a substantial period of time. if there is a major southern california earthquake or wildfire, there can be no assurances that our disaster recovery plan will be successful or that the business operations of our health plans, including those that are remote from any such event, would not be substantially impacted.
failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and stock price, and could subject us to sanctions by regulatory authorities.
a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the past, which have subsequently been remediated. if additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.

properties we own and lease certain real properties to support the business operations of our reportable segments. while we believe our current and anticipated facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs in the near term, we continually evaluate the adequacy of our properties for our anticipated future needs.
legal proceedings kentucky rfp. on september 4, 2020, anthem kentucky managed care plan, inc. brought an action in franklin county circuit court against the kentucky finance and administration cabinet, the kentucky cabinet for health and family services and all of the winning bidder health plans, including molina healthcare of kentucky, inc., civil action no. 20-ci-00719. in its action, anthem requested that the court disqualify molina healthcare of kentucky, find that the kentucky rfp scoring was erroneous and violated procedures or was arbitrary and capricious, set aside the contract awards and conduct a new rfp evaluation process, and award injunctive relief, including stopping the implementation of the contracts awarded under the rfp. on september 28, 2020, the court issued a temporary restraining order preserving the status quo, and on october 23, 2020, the court issued a temporary injunction directing that the rfp readiness review and open enrollment proceed with six health plans, including both anthem and molina healthcare.
on december 22, 2020, the court granted a motion by unitedhealthcare of kentucky ltd. to assert a cross-claim against the kentucky cabinet for health and family services, which sought in part a disqualification of anthem or molina healthcare and a declaratory judgment that the kentucky medicaid program proceed with only five health plans. on december 23, 2020, humana health plan, inc. brought a separate action against the commonwealth of kentucky and the winning bidder health plans, including molina healthcare of kentucky, civil action 20-ci-00987. on january 11, 2021, both actions were consolidated before the franklin county circuit court. humana requests a declaratory judgment finding that the commonwealth violated the medicaid contract by allocating passport members to molina healthcare for 2021 so that passport members would instead be allocated to humana and other winning health plans, or, in the alternative, monetary damages from the commonwealth.
molina healthcare believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims of anthem, united, and humana, and intends to vigorously defend its position, including its twice being a winning bidder of the kentucky medicaid rfp, and its protection of the continuity of care for passport medicaid members. this matter remains subject to significant additional legal proceedings, and no assurances can be given regarding the ultimate outcome. under the court's temporary injunction, molina healthcare of kentucky continues to operate under its contract and provide care to kentucky medicaid members.

stock trading symbol and dividends our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the trading symbol "moh." as of february 12, 2021, there were 12 registered holders of record of our common stock, including cede & co. to date we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock. we currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund our projected business operations. however, we intend to periodically evaluate our cash position to determine whether to pay a cash dividend in the future. our ability to pay dividends is partially dependent on, among other things, our receipt of cash dividends from our regulated subsidiaries. the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is limited by the state departments of insurance in the states in which we operate or may operate, as well as requirements of the government-sponsored health programs in which we participate. additionally, the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes and credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and contractual and regulatory restrictions. for more information regarding restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, please see the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions."

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a")
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, are presented in the sections that follow. our md&a as of and for the year ended december 31, 2018, may be found in our 2019 annual report on form 10-k, which prior disclosure is incorporated by reference herein.
overview molina healthcare, inc., a fortune 500 company, provides managed healthcare services under the medicaid and medicare programs, and through the state insurance marketplaces (the "marketplace"). through our locally operated health plans in 15 states, we served approximately 4.0 million members as of december 31, 2020. in addition, in connection with our acquisition of magellan complete care on december 31, 2020, we added approximately 200,000
members, and now operate health plans in 18 states. these health plans are generally operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states, and licensed as health maintenance organizations ("hmos").
2020 highlights highlights of our 2020 results included the following:
• net income per diluted share of $11.23, with net income of $673 million;
• total revenue of $19.4 billion, which increased 15% compared to 2019;
• premium revenue of $18.3 billion, which increased 13% compared to 2019;
• consolidated medical care ratio ("mcr") of 86.5%, compared to 85.8% in 2019;
• we estimate the net effect of covid decreased net income for the full year 2020 by $2.30 per diluted share, and increased the mcr by approximately 50 basis points;
• results were positively impacted by certain non-recurring and other items, mainly including the proceeds from the marketplace risk corridor judgment;
• membership, including magellan complete care, increased approximately 900,000 members to 4.2 million at december
31, 2020. roughly half of this increase was from our recent acquisitions of magellan complete care, passport in kentucky and yourcare in new york, with the balance from suspension of medicaid redeterminations noted below;
• general and administrative expense ratio ("g&a ratio") of 7.6%, compared to 7.7% in 2019; and
• after-tax margin of 3.5%, despite the underperformance of our marketplace business.
covid impacts as noted above, the combined net effect of covid-related impacts reduced our 2020 earnings and included:
• a decrease in medical costs due to covid-related utilization curtailment throughout most of year of approximately
$420 million, which was partially offset by direct care related to covid patients;
• premium refunds and related actions enacted by a number of our state customers in response to the covid-related utilization curtailment of approximately $564 million, including $401 million recognized in the fourth quarter, mostly associated with recently-enacted risk sharing corridors;
• an increase in our g&a spending on activities related to covid; and
• membership growth due to suspension of redeterminations in medicaid.
growth initiatives we made major strides in 2020 related to our growth strategy. on december 31, 2020, we closed on the acquisition of magellan complete care. in september 2020, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase the net assets of affinity health plan in new york, which we expect to close as early as the second quarter of 2021. we closed on the passport acquisition in kentucky on september 1, 2020, and we closed on the yourcare acquisition in upstate new york on july
1, 2020. each of these acquisitions involve financially underperforming health plans, but with stable membership and revenue bases. we believe they provide attractive opportunities for margin improvement, operating leverage and membership growth. our growth initiatives continue to be anchored by our capital allocation priorities: first, organic growth; second, inorganic growth through accretive acquisitions; and third, programmatically returning excess capital to shareholders.
in summary, we continue to perform well, our fundamentals remain strong, and we continue to grow revenue as a result of our focus on top-line growth.

consolidated results net income and operating income net income amounted to $673 million, or $11.23 per diluted share in 2020, compared with net income of $737 million, or $11.47 per diluted share, in 2019. our after-tax margin decreased to 3.5% for 2020, compared to 4.4% for 2019.
operating income was $1,078 million in 2020, compared with $1,044 million in 2019. we estimate that the net effect of covid-19 decreased pretax income in 2020 by approximately $180 million, or $2.30 per diluted share. operating income increased in 2020, despite the net effect of covid-19, due to growth in membership and premiums, and a $128
million legal judgment for marketplace risk corridor claims related to prior years, partially offset by a year-
over-year decline in the underlying performance of our marketplace business.
net income per share in 2020 was favorably impacted by the reduction in common shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs in 2020. see further discussion and information in "liquidity and financial condition," below, and in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 3, "net income per share."
premium revenue premium revenue increased $2,091 million, or 13%, in 2020, when compared with 2019.
the higher premium revenues reflect increased membership, primarily in medicaid, and include the impact from the yourcare and passport acquisitions. in 2020, we added 337,000 members from our acquisition of the kentucky passport business on september 1, 2020, and 47,000 members from our acquisition of the new york yourcare business on july 1,
2020. suspension of redeterminations in medicaid was also a driver for membership growth in 2020.
the increase in premium revenues from these acquisitions was slightly offset by the decline in membership associated with our exit of operations in puerto rico in 2020. the increase in premium revenue was net of approximately $564 million recognized for covid-related premium refunds and related actions that were enacted in several states in response to lower utilization of medical services resulting from covid-19.
medical care ratio the consolidated mcr in 2020 increased to 86.5%, compared to 85.8% in 2019, primarily due to the unfavorable net effect of covid-19 impacts in all our lines of business. we estimate that the net effect of covid-19 increased our consolidated mcr in 2020 by approximately 50 basis points.
prior year reserve development in 2020 was not material. the year ended december 31, 2019, was positively impacted by 80 basis points of favorable reserve development, primarily in the medicaid program.
premium tax revenue and expenses the premium tax ratio increased to 3.4% in 2020, compared with 2.9% in 2019. the current year ratio increase was mainly due to the state of illinois' implementation of a managed care organization provider assessment in the third quarter of 2019. additionally, the state of california implemented a new managed care organization assessment, effective january 1, 2020, after the prior assessment mechanism expired on june 30, 2019.
health insurer fees ("hif")
in 2020, hif expense amounted to $277 million and hif reimbursements amounted to $271 million. public law no.
115-120 provided for a hif moratorium in 2019; therefore, there was no hif incurred or reimbursed in that year. due to the reinstatement of the hif in 2020, our effective tax rate was higher in 2020 compared with 2019.
the further consolidated appropriations act, 2020, repealed the hif effective for years after 2020.
investment income and other revenue investment income and other revenue decreased to $76 million in 2020, compared with $132 million in 2019. the year-
over-year decrease was consistent with our expectation and was due to the low interest rate environment.

held §1342 of the affordable care act obligated the federal government to pay participating insurers the full marketplace risk corridor amounts calculated by that statute. we received the judgment in october 2020 and, consistent with the timing of the cash receipt, the gain was recognized in our fourth quarter 2020 financial results and reported in "marketplace risk corridor judgment" in our consolidated statements of income. the judgment did not create additional minimum mlr rebates.
general and administrative ("g&a") expenses the g&a expense ratio decreased slightly to 7.6% in 2020 compared with 7.7% in 2019, due to increased revenues, partially offset by increased costs associated with the covid-19 pandemic, due to added operational protocols, technology implementations, and benefits for our employees, and also from increased costs associated with acquisitions.
interest expense interest expense increased to $102 million in 2020, compared with $87 million in 2019. additional interest expense relating to the 4.375% notes issued in june 2020, and the 3.875% notes issued in november 2020, was partially offset by the decrease in interest expense resulting from the settlement of the convertible senior notes in january
2020. as further described below in "liquidity," a portion of the net proceeds from the 4.375% notes offering was used to repay $600 million principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility of our prior credit agreement.
additionally, a portion of the net proceeds from the 3.875% notes offering was used to repay the $330 million principal amount outstanding under the 4.875% notes.
other expenses (income), net in 2020, we recognized losses on debt repayment of $15 million in connection with repayment of our term loan facility and other financing transactions. in 2019, we recognized a gain on debt repayment of $15 million, in connection with convertible senior notes repayment transactions.
income taxes income tax expense amounted to $288 million in 2020, or 30.0% of pretax income, compared with income tax expense of
$235 million in 2019, or 24.2% of the pretax income. the effective tax rate was higher in 2020 due to higher nondeductible expenses in 2020, primarily related to the nondeductible hif. as discussed above, the hif was not applicable in 2019 and has been repealed for years after 2020.
reportable segments as of december 31, 2020, we had two reportable segments: the health plans segment, and the other segment. our reportable segments are consistent with how we currently manage the business and view the markets we serve.
how we assess performance we derive our revenues primarily from health insurance premiums. our primary customers are state medicaid agencies and the federal government.
the key metrics used to assess the performance of our health plans segment are premium revenue, margin and mcr. mcr represents the amount of medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue. therefore, the underlying margin, or the amount earned by the health plans segment after medical costs are deducted from premium revenue, is the most important measure of earnings reviewed by management.
margin for our health plans segment is also referred to as "medical margin." medical margin amounted to $2.5
billion and $2.3 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively for the health plans segment. management's discussion and analysis of the changes in medical margin is discussed below under "financial performance."
see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 16, "segments," for more information.

health plans as of december 31, 2020, the health plans segment consisted of health plans operating in 15 states, and served approximately 4.0 million members eligible for medicaid, medicare, and other government-sponsored healthcare programs for low-income families and individuals, including marketplace members, most of whom receive government premium subsidies. in addition, in connection with our acquisition of magellan complete care on december 31, 2020, we added approximately 200,000 members, and now operate health plans in 18 states.
the health plans reportable segment includes our regulated health plan operating segments, along with the recently acquired magellan complete care health plans operating segment. because this acquisition closed on december 31,
2020, magellan complete care's operating results were insignificant to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020.
trends and uncertainties for a discussion of the health plans segment's trends, uncertainties and other developments, refer to "item 1.
business-our business," "-covid-19 pandemic," and "-legislative and political environment."

as discussed above, the combination of all the covid-19 pandemic-related impacts decreased pretax income in 2020
and increased our consolidated mcr in 2020 by approximately 50 basis points. some of these items increased earnings, such as lower than expected medical costs from the curtailment of utilization that benefited all our state health plans, and a meaningful increase in medicaid membership, while others served to decrease earnings, such as the temporary, retroactive medicaid premium refunds and related actions enacted by certain states.
comments relating to the performance of our health plans in california, ohio, texas and washington, which represent our largest health plans from a premium revenue standpoint, follow:
california. for the year ended december 31, 2020, medical margin declined when compared with 2019, as the lower medical care costs from the curtailment of utilization were more than offset by retroactive medicaid premium refunds and underperformance in the marketplace program.

net effects of covid-19 had an unfavorable impact on medical margins in all programs in 2020, as the retroactive premium refunds exceeded the benefit from lower medical costs due to the curtailment of utilization.
texas. for the year ended december 31, 2020, premium revenues and medical margin were both slightly higher when compared with 2019. medical margin increased due to higher premium revenues and a lower mcr in medicaid, mostly driven by curtailment of utilization related to covid-19 premiums, partially offset by underperformance in marketplace. the decline in marketplace resulted mainly from lower premiums and higher acuity mix for the new members we served.
washington. for the year ended december 31, 2020, medical margin was higher when compared with 2019, mainly due to improved results in medicaid. medicaid premium revenues increased in the year ended december 31, 2020, due to membership growth. in addition, results in the year ended december 31, 2020, benefited modestly from lower medical costs due to the curtailment of utilization driven by covid-19, which was partially offset by covid-related provider payments mandated by the state in the second quarter of 2020.

medicaid medicaid premium revenue increased $1,799 million in 2020, when compared with 2019, mainly due to membership growth and premium increases in several states, and the impact from suspension of redeterminations due to covid-19.
excluding acquisitions and our planned exit from puerto rico, we have added approximately 415,000 new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations. these premium increases were partially offset by premium refunds and related actions enacted in several states in response to the lower utilization of medical services stemming from covid-19.
the medical margin of our medicaid program increased $307 million, or 21%, in 2020 when compared with 2019. the increase was driven by increased premium revenues and margin associated with the membership growth discussed above, and from a reduction in the mcr.
the medicaid mcr decreased to 87.4% in 2020, from 88.0% in 2019, or 60 basis points. the decrease in the medicaid mcr in 2020 was due to improvements across all programs. the mcr benefited from operational improvements and premium increases in several states, but was partially offset by unfavorable effects of covid-19, including the impact of the premium refunds and related actions, net of lower medical costs due to the curtailment of utilization.
in the third quarter of 2020, we recognized a $10 million premium deficiency reserve ("pdr") associated with the puerto rico medicaid business. we exited this business on october 31, 2020. the pdr represents the estimated remaining claims and administrative costs that exceed the estimated remaining premiums associated with the contract.
these improvements were partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year changes in prior year reserve development.
prior year reserve development in 2020 was not material; however, 2019 was positively impacted by 100 basis points of favorable reserve development.
medicare medicare premium revenue increased $269 million in 2020, when compared with 2019, primarily due to increases in premium revenue pmpm and member months. pmpms improved due to increased revenue resulting from risk scores that are more commensurate with the acuity of our population and increases in quality incentive premium revenues. these increases were partially offset by premium refunds, mainly in mmp, enacted in response to the lower utilization of medical services stemming from covid-19.

the medical margin for medicare increased $21 million, or 6%, in 2020 when compared with 2019, primarily due to the increase in premium revenue discussed above, partially offset by increases in medical costs pmpm.
the medicare mcr increased from 85.3% in 2019 to 86.0% in 2020, or 70 basis points. the increase was primarily driven by an increase in medical care costs pmpm, which was mainly attributed to unfavorable changes in member mix, including higher acuity populations. the medical cost pmpm also reflected modestly lower utilization of medical services stemming from covid-19. the impact of increased medical costs on the mcr was partially offset by the increase in the premium revenue pmpm discussed above.
marketplace marketplace premium revenue increased $23 million in 2020, when compared with 2019, mainly due to increased membership, partially offset by a decrease in premium revenue pmpm. the decrease in premium revenue pmpm was mainly driven by lower pricing, in an effort to be more competitive and generate membership growth, and the impact of more health plans being subject to minimum medical loss ratio rebates when compared with the prior year. the factors decreasing premium revenue pmpm were partially offset by the impact of higher risk adjustment premiums, resulting from higher acuity of our membership.
the marketplace medical margin decreased $152 million in 2020, despite the increase in premium revenues, due to an increase in the mcr compared to 2019.
the marketplace mcr increased to 78.7% in 2020, compared to 68.2% in 2019. the increase in mcr was driven by the impact of the decrease in premium revenue pmpm discussed above, combined with an increase in medical cost pmpm when compared with 2019. the higher medical cost pmpm was primarily due to a higher member acuity mix and increased medical costs related to covid-19. the rebound in utilization for marketplace, following the curtailment from covid-19, has been much more pronounced than our medicaid and medicare programs. additionally, our risk scores, though increased compared to 2019, continue to lag the acuity of our membership.
other the other segment includes certain corporate amounts not allocated to the health plans segment. in 2020 and 2019, such amounts were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations.
liquidity and financial condition liquidity we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.
we maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company. our regulated health plan subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue and net income. such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity. thus, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. we generally receive premium revenue a short time before we pay for the related healthcare services. the majority of the assets held by our regulated health plan subsidiaries is in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. the regulated health plan subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent company amounting to $635
million in 2020, and $1,373 million in 2019, respectively. the parent company contributed capital of $107 million and $43 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements.
cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to $644 million and $997 million as of december 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. the decrease in 2020 was mainly due to cash used for magellan complete care and other acquisitions, and common stock repurchases. these outflows were partially offset by inflows from net debt financing transactions, and dividends received from regulated health plan subsidiaries, net of contributions, as described above. see further discussion below, in "investing activities," and "financing activities."

investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board-approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than
10 years, or less than 10 years average life for structured securities. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels.
we believe that the risks of the covid-19 pandemic, as they relate to our investments, are minimal. the overall rating of our portfolio remains strong and is rated aa. our investment policy has directives in conjunction with state guidelines to minimize risks and exposures in volatile markets. additionally, our portfolio managers assist us in navigating the current volatility in the capital markets.
our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, and u.s. treasury securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. all of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets.
cash flow activities our cash flows are summarized as follows:

cash equivalents operating activities we typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government payors may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. for example, government payors may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month's premium payment.
net cash provided by operations was $1,890 million in 2020, compared with $427 million of net cash provided in
2019. the $1,463 million increase in year-over-year cash flow was due to cash flow timing benefits from the growth in membership in 2020, and the net impact of timing differences in governmental receivables and payables.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $400 million in 2020, compared with $293 million of net cash used in
2019, a decrease in year-over-year cash flow of $107 million. the decrease was mainly attributable to net cash paid in the yourcare, passport and magellan complete care acquisitions, partially offset by decreased purchases of investments in 2020.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $225 million in 2020, compared with $552 million of net cash used in
2019, an increase in year-over-year cash flow of $777 million. in 2020, cash inflows included $1,429 million from the issuance of the 4.375% and 3.875% notes and $380 million borrowed under the term loan facility. cash outflows included the $600 million repayment of the term loan facility, common stock purchases of $606 million, which included $7 million to settle shares purchased in late december 2019, and net cash paid for the aggregate convertible senior notes ‐ related transactions amounting to $42 million. in 2019, cash outflows included net cash paid for the aggregate convertible senior notes-related transactions of $754 million, and $47 million paid for common stock purchases, partially offset by proceeds of $220 million borrowed under the term loan facility.

financial condition we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our credit agreement as discussed further below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future sources," and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, as of december 31, 2020, our working capital was $2,911 million compared with $2,698
million as of december 31, 2019. at december 31, 2020, our cash and investments amounted to $6,165 million, compared with $4,477 million of cash and investments at december 31, 2019.
because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plans to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. for more information, see the "liquidity"
discussion presented above.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions each of our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulations. such statutes, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions, loans or advances that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement for these subsidiaries (not including the magellan complete care subsidiaries) was estimated to be approximately $1,310
million at december 31, 2020, compared with $1,110 million at december 31, 2019. we estimate the magellan complete care subsidiaries' minimum capital and surplus requirement amounted to approximately $230 million at december 31,
2020. the aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of both dates.
under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of december 31, 2020, was approximately $60 million in the aggregate. the subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities.
based on our cash and investments balances as of december 31, 2020, management believes that its regulated wholly owned subsidiaries remain well capitalized and exceed their regulatory minimum requirements. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with statutory capital and surplus requirements.
debt ratings each of our high-yield senior notes is rated "bb-" by standard & poor's, and "ba3" by moody's investor service, inc. a downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs.
financial covenants the credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. such ratios are computed as defined by the terms of the credit agreement.
in addition, the indentures governing each of our outstanding high-yield senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. as of december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement and other long-term debt.
future sources and uses of liquidity future sources our health plans segment regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which is generally received a short time before related healthcare services are paid. premium revenue is our primary source of liquidity. thus, any decline in the receipt of premium revenue, and our profitability, could have a negative impact on our liquidity.

potential impact of covid-19 pandemic . excluding acquisitions and our planned exit from puerto rico, we have added approximately 415,000 new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations.
it remains unclear how high the covid-related membership peak will be, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers, and where it will ultimately settle. however it does now appear that since unemployment nationally has fallen to 6.3% as of january 2021, the initial industry estimates of unemployment-related medicaid membership increases were somewhat overstated. on a related note, the declaration of the extension of the public health emergency period to april 2021, with a potential extension from the biden administration for the public health emergency to remain in place for all of 2021, will also likely have an impact. therefore, we are currently unable to predict the timing or amount of the expected increases in enrollment. increased membership would increase our premium revenue, but would also likely result in a significant increase in medical care claims and related costs.
we believe that we have the scalability necessary to both serve new members, and ably partner with our state customers for increases in membership.
dividends from subsidiaries. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, state regulators could restrict the ability of our regulated health plan subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company, which could reduce the liquidity of the parent company. for more information on our regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions, refer to notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions," and note 17, "condensed financial information of registrant-note c - dividends and capital contributions."
credit agreement borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2020, we had available borrowing capacity of $1 billion under the revolving credit facility of our credit agreement. in addition, the credit agreement provides for a $15
million swingline sub-facility and a $100 million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions up to $500 million, plus an unlimited amount of such term loans as long as we maintain a minimum consolidated net leverage ratio. see further discussion in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."
future uses common stock purchases. in september 2020, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this program is funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31, 2021.
the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. following the purchases completed under a rule 10b5-1 trading plan from november 2020 through february 11, 2021, there is approximately $219 million remaining available to purchase our common stock through december 31, 2021. see further information in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 13,
"stockholders' equity."
acquisitions . we have a disciplined and steady approach to growth. organic growth, which includes leveraging our existing health plan portfolio and winning new territories, is our highest priority. in addition to organic growth, we will consider targeted acquisitions that are a strategic fit that we believe will leverage operational synergies, and lead to incremental earnings accretion. for further information on our acquisitions, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations."
in september 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all the assets of affinity health plan, inc. the net purchase price for the transaction is approximately $380 million, subject to various adjustments at closing, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. we currently expect the transaction to close as early as the second quarter of 2021.
in september 2020, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of passport health plan, inc. the purchase consideration included estimated contingent consideration of approximately $46 million as of december 31, 2020.
half this amount is payable later in 2021, with the remainder payable in early 2022, subject to review and agreement among us and the seller. the second half payment is contingent upon the outcome of certain legal challenges.

outcome of aca litigation. as described above in "health plans segment-trends and uncertainties," the u.s. supreme court has accepted the appeal of the fifth circuit court's decision regarding the constitutionality and severability of the individual mandate. the aca remains in effect pending the issuance of the supreme court's opinion. a decision by the supreme court that the entirety of the aca is unconstitutional could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.
potential impact of covid-19 pandemic . beginning in early 2020 the pandemic, along with the related quarantine and social distancing measures, reduced demand for certain routine and non-critical medical services, while at the same time increased demand for other medical services, such as covid-19 testing and emergency services. in 2020, utilization was curtailed, but could rebound to more normal levels in 2021. increased demand for medical services, which we are presently unable to predict the timing or magnitude, could result in a significant increase in medical care costs and related provider claims payments.
also, as described above in "item 1. business-covid-19 pandemic," we have been subject to premium refunds and related actions as a result of the pandemic. in 2020, various states enacted temporary premium refunds and related actions in response to the reduced demand for medical services stemming from covid-19, which resulted in a reduction of our medical margin. in some cases, these premium actions were retroactive to earlier periods in 2020, or as early as the beginning of the states' fiscal years in 2019. beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we have recognized retroactive premium actions that we believe to be probable, and where the ultimate premium amount is reasonably estimable. we recognized $564 million related to these retroactive premium actions, in the aggregate, in
2020.
it is possible that certain states could increase the level of existing premium refunds, and it is also possible that other states could implement some form of retroactive premium refund in the future. due to these uncertainties, the ultimate outcomes could differ materially from our estimates as a result of changes in facts or further developments, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements.
the molina healthcare charitable foundation. in august 2020, we announced our commitment of $150 million to fund the molina healthcare charitable foundation (the "foundation"), an independent not-for-profit charitable foundation. we contributed $15 million to the foundation in the fourth quarter of 2020.
critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates, and some differences could be material.
our most significant accounting estimates, which include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity, include the following:
• medical claims and benefits payable. see discussion below, and refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, notes 2, "significant accounting policies," and 10, "medical claims and benefits payable" for more information.
• contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit. for a discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
• quality incentives. for a discussion of this topic, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note
2, "significant accounting policies."
• business combinations, and goodwill and intangible assets, net. at december 31, 2020, goodwill and intangible assets, net, represented approximately 10% of total assets and 45% of total stockholders' equity, compared with 3%
and 9%, respectively, at december 31, 2019. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2,
"significant accounting policies," note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net."

medical care costs, medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-
service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability.
medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk. ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. we also include an additional reserve to ensure that our overall ibnp liability is sufficient under moderately adverse conditions. we reflect changes in these estimates in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.
the estimation of the ibnp liability requires a significant degree of judgment in applying actuarial methods, determining the appropriate assumptions and considering numerous factors. of those factors, we consider estimated completion factors (measures the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical payment patterns) and the assumed healthcare cost trend (the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. other relevant factors also include, but are not limited to, healthcare service utilization trends, claim inventory levels, changes in membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in medicaid fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date, we mainly use estimated completion factors to estimate the ultimate cost of those claims. completion factors measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical claims payment patterns. we analyze historical claims payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates to claim payment dates to estimate completion factors. the estimated completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claims cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. the difference between the estimated ultimate claims cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents our estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in our ibnp liability .
for claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date, actual claims paid are a less reliable measure of our ultimate cost since a large portion of medical claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been submitted. accordingly, we estimate our ibnp liability for claims incurred during these months based on a blend of estimated completion factors and assumed medical care cost trend. the assumed medical care cost trend represents the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs, which can be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, changes in member demographics, catastrophes and epidemics , and other relevant factors.

magnitude or severity of claims, uncertainties related to our entry into new geographical markets or provision of services to new populations, changes in state-controlled fee schedules, and modifications or upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices. therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.
when subsequent actual claims payments are less than we estimated, we recognize a benefit for favorable prior period development that is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: "prior years" in the table presented in note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable." our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. this provision is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: current year" in the table presented in note 10. assuming stability in the size of our membership, the use of this consistent methodology, during any given period, usually results in the replenishment of reserves at a level that generally offsets the benefit of favorable prior period development in that period. in the case of material growth or decline of membership, replenishment can exceed or fall short of the favorable development, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2020 that would result if we change our completion factors for the fourth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2020, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. the following tables do not include amounts relating to our recent acquisitions of magellan complete care and passport. dollar amounts are in millions.

there are many related factors working in conjunction with one another that determine the accuracy of our estimates, some of which are qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. therefore, we are seldom able to quantify the impact that any single factor has on a change in estimate. given the variability inherent in the reserving process, we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations. as a result, we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimates.
recently issued accounting standards refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that affect us.

contractual obligations in the table below, we present our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2020. some of the amounts included in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.
additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material non-cancelable commitments. we are not a party to off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

inflation we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation. specifically, our health plans try to control medical care costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services.
through these contracted providers, our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services. there can be no assurance, however, that our strategies to mitigate medical care cost inflation will be successful. competitive pressures, new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from healthcare providers and customers, applicable regulations, or other factors may affect our ability to control medical care costs.
compliance costs our health plans are regulated by both state and federal government agencies. regulation of managed care products and healthcare services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. changes in applicable laws and rules occur frequently. compliance with such laws and rules may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of additional systems, procedures and programs that we have not yet identified.

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk relating to changes in interest rates, and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense.
substantially all of our investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase in market interest rates at december 31, 2020, the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately $39
million. declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income.
for further information on fair value measurements and our investment portfolio, please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 5, "fair value measurements," and note 6, "investments."
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based, at our election, on a base rate or other defined rate, plus, in each case, the applicable margin. for further information, see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."

31, 2020. in addition, in connection with our acquisition of magellan complete care on december 31, 2020, we added approximately 200,000members, and now operate health plans in 18states. these health plans are generally operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states, and licensed as health maintenance organizations
("hmos").
our state medicaid contracts typically have terms of threeto five years, contain renewal options exercisable by the state medicaid agency, and allow either the state or the health plan to terminate the contract with or without cause. such contracts are subject to risk of loss in states that issue requests for proposal ("rfp") open to competitive bidding by other health plans. if one of our health plans is not a successful responsive bidder to a state rfp, its contract may not be renewed.
in addition to contract renewal, our state medicaid contracts may be periodically amended to include or exclude certain health benefits (such as pharmacy services, behavioral health services, or long-term care services);
populations such as the aged, blind or disabled; and regions or service areas.
recent developments - health plans segment acquisition of magellan complete care. on december 31, 2020, we closed on our acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity interests of the magellan complete care line of business of magellan health, inc., for total purchase consideration of approximately $ 1,037million. because this acquisition closed on december 31, 2020, magellan complete care's operating results were insignificant to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020. see note 4, "business combinations," for further information.
new york . in september 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all the assets of affinity health plan, inc. the net purchase price for the transaction is approximately $ 380million, subject to various adjustments at closing, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. we currently expect the transaction to close as early as the second quarter of 2021.
in july 2020, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of yourcare health plan, inc. see note 4, "business combinations," for further information.
kentucky. in may 2020, our kentucky health plan was selected as an awardee pursuant to the statewide medicaid managed care rfp issued by the kentucky cabinet for health and family services, department of medicaid services.
the new medicaid contract began on january 1, 2021. in connection with this rfp award, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of passport health plan, inc. ("passport") in september 2020. see note 4, "business combinations," for further information.
texas. in march 2020, the texas health and human services commission ("hhsc") notified our texas health plan that hhsc had upheld our protest and had canceled all previously awarded contracts associated with the re-procurement awards announced in october 2019 for the abd program (known in texas as "star+plus"). in addition, hhsc canceled the pending re-procurement associated with the tanf and chip programs (known in texas as "star/chip"). hhsc has indicated that the star+plus rfp will be posted in late 2021 or early 2022, with awards estimated to be announced in the second quarter of 2022, and start of operations in the fourth quarter of 2023. hhsc has also indicated that the star/chip rfp will be posted in the fourth quarter of 2022, with awards estimated to be announced in late 2022
or early 2023, and start of operations in the third quarter of 2024.
puerto rico . we exited puerto rico's medicaid program when our contract expired on october 31, 2020. we have been working with the regulatory authorities and the provider community to ensure that our former members in puerto rico have reliable continuity of care.

consolidation and presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of molina healthcare, inc., and its subsidiaries. all significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. financial information related to subsidiaries acquired during any year is included only for periods subsequent to their acquisition. in the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results as of the date and for the periods presented have been included; such adjustments consist of normal recurring adjustments.
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from these estimates. principal areas requiring the use of estimates include:
• the determination of medical claims and benefits payable of our health plans segment;
• health plans segment contractual provisions that may limit revenue recognition based upon the costs incurred or the profits realized under a specific contract;
• health plans segment quality incentives that allow us to recognize incremental revenue if certain quality standards are met;
• settlements under risk or savings sharing programs;
• purchase price allocations relating to business combinations, including the determination of contingent consideration;
• the assessment of long-lived and intangible assets, and goodwill, for impairment;
• the determination of reserves for potential absorption of claims unpaid by insolvent providers;
• the determination of reserves for the outcome of litigation;
• the determination of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; and
• the determination of unrecognized tax benefits.
2. significant accounting policies cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible into known amounts of cash and have a maturity of three months or less on the date of purchase. the following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. the restricted cash and cash equivalents presented below are included in "restricted investments" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows investments our investments are principally held in debt securities, which are grouped into two separate categories for accounting and reporting purposes: available-for-sale securities, and held-to-maturity securities. available-for-
sale ("afs") securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses, if any, are recorded in stockholders' equity as other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. held-to-maturity ("htm")
securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and unrealized holding gains or losses are not generally recognized. realized gains and losses and unrealized losses arising from credit-related factors with respect to afs and htm securities are included in the determination of net income. the cost of securities sold is determined using the specific-identification method.
our investment policy requires that all of our investments have final maturities of less than 10years, or less than
10years average life for structured securities. investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase. declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income.

in general, our afs securities are classified as current assets without regard to the securities' contractual maturity dates because they may be readily liquidated. we monitor our investments for credit-related impairment.for comprehensive discussions of the fair value and classification of our investments, see note 5, "fair value measurements," and note 6, "investments."
accrued interest receivable relating to our afs and htm securities is presented within "prepaid expenses and other current assets" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and amounted to $ 10million and $ 12million at december 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. we do not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. instead, we write off accrued interest receivable that has not been collected within 90 days of the interest payment due date. we recognize such write offs as a reversal of interest income. no accrued interest was written off during the year ended december 31, 2020.
receivables receivables consist primarily of premium amounts due from government agencies, which may be subject to potential retroactive adjustments. because substantially all of our receivable amounts are readily determinable and substantially all of our creditors are governmental authorities, our allowance for doubtful accounts is insignificant. any amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged to expense when such determination is made.

business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. as discussed below, the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, or one year after the date of acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded within our consolidated results of operations. refer to note 4, business combinations, and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net,"
for further details.
long-lived assets, including intangible assets long-lived assets consist primarily of property, equipment, capitalized software (see note 7, "property, equipment, and capitalized software, net"), and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions. finite-lived, separately-
identified intangible assets acquired in business combinations are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (such as purchased contract rights and provider contracts). intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are then amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, generally between fiveand 16years.
determining the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, particularly intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset.
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. the most significant intangible asset we typically record in a business combination is contract rights associated with membership assumed. in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible assets, we typically apply the income approach, which discounts the projected future net cash flows using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk associated with such projected future cash flows. the most critical assumptions used in determining the fair value of contract rights include forecasted operating margins and the weighted average cost of capital.

our intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite-lived intangible asset's (or asset group's) carrying value may not be recoverable. consideration is given to a number of potential impairment indicators, including the ability of our health plan subsidiaries to obtain the renewal by amendment of their contracts in each state prior to the actual expiration of their contracts. however, there can be no assurance that these contracts will continue to be renewed. following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, to determine whether an impairment exists, we would compare the carrying amount of a finite-
lived intangible asset with the greater of the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets, or its value under the asset liquidation method. if it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment.refer to note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net," for further details.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if impairment indicators are present. impairment indicators may include experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, significant losses of membership, loss of state funding, loss of state contracts, and other factors. goodwill is impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit (one of our state health plans)
exceeds its estimated fair value. this excess is recorded as an impairment loss and adjusted if necessary for the impact of tax-deductible goodwill. the loss recognized may not exceed the total goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
when testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors, such as industry and market factors, the dynamic economic and political environments in which we operate, cost factors, and changes in overall performance, to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. if our qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we perform the quantitative assessment. we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative assessment. if performing a quantitative assessment, we generally estimate the fair values of our reporting units by applying the income approach, using discounted cash flows.
for the annual impairment test under a quantitative assessment, the base year in the reporting units' discounted cash flows is derived from the annual financial planning cycle, which commences in the fourth quarter of the year.
when computing discounted cash flows, we make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors, and consider what the reporting unit's selling price would be in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. significant assumptions include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about membership, premium rates, healthcare and operating cost trends, contract renewal and the procurement of new contracts, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods, and discount rates. when determining the discount rate, we consider the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit, and the expected rate an outside investor would expect to earn. as part of a quantitative assessment, we may also apply the asset liquidation method to estimate the fair value of individual reporting units, which is computed as total assets minus total liabilities, excluding intangible assets and deferred taxes. finally, we apply a market approach to reconcile the value of our reporting units to our consolidated market value. under the market approach, we consider publicly traded comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples which are used to estimate our reporting units' fair values. the assumptions used are consistent with those used in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. however, if these assumptions differ from actual results, the outcome of our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected.
leases right-of-use ("rou") assets represent our right to use the underlying assets over the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation for lease payments arising from the related leases. rou assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when we believe it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. if applicable, we account for lease and non-lease components within a lease as a single lease component.

the related rou assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and interest expense is recognized using the effective interest method.
the significant majority of our operating leases consist of long-term operating leases for office space. short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) are not recorded as rou assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. for certain leases that represent a portfolio of similar assets, such as a fleet of vehicles, we apply a portfolio approach to account for the related rou assets and liabilities, rather than account for such assets and the related liabilities individually. a nominal number of our lease agreements include rental payments that adjust periodically for inflation. our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
for further information, including the amount and location of the rou assets and lease liabilities recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, see note 8, "leases."
medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-
service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability .
medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk . ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. we also include an additional reserve to ensure that our overall ibnp liability is sufficient under moderately adverse conditions. we reflect changes in these estimates in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.
the estimation of the ibnp liability requires a significant degree of judgment in applying actuarial methods, determining the appropriate assumptions and considering numerous factors. of those factors, we consider estimated completion factors and the assumed healthcare cost trend to be the most critical assumptions. other relevant factors also include, but are not limited to, healthcare service utilization trends, claim inventory levels, changes in membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in medicaid fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. each reporting period, the recognized ibnp liability represents our best estimate of the total amount of unpaid claims incurred as of the balance sheet date using a consistent methodology in estimating our ibnp liability. we believe our current estimates are reasonable and adequate; however, the development of our estimate is a continuous process that we monitor and update as more complete claims payment information and healthcare cost trend data becomes available. actual medical care costs may be less than we previously estimated (favorable development) or more than we previously estimated (unfavorable development), and any differences could be material. any adjustments to reflect favorable development would be recognized as a decrease to medical care costs, and any adjustments to reflect unfavorable development would be recognized as an increase to medical care costs , in the period in which the adjustments are determined.
refer to note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable," for a table presenting the components of the change in our medical claims and benefits payable, for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

premium revenue recognition and amounts due government agencies premium revenue is generated from our health plans segment contracts, for our participation in the medicaid, medicare and marketplace programs. premium revenue is generally received based on per member per month ("pmpm")
rates established in advance of the periods covered. these premium revenues are recognized in the month that members are entitled to receive healthcare services, and premiums collected in advance are deferred. state medicaid programs and the federal medicare program periodically adjust premium rates.
certain components of premium revenue are subject to accounting estimates and are described below, under
"contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit," and "quality incentives."
contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit many of our contracts contain provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit, as described below.
consequently, we recognize premium revenue as it is earned under such provisions. liabilities accrued for premiums to be returned under such provisions are reported in the aggregate as "amounts due government agencies" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. categorized by program, such amounts due government agencies included the following:

medicaid program minimum mlr and medical cost corridors. a portion of our premium revenue may be returned if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs. under certain medical cost corridor provisions, the health plans may receive additional premiums if amounts spent on medical care costs exceed a defined maximum threshold.
profit sharing. our contracts with certain states contain profit sharing provisions under which we refund amounts to the states if our health plans generate profit above a certain specified percentage. in some cases, we are limited in the amount of administrative costs that we may deduct in calculating the refund, if any.
retroactive premium adjustments. state medicaid programs periodically adjust premium rates on a retroactive basis.
in these cases, we adjust our premium revenue in the period in which we determine that the adjustment is probable and reasonably estimable, and is based on our best estimate of the ultimate premium we expect to realize for the period being adjusted.

mmp plans. approximately $ 401million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020, mostly associated with recently enacted risk-sharing corridors.
it is possible that certain states could increase the level of existing premium refunds, and it is also possible that other states could implement some form of retroactive premium refund in the future. due to these uncertainties, the ultimate outcomes could differ materially from our estimates as a result of changes in facts or further developments, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
medicare program risk adjustment. our medicare premiums are subject to retroactive increase or decrease based on the health status of our medicare members (as measured by member risk score). we estimate our members' risk scores and the related amount of medicare revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our knowledge of our members' health status, risk scores and centers for medicare & medicaid services ("cms") practices.
minimum mlr. the affordable care act ("aca") established a minimum annual medical loss ratio ("minimum mlr") of 85%
for medicare. the medical loss ratio represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue. federal regulations define what constitutes medical costs and premium revenue. if the minimum mlr is not met, we may be required to pay rebates to the federal government. we recognize estimated rebates under the minimum mlr as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income.
marketplace program risk corridor judgment. in april 2020, the united states supreme court held that §1342 of the affordable care act obligated the federal government to pay participating insurers the full marketplace risk corridor amounts calculated by that statute, and that impacted insurers may sue the federal government in the u.s. court of federal claims to recover damages for breach of that obligation.in june 2020, the claims court granted us judgment in the amount of $ 128million for 2014, 2015, and 2016 marketplace risk corridor claims, which we received in october
2020. consistent with the timing of the cash receipt, the gain was recognized in our fourth quarter 2020 financial results and reported in "marketplace risk corridor judgment" in our consolidated statements of income. the judgment did not create additional minimum mlr rebates.
risk adjustment. under this program, our health plans' composite risk scores are compared with the overall average risk score for the relevant state and market pool. generally, our health plans will make a risk adjustment payment into the pool if their composite risk scores are below the average risk score (risk adjustment payable), and will receive a risk adjustment payment from the pool if their composite risk scores are above the average risk score
(risk adjustment receivable). we estimate our ultimate premium based on insurance policy year-to-date experience, and recognize estimated premiums relating to the risk adjustment program as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income.as of december 31, 2020, marketplace risk adjustment payables amounted to $
326million and related receivables amounted to $ 20million, for a net payable of $ 306million. as of december 31,
2019, marketplace risk adjustment payables amounted to $ 368million and related receivables amounted to $
63million, for a net payable of $ 305million, which relates primarily to 2019 and prior periods.
minimum mlr. the aca has established a minimum mlr of 80% for the marketplace. if the minimum mlr is not met, we may be required to pay rebates to our marketplace policyholders. the marketplace risk adjustment program is taken into consideration when computing the minimum mlr. we recognize estimated rebates under the minimum mlr as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income.
quality incentives at many of our health plans, revenue ranging from approximately 1% to 4% of certain health plan premiums is earned only if certain performance measures are met. such performance measures are generally found in our medicaid and mmp contracts. as described in note 1, "organization and basis of presentation-use of estimates," recognition of quality incentive premium revenue is subject to the use of estimates.
reinsurance we bear underwriting and reserving risks associated with our health plan subsidiaries. we limit our risk of significant catastrophic losses by maintaining high deductible reinsurance coverage with a highly-rated, unaffiliated insurance company (the "third-party reinsurer"). because we remain liable to our policyholders in the event the third-party reinsurer is unable to pay its portion of the losses, we continually monitor the third-party reinsurer's financial condition, including its ability to maintain high credit ratings. intercompany transactions with our captive are eliminated in consolidation.

we report reinsurance premiums as a reduction to premium revenue, while related reinsurance recoveries are reported as a reduction to medical care costs.reinsurance premiums amounted to $ 9million, $ 17million, and $ 16million for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. reinsurance recoveries amounted to $ 23million, $
18million, and $ 33million for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. reinsurance recoverable of $ 17million, $ 21million, and $ 31million, as of december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, is included in "receivables" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
premium deficiency reserves on loss contracts we assess the profitability of our contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred in the future by reviewing current results and forecasts. for purposes of this assessment, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. a premium deficiency is recognized if anticipated future medical care and administrative costs exceed anticipated future premium revenue, investment income and reinsurance recoveries. in the third quarter of 2020, we recognized a premium deficiency reserve ("pdr") of $ 10million for our medicaid contract in puerto rico, $ 4million of which was amortized in the fourth quarter of 2020 to offset losses the pdr was established to cover. as described in note 1,
"organization and basis of presentation," we exited puerto rico's medicaid program when our contract expired on october 31, 2020. no premium deficiency reserves were recorded as of december 31, 2019.
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. valuation allowances are established when management determines it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.for further discussion and disclosure, see note 12, "income taxes."
taxes based on premiums health insurer fee ("hif"). under the affordable care act, the federal government imposed an annual fee, or excise tax, on health insurers for each calendar year (the "hif").
the hif was allocated to health insurers based on each health insurer's share of net premiums for all u.s. health insurers in the year preceding the assessment, and was not deductible for income tax purposes.our hif liability for
2020 was $ 277million, which was settled in september 2020. public law no. 115-120 provided for a hif moratorium in
2019; therefore, there was no hif incurred or reimbursed in that year. due to the reinstatement of the hif in 2020, our effective tax rate was higher in 2020 compared with 2019. the further consolidated appropriations act, 2020
repealed the hif effective for years after 2020.
premium and use tax. certain of our health plans are assessed a tax based on premium revenue collected. the premium revenues we receive from these states include the premium tax assessment. we have reported these taxes on a gross basis, as premium tax revenue and as premium tax expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and restricted investments. our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents are managed by professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels. our investments consist primarily of investment-grade debt securities with final maturities of less than 10years, or less than 10years average life for structured securities. restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents and u.s. treasury securities. concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited because our payors consist principally of the federal government, and governments of each state in which our health plan subsidiaries operate.
risks and uncertainties our profitability depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage medical care costs. we continually review our medical costs in light of our underlying claims experience and revised actuarial data. however, several factors could adversely affect medical care costs. these factors, which include changes in healthcare practices, inflation, new technologies, major epidemics, natural disasters, and malpractice litigation, are beyond our control and may have an adverse effect on our ability to accurately predict and effectively control medical care costs. costs in excess of those anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

we operate health plans primarily as a direct contractor with the states, and in los angeles county, california, as a subcontractor to another health plan holding a direct contract with the state. we are therefore dependent upon a relatively small number of contracts to support our revenue. the loss of any one of those contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. in addition, our ability to arrange for the provision of medical services to our members is dependent upon our ability to develop and maintain adequate provider networks. our inability to develop or maintain such networks might, in certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
the following table summarizes premium revenue by state health plan for the periods presented:

recent accounting pronouncements adopted credit losses. in june 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update
("asu") 2016-13, financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments , which was subsequently modified by several asus issued in 2018 and 2019. we adopted topic 326
effective january 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective approach. under this method we recognized the cumulative effect of adopting the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on january
1, 2020, which was immaterial.
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted reference rate reform. in march 2020, the fasb issued asu 2020-04, reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting , which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by a change in the reference rate from the london interbank offered rate ("libor") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued, if certain conditions are met. asu 2020-04 is effective immediately and expires after december 31, 2022. we are evaluating the effect of reference rate reform and this guidance on our contracts and other transactions.
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb (including its emerging issues task force), the american institute of certified public accountants, and the securities and exchange commission ("sec") did not have, nor does management expect such pronouncements to have, a significant impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements.

4. business combinations in the last half of 2020, we closed on threebusiness combinations in the health plans segment, consistent with our strategy to grow in our existing markets and expand into new markets. for these transactions, we applied the acquisition method of accounting, where the total purchase price was allocated, or preliminarily allocated, to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values as of the acquisition dates. we expect to complete the final determination of the purchase price allocations as soon as practicable, but no later than one year following the acquisitions' closing dates in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 805, business combinations . measurement period adjustments will be recorded in the period in which they are determined, as if they had been completed at the acquisition date.
acquisition costs amounted to $ 16million in the aggregate for the year ended december 31, 2020, and were recorded as "general and administrative expenses" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
magellan complete care. on december 31, 2020, we closed on our acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity interests of the magellan complete care line of business of magellan health, inc., for total purchase consideration of approximately $ 1,037million. total purchase consideration paid in cash amounted to $ 1,008million, which consisted of the base purchase price of $ 850million, plus approximately $ 158million in preliminary closing adjustments, primarily relating to excess regulatory capital. total purchase consideration also included assumed liabilities of $ 29million.

magellan complete care is a managed care organization serving members in sixstates, including medicaid members in arizona and statewide in virginia, and integrated acute care members in florida. through its senior whole health branded plans, magellan complete care provides fully integrated plans for medicaid and medicare dual beneficiaries in massachusetts, as well as managed long-term care in new york. as of december 31, 2020, magellan complete care served approximately 200,000members in its managed care plans. magellan complete care also provides consultative services to participants who self-direct their care through wisconsin's long-term services and supports ("ltss")
program. for the year ended december 31, 2020, magellan complete care's total 2020 revenue was approximately $
2.9billion.
because this acquisition closed on december 31, 2020, magellan complete care's operating results were insignificant to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020. if we had acquired magellan complete care on january 1, 2019, our total revenue and earnings for the year ended december 31, 2019, would have been approximately $ 19.6billion and $ 772million, respectively, and our total revenue and earnings for the year ended december 31, 2020, would have been approximately $ 22.4billion and $ 833million, respectively. these amounts were computed after adjusting the results of magellan complete care to reflect the additional amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible assets and liabilities had been applied beginning on january 1, 2019, together with the consequential tax effects. the pro forma results do not reflect any anticipated synergies, efficiencies, or other cost savings of the acquisition. accordingly, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not indicative of the results if the acquisition had been completed on january 1, 2020, or january 1, 2019, and is not a projection of future results.
the valuation of the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized because the acquisition closed on december 31, 2020. as a result, provisional estimates have been recorded and are subject to change, primarily for accounts that include the use of estimates, such as medical claims and benefits payable, receivables, amounts due government agencies, certain acquired intangible assets, and certain tax assets and liabilities.
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. such assets include synergies we expect to achieve, such as the use of our existing infrastructure to support the added membership, and future economic benefits arising from the assembled workforce.
approximately 27% of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. the following table summarizes the provisional fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

members. the total purchase price was $ 66million, which included our initial cash payment of $ 20million in september 2020, plus $ 46million in contingent consideration payable to the seller. see further information regarding contingent consideration in note 5, "fair value measurements." we recorded goodwill of $ 30million, all of which is deductible for income tax purposes. the goodwill recorded relates to future economic benefits arising from the assembled workforce, and the future growth associated with the member contract rights that are incremental to the contract rights identified.
new york. on july 1, 2020, we closed on the acquisition of certain assets of yourcare health plan, inc., a medicaid health plan operating in certain regions of new york, for a cash purchase price of $ 42million. as a result of this transaction, we added approximately 47,000medicaid members in new york. we recorded goodwill of $ 31million, substantially all of which is deductible for income tax purposes. the goodwill recorded relates to future economic benefits arising from expected synergies to be achieved, including the use of our existing infrastructure to support the added membership.

5. fair value measurements we consider the carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities to approximate their fair values because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization or payment. for our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value according to a three-tier fair value hierarchy as follows:
level 1 - observable inputs. level 1 financial instruments are actively traded and therefore the fair value for these securities is based on quoted market prices for identical securities in active markets.
level 2 - directly or indirectly observable inputs. fair value for these investments is determined using a market approach based on quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in inactive markets.
level 3 - unobservable inputs. level 3 financial instruments are valued using unobservable inputs that represent management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date. as of december 31, 2020, our level 3 financial instruments consisted of contingent consideration liabilities. as of december 31, 2019, our level 3 financial instruments consisted of derivative financial instruments.
the net changes in fair value of level 3 financial instruments are reported in "other" operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income. in the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized a loss of $ 6million, primarily for the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability described below, because the opening 2021 enrollment for our kentucky health plan was higher than our estimate as of september 30, 2020. in the year ended december 31, 2019, the net changes in fair value of level 3 financial instruments were insignificant to our results of operations.

contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31, 2020, our level 3 financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included contingent consideration liabilities of $ 46million, in connection with the kentucky acquisition described in note
4, "business combinations." as of december 31, 2020, the contingent consideration fair value was estimated primarily based on an amount we expect to pay the seller for members enrolled in our kentucky health plan as of january 1, 2021, over a minimum threshold. half this amount is payable later in 2021, with the remainder payable in early 2022, subject to review and agreement among us and the seller. the second half payment is contingent upon the outcome of certain legal challenges. the current portion is reported in "accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other," and the non-current portion is reported in "other long-term liabilities," in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured to fair value each quarter until the contingencies are resolved with fair value adjustments, if any, recorded to operations.

gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities are calculated under the specific identification method and are included in investment income. gross realized investment gains amounted to $ 6million and $ 13million in the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. gross realized investment losses were insignificant in the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019. gross realized investment gains and losses for the year ended december 31, 2018 were insignificant.
we have determined that unrealized losses at december 31, 2020 and 2019 primarily resulted from fluctuating interest rates, rather than a deterioration of the creditworthiness of the issuers. therefore, we determined that an allowance for credit losses was not necessary. so long as we maintain the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity, we are unlikely to experience losses. in the event that we dispose of these securities before maturity, we expect that realized losses, if any, will be insignificant.

the following table summarizes those available-for-sale investments that have been in a continuous loss position for less than 12 months. no investments have been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or more as of december 31, 2020, and 2019.

held-to-maturity pursuant to the regulations governing our health plans segment subsidiaries, we maintain statutory deposits and deposits required by government authorities primarily in cash, cash equivalents, and u.s. treasury securities. we also maintain restricted investments as protection against the insolvency of certain capitated providers. the use of these funds is limited as required by regulation in the various states in which we operate, or as needed in the event of insolvency of capitated providers. therefore, such investments are reported as "restricted investments" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
we have the ability to hold these restricted investments until maturity, and as a result, we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly due to a sudden change in market interest rates. our held-to-
maturity restricted investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, of which $ 134million will mature in one year or less, and $ 2million will mature in after one through five years. the following table presents the balances of restricted investments:

our estimates of medical claims and benefits payable recorded at december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 developed favorably by approximately $ 119million, $ 271million and $ 341million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
the favorable prior year development recognized in 2020 was primarily due to lower than expected utilization of medical services by our medicaid members, and improved operating performance. consequently, the ultimate costs recognized in 2020 were lower than our original estimates in 2019, which was not discernible until additional information was provided, and as claims payments were processed.

credit agreement in june 2020, we entered into a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") that replaced our prior credit agreement.

• an increase of the revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") from $ 500million to $ 1.0billion;
• a $ 15million swingline sub-facility and a $ 100million letter of credit sub-facility;
• an increase of incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions from $ 150million to $
500million, plus an unlimited amount as long as our consolidated net leverage ratio is not greater than 3:1;
• the ability to engage in acquisitions where the consummation of such acquisitions is not conditioned on the availability of, or on obtaining, third-party financing;
• termination of the term loan facility under the prior credit agreement; and
• libor succession provisions.
the credit agreement has a term of five years, and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on june 8, 2025.
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based, at our election, on a base rate or other defined rate, plus in each case, the applicable margin. in addition to interest payable on the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding from time to time under the credit agreement, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee.

4.875% notes due 2025. in december 2020, we completed the early redemption of the entire $ 330million aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the " 4.875% notes") that would have been due june 15, 2025. in accordance with the indenture governing such notes, the 4.875% notes were settled at 100% of par, plus an early redemption premium which amounted to $ 8million, plus accrued and unpaid interest. in conjunction with the redemption, we wrote off $
3million in unamortized deferred issuance costs directly related to the 4.875% notes.
1.125% cash convertible senior notes due 2020
in january 2020, we paid $ 39million to settle the $ 12million remaining principal amount outstanding of the 1.125%
cash convertible senior notes due january 15, 2020 (the " 1.125% convertible notes"), and settled the related conversion option.
other expenses (income), net in the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized an aggregate loss on debt repayment of $ 15million including costs incurred in repayment of the term loan facility, the 4.875% notes repayment costs described above, and other financing transactions. in the year ended december 31, 2019, we recognized a gain on debt repayment of $ 15million in connection with the 1.125% convertible notes repayment transactions. these amounts are reported in "other expenses (income), net" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

the effective tax rate was not impacted by the hif in 2019 given the hif moratorium. our effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. management estimates and judgments are required in determining our effective tax rate. we are routinely under audit by federal, state, or local authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions, nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions, and compliance with federal, state, foreign, and local tax laws.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:

at december 31, 2020, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 189million, which begin expiring in 2035.
at december 31, 2020, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 5million, which expire in 2031.
at december 31, 2020, we had california research and development and enterprise zone tax credit carryovers of $
3million, which will begin to expire in 2024, and foreign tax credit carryovers of $ 5million, which expire in
2030.
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance taking into consideration the ability to carry back and carry forward tax credits and losses, available tax planning strategies and future income, including reversal of temporary differences. we have determined that as of december 31, 2020, $ 17million of deferred tax assets did not satisfy the recognition criteria. therefore, we decreased our valuation allowance by $ 7million, from $ 24million at december 31, 2019, to $ 17million as of december 31, 2020.

we recognize tax benefits only if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained. we are subject to income taxes in the united states, puerto rico, and numerous state jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
the roll forward of our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

of period the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rates is $ 18million in each of those respective years. we expect that during the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefit liabilities may decrease by as much as $ 10million due to resolution of exams and refund claims.
our continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. amounts accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were insignificant.
we are under examination by the irs for calendar years 2015 through 2017 and may be subject to examination for calendar years 2018 and 2019. with a few exceptions, which are immaterial in the aggregate, we no longer are subject to state, local, and puerto rico tax examinations for years before 2015.
13. stockholders' equity stock purchase programs in september 2020, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $ 500million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this program is funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31, 2021. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. under this program, pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan, we purchased approximately 766,000shares of our common stock for $ 159million in november and december 2020 (average cost of $ 208.37per share), including approximately
29,000shares purchased for $ 6million in late december 2020, and settled in early january 2021.
in december 2019, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $ 500million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this program was funded with existing cash on hand and was completed in march 2020. under this program, pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan, we purchased approximately 3.4million shares of our common stock for $ 446million in the first quarter of 2020 (average cost of $ 132.45per share). in the first quarter of 2020, we also paid $ 7million to settle shares purchased in late december 2019.
subsequent event from january 1, 2021 through february 11, 2021, we purchased approximately 577,000shares for $ 122million (average cost of $ 211.65per share).
warrants in connection with the 1.125% convertible notes settlement transaction described in note 11, "debt," in the first quarter of 2020 we entered into privately negotiated agreements to terminate the associated 310,000warrants outstanding for $ 30million, which resulted in a reduction of additional paid-in-capital for the same amount.

share-based compensation in connection with our employee stock plans, approximately 244,000shares and 242,000shares of common stock were issued, net of shares used to settle employees' income tax obligations, during the years ended december 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. total share-based compensation expense is reported in "general and administrative expenses"

"psas"), performance units ("psus"), stock options, and other stock- or cash-based awards, to eligible persons who perform services for us. the 2019 eip provides for the issuance of up to 2.9million shares of our common stock.
stock-based awards . rsas, psas and psus are granted with a fair value equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, and generally vest in equal annual installments over periods up to four yearsfrom the date of grant. certain psus may vest in their entirety at the end of three-yearperformance periods, if their performance conditions are met. we generally recognize expense for rsas, psas and psus on a straight-line basis.

as of december 31, 2020, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested rsas and psus was $ 42million, and $ 23million, respectively, which we expect to recognize over a remaining weighted-average period of 2.2years, and 1.2years, respectively. this unrecognized compensation cost assumes an estimated forfeiture rate of 12.2% for non-executive employees as of december 31, 2020, based on actual forfeitures over the last 4years.

employee stock purchase plans ("espp")
under our espp, eligible employees may purchase common shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on either the first or last trading day of each six-month offering period. each participant is limited to a maximum purchase of $ 25,000(as measured by the fair value of the stock acquired) per year through payroll deductions. we estimate the fair value of the stock issued using a standard option pricing model. for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the inputs to this model were as follows: risk-free interest rates of approximately 0.2% to 2.3%; expected volatility of approximately 31% to 51%, dividend yields of 0%, and an average expected life of 0.5years.

14. employee benefit plans we sponsor defined contribution 401(k) plans that cover substantially all employees of our company and its subsidiaries. eligible employees are permitted to contribute up to the maximum amount allowed by law. we match up to the first 4% of compensation contributed by employees. expense recognized in connection with our contributions to the 401(k) plans amounted to $ 28million, $ 28million, and $ 36million in the years ended december 31, 2020,
2019, and 2018, respectively.
we also have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain key employees. under this plan, eligible participants may defer up to 75% of their base salary and 90% of their bonus to provide tax-deferred growth.
15. commitments and contingencies regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions our health plans, which are generally operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states, are subject to state laws and regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state. the national association of insurance commissioners ("naic"), has adopted rules which, if implemented by the states, set minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies, hmos, and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. the requirements take the form of risk-based capital
("rbc") rules which may vary from state to state. regulators in some states may also enforce capital requirements that require the retention of net worth in excess of amounts formally required by statute or regulation.
all of the states in which our health plans operate, except california, florida, massachusetts and new york, have adopted the rbc rules. the rbc rules, if adopted by california, florida, massachusetts or new york, could increase the minimum capital required for those states. our massachusetts health plan, acquired on december 31, 2020, maintains a $ 35million performance bond, effective through december 31, 2021, to partially satisfy minimum net worth requirements in that state.
statutes, regulations and informal capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment, and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based on current statutes and regulations, the net assets in these subsidiaries (not including the magellan complete care subsidiaries and after intercompany eliminations), which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends was approximately $ 1,960million at december 31, 2020, and $ 1,810million at december
31, 2019. we estimate the magellan complete care subsidiaries' net assets that may not be transferable amounted to approximately $ 420million at december 31, 2020. because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plans to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by the parent company-molina healthcare, inc. such cash, cash equivalents and investments amounted to $ 644million and $
997million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
as of december 31, 2020, our health plans (not including the magellan complete care subsidiaries) had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $ 2,020million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $ 1,310million. as of december 31, 2020, the aggregate and minimum capital and surplus of the magellan complete care subsidiaries amounted to approximately $ 420million and $
230million, respectively. the aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of december 31, 2020. we have the ability and commitment to provide additional capital to each of our health plans when necessary to ensure that statutory capital and surplus continue to meet regulatory requirements.
covid-19 pandemic we continue to monitor and assess the estimated operating and financial impact of the covid-19 pandemic, and as it evolves, we continue to process, assemble, and assess member utilization information. we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under the credit agreement, and cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to withstand the financial impact of the pandemic, and will enable us to continue to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.

legal proceedings the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments.
compliance with these laws and regulations can be subject to government review and interpretation, as well as regulatory actions unknown and unasserted at this time. penalties associated with violations of these laws and regulations include significant fines and penalties, exclusion from participating in publicly funded programs, and the repayment of previously billed and collected revenues.
we are involved in legal actions in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, various employment claims, vendor disputes and provider claims. some of these legal actions seek monetary damages, including claims for punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance. we review legal matters and update our estimates of reasonably possible losses and related disclosures, as necessary. we have accrued liabilities for legal matters for which we deem the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. these liability estimates could change as a result of further developments of the matters. the outcome of legal actions is inherently uncertain. an adverse determination in one or more of these pending matters could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
kentucky rfp. on september 4, 2020, anthem kentucky managed care plan, inc. brought an action in franklin county circuit court against the kentucky finance and administration cabinet, the kentucky cabinet for health and family services and all of the winning bidder health plans, including molina healthcare of kentucky, inc., civil action no. 20-ci-00719. in its action, anthem requested that the court disqualify molina healthcare of kentucky, find that the kentucky rfp scoring was erroneous and violated procedures or was arbitrary and capricious, set aside the contract awards and conduct a new rfp evaluation process, and award injunctive relief, including stopping the implementation of the contracts awarded under the rfp. on september 28, 2020, the court issued a temporary restraining order preserving the status quo, and on october 23, 2020, the court issued a temporary injunction directing that the rfp readiness review and open enrollment proceed with six health plans, including both anthem and molina healthcare.
on december 22, 2020, the court granted a motion by unitedhealthcare of kentucky ltd. to assert a cross-claim against the kentucky cabinet for health and family services, which sought in part a disqualification of anthem or molina healthcare and a declaratory judgment that the kentucky medicaid program proceed with only five health plans. on december 23, 2020, humana health plan, inc. brought a separate action against the commonwealth of kentucky and the winning bidder health plans, including molina healthcare of kentucky, civil action 20-ci-00987. on january 11, 2021, both actions were consolidated before the franklin county circuit court. humana requests a declaratory judgment finding that the commonwealth violated the medicaid contract by allocating passport members to molina healthcare for 2021 so that passport members would instead be allocated to humana and other winning health plans, or, in the alternative, monetary damages from the commonwealth.
molina healthcare believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims of anthem, united, and humana, and intends to vigorously defend its position, including its twice being a winning bidder of the kentucky medicaid rfp, and its protection of the continuity of care for passport medicaid members. this matter remains subject to significant additional legal proceedings, and no assurances can be given regarding the ultimate outcome. under the court's temporary injunction, molina healthcare of kentucky continues to operate under its contract and provide care to kentucky medicaid members.
professional liability insurance we carry medical professional liability insurance for healthcare services rendered in the primary care institutions that we manage. in addition, we carry managed care errors and omissions insurance for all managed care services that we provide.
16. segments as of december 31, 2020, we had tworeportable segments: the health plans segment, and the other segment. our reportable segments are consistent with how we currently manage the business and view the markets we serve. the health plans reportable segment includes our regulated health plan operating segments, along with the recently acquired magellan complete care health plans operating segment. because this acquisition closed on december 31,
2020, magellan complete care's operating results were insignificant to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020. management will continue to evaluate the composition of its operating and reportable segments for future filings. the other segment, which is insignificant to our consolidated results of operations, includes certain corporate amounts not associated with or allocated to the health plans segment. in
2018, the other segment also included the results of certain unregulated subsidiaries we sold in late 2018.

margin is the appropriate earnings measure for our reportable segments, based on how our chief operating decision maker currently reviews results, assesses performance, and allocates resources.
the key metrics used to assess the performance of our health plans segment are premium revenue, medical margin and mcr. mcr represents the amount of medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue. therefore, the underlying margin, or the amount earned by the health plans segment after medical costs are deducted from premium revenue, is the most important measure of earnings reviewed by management. margin for our health plans segment is also referred to as "medical margin."

controls and procedures management's evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in rule 13a-15(e) and rule 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-
benefit relationship of any possible controls and procedures.
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this form 10-k pursuant to rule 13a-15(b) and rule 15d-15(b) of the exchange act. based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31, 2020, at the reasonable assurance level. in addition, management concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") for each of the periods presented herein.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the exchange act. our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with gaap. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31,
2020, based on criteria described in internal control-integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso").
on september 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of certain assets of passport health plan, inc. ("passport"). on december 31, 2020, we completed our acquisition of the magellan complete care line of business of magellan health, inc. we are in the process of evaluating the existing controls and procedures of passport and magellan complete care, and integrating passport and magellan complete care into our internal control over financial reporting. in accordance with sec staff guidance permitting a company to exclude an acquired business from management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year in which the acquisition is completed, we have excluded the business that we acquired in the passport and magellan complete care acquisitions from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december

management's assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31, 2020, includes all of our consolidated operations except for those disclosure controls and procedures of passport and magellan complete care that are subsumed by internal control over financial reporting.
ernst & young, llp, the independent registered public accounting firm who audited our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k, has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) of the exchange act) during the quarter ended december 31, 2020, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of molina healthcare, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of molina healthcare, inc. (the "company") as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2020, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at december 31, 2020 and
2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december
31, 2020, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob"), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2020, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework), and our report dated february 16, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
valuation of incurred but not paid fee-for-service claims as of december 31, 2020, the company's liability for fee-for-service claims incurred but not paid ("ibnp"), excluding ibnp acquired from the magellan complete care ("mcc") acquisition, comprised $1,647 million of the $2,696 million of medical claims and benefits payable. as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's ibnp liability is determined using actuarial methods that include a number of factors and assumptions, including completion description of the matter    factors, which seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date, based on historical payment patterns, and assumed health care cost trend factors, which represent an estimate of claims expense based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare cost levels. there is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management's best estimate of completion and trend factors, which are used to calculate actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claims.

auditing management's best estimate of the ibnp liability was complex and required the involvement of our actuarial specialists due to the highly judgmental nature of completion and trend factor assumptions used in the valuation process. these assumptions have a significant effect on the valuation of the ibnp liability.
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's controls over the process for estimating the ibnp liability. this included testing management how we addressed the matter in our audit    review controls over completion and trend factor assumptions, and management's review and approval of actuarial methods used to calculate ibnp liability, including the data inputs and outputs of those models.
to test ibnp liability, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation by testing reconciliations of underlying claims and membership data recorded in source systems to the actuarial reserving calculations, and comparing a sample of claims to source documentation. with the assistance of ey actuarial specialists, we evaluated the company's selection and weighting of actuarial methods by comparing the weightings used in the current estimate to those used in prior periods and those used in the industry for the specific types of insurance. to evaluate significant assumptions used by management in the actuarial methods, we compared assumptions to current and historical claims trends, to those used historically and to current industry benchmarks. we also compared management's recorded ibnp liability to a range of reasonable ibnp estimates calculated independently by our ey actuarial specialists.
additionally, we performed a review of the prior period estimates using subsequent claims development, and we reviewed and evaluated management's disclosures surrounding fee-for-service claims ibnp.
valuation of intangibles during 2020, the company completed its acquisition of mcc for net description of the matter                   consideration of $1,037 million, as disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method.
auditing the company's accounting for its acquisition of mcc was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the company's determination of the fair value of acquired contract rights which comprised $171 million of the acquired identified intangible assets of $191 million. the company used a discounted cash flow model to measure contract rights. the significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the fair value to underlying assumptions, specifically changes in forecasted operating margins, and the weighted average cost of capital, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's controls over its how we addressed the matter in our audit    accounting for acquisitions. this included testing management review controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and measurement of contract rights. we also tested management's review of assumptions used in the valuation models.
to test the estimated fair value of contract rights, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the company's selection of the valuation methodology and significant assumptions used by the company's valuation specialist, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. we involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates. we compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes to the company's business, markets, membership retention and growth rates, and other factors.  additionally, we reviewed and evaluated management's disclosures surrounding determination of the intangible assets.

management's discussion and analysis of the changes in medical margin is discussed below under "financial performance."
see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 16, "segments," for more information.

health plans as of december 31, 2020, the health plans segment consisted of health plans operating in 15 states, and served approximately 4.0 million members eligible for medicaid, medicare, and other government-sponsored healthcare programs for low-income families and individuals, including marketplace members, most of whom receive government premium subsidies. in addition, in connection with our acquisition of magellan complete care on december 31, 2020, we added approximately 200,000 members, and now operate health plans in 18 states.
the health plans reportable segment includes our regulated health plan operating segments, along with the recently acquired magellan complete care health plans operating segment. because this acquisition closed on december 31,
2020, magellan complete care's operating results were insignificant to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020.
trends and uncertainties for a discussion of the health plans segment's trends, uncertainties and other developments, refer to "item 1.
business-our business," "-covid-19 pandemic," and "-legislative and political environment."

as discussed above, the combination of all the covid-19 pandemic-related impacts decreased pretax income in 2020
and increased our consolidated mcr in 2020 by approximately 50 basis points. some of these items increased earnings, such as lower than expected medical costs from the curtailment of utilization that benefited all our state health plans, and a meaningful increase in medicaid membership, while others served to decrease earnings, such as the temporary, retroactive medicaid premium refunds and related actions enacted by certain states.
comments relating to the performance of our health plans in california, ohio, texas and washington, which represent our largest health plans from a premium revenue standpoint, follow:
california. for the year ended december 31, 2020, medical margin declined when compared with 2019, as the lower medical care costs from the curtailment of utilization were more than offset by retroactive medicaid premium refunds and underperformance in the marketplace program.

net effects of covid-19 had an unfavorable impact on medical margins in all programs in 2020, as the retroactive premium refunds exceeded the benefit from lower medical costs due to the curtailment of utilization.
texas. for the year ended december 31, 2020, premium revenues and medical margin were both slightly higher when compared with 2019. medical margin increased due to higher premium revenues and a lower mcr in medicaid, mostly driven by curtailment of utilization related to covid-19 premiums, partially offset by underperformance in marketplace. the decline in marketplace resulted mainly from lower premiums and higher acuity mix for the new members we served.
washington. for the year ended december 31, 2020, medical margin was higher when compared with 2019, mainly due to improved results in medicaid. medicaid premium revenues increased in the year ended december 31, 2020, due to membership growth. in addition, results in the year ended december 31, 2020, benefited modestly from lower medical costs due to the curtailment of utilization driven by covid-19, which was partially offset by covid-related provider payments mandated by the state in the second quarter of 2020.

medicaid medicaid premium revenue increased $1,799 million in 2020, when compared with 2019, mainly due to membership growth and premium increases in several states, and the impact from suspension of redeterminations due to covid-19.
excluding acquisitions and our planned exit from puerto rico, we have added approximately 415,000 new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations. these premium increases were partially offset by premium refunds and related actions enacted in several states in response to the lower utilization of medical services stemming from covid-19.
the medical margin of our medicaid program increased $307 million, or 21%, in 2020 when compared with 2019. the increase was driven by increased premium revenues and margin associated with the membership growth discussed above, and from a reduction in the mcr.
the medicaid mcr decreased to 87.4% in 2020, from 88.0% in 2019, or 60 basis points. the decrease in the medicaid mcr in 2020 was due to improvements across all programs. the mcr benefited from operational improvements and premium increases in several states, but was partially offset by unfavorable effects of covid-19, including the impact of the premium refunds and related actions, net of lower medical costs due to the curtailment of utilization.
in the third quarter of 2020, we recognized a $10 million premium deficiency reserve ("pdr") associated with the puerto rico medicaid business. we exited this business on october 31, 2020. the pdr represents the estimated remaining claims and administrative costs that exceed the estimated remaining premiums associated with the contract.
these improvements were partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year changes in prior year reserve development.
prior year reserve development in 2020 was not material; however, 2019 was positively impacted by 100 basis points of favorable reserve development.
medicare medicare premium revenue increased $269 million in 2020, when compared with 2019, primarily due to increases in premium revenue pmpm and member months. pmpms improved due to increased revenue resulting from risk scores that are more commensurate with the acuity of our population and increases in quality incentive premium revenues. these increases were partially offset by premium refunds, mainly in mmp, enacted in response to the lower utilization of medical services stemming from covid-19.

the medical margin for medicare increased $21 million, or 6%, in 2020 when compared with 2019, primarily due to the increase in premium revenue discussed above, partially offset by increases in medical costs pmpm.
the medicare mcr increased from 85.3% in 2019 to 86.0% in 2020, or 70 basis points. the increase was primarily driven by an increase in medical care costs pmpm, which was mainly attributed to unfavorable changes in member mix, including higher acuity populations. the medical cost pmpm also reflected modestly lower utilization of medical services stemming from covid-19. the impact of increased medical costs on the mcr was partially offset by the increase in the premium revenue pmpm discussed above.
marketplace marketplace premium revenue increased $23 million in 2020, when compared with 2019, mainly due to increased membership, partially offset by a decrease in premium revenue pmpm. the decrease in premium revenue pmpm was mainly driven by lower pricing, in an effort to be more competitive and generate membership growth, and the impact of more health plans being subject to minimum medical loss ratio rebates when compared with the prior year. the factors decreasing premium revenue pmpm were partially offset by the impact of higher risk adjustment premiums, resulting from higher acuity of our membership.
the marketplace medical margin decreased $152 million in 2020, despite the increase in premium revenues, due to an increase in the mcr compared to 2019.
the marketplace mcr increased to 78.7% in 2020, compared to 68.2% in 2019. the increase in mcr was driven by the impact of the decrease in premium revenue pmpm discussed above, combined with an increase in medical cost pmpm when compared with 2019. the higher medical cost pmpm was primarily due to a higher member acuity mix and increased medical costs related to covid-19. the rebound in utilization for marketplace, following the curtailment from covid-19, has been much more pronounced than our medicaid and medicare programs. additionally, our risk scores, though increased compared to 2019, continue to lag the acuity of our membership.
other the other segment includes certain corporate amounts not allocated to the health plans segment. in 2020 and 2019, such amounts were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations.
liquidity and financial condition liquidity we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.
we maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company. our regulated health plan subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue and net income. such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity. thus, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. we generally receive premium revenue a short time before we pay for the related healthcare services. the majority of the assets held by our regulated health plan subsidiaries is in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. the regulated health plan subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent company amounting to $635
million in 2020, and $1,373 million in 2019, respectively. the parent company contributed capital of $107 million and $43 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements.
cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to $644 million and $997 million as of december 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. the decrease in 2020 was mainly due to cash used for magellan complete care and other acquisitions, and common stock repurchases. these outflows were partially offset by inflows from net debt financing transactions, and dividends received from regulated health plan subsidiaries, net of contributions, as described above. see further discussion below, in "investing activities," and "financing activities."

investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board-approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than
10 years, or less than 10 years average life for structured securities. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels.
we believe that the risks of the covid-19 pandemic, as they relate to our investments, are minimal. the overall rating of our portfolio remains strong and is rated aa. our investment policy has directives in conjunction with state guidelines to minimize risks and exposures in volatile markets. additionally, our portfolio managers assist us in navigating the current volatility in the capital markets.
our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, and u.s. treasury securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. all of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets.
cash flow activities our cash flows are summarized as follows:

cash equivalents operating activities we typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government payors may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. for example, government payors may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month's premium payment.
net cash provided by operations was $1,890 million in 2020, compared with $427 million of net cash provided in
2019. the $1,463 million increase in year-over-year cash flow was due to cash flow timing benefits from the growth in membership in 2020, and the net impact of timing differences in governmental receivables and payables.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $400 million in 2020, compared with $293 million of net cash used in
2019, a decrease in year-over-year cash flow of $107 million. the decrease was mainly attributable to net cash paid in the yourcare, passport and magellan complete care acquisitions, partially offset by decreased purchases of investments in 2020.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $225 million in 2020, compared with $552 million of net cash used in
2019, an increase in year-over-year cash flow of $777 million. in 2020, cash inflows included $1,429 million from the issuance of the 4.375% and 3.875% notes and $380 million borrowed under the term loan facility. cash outflows included the $600 million repayment of the term loan facility, common stock purchases of $606 million, which included $7 million to settle shares purchased in late december 2019, and net cash paid for the aggregate convertible senior notes ‐ related transactions amounting to $42 million. in 2019, cash outflows included net cash paid for the aggregate convertible senior notes-related transactions of $754 million, and $47 million paid for common stock purchases, partially offset by proceeds of $220 million borrowed under the term loan facility.

financial condition we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our credit agreement as discussed further below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future sources," and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, as of december 31, 2020, our working capital was $2,911 million compared with $2,698
million as of december 31, 2019. at december 31, 2020, our cash and investments amounted to $6,165 million, compared with $4,477 million of cash and investments at december 31, 2019.
because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plans to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. for more information, see the "liquidity"
discussion presented above.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions each of our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulations. such statutes, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions, loans or advances that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement for these subsidiaries (not including the magellan complete care subsidiaries) was estimated to be approximately $1,310
million at december 31, 2020, compared with $1,110 million at december 31, 2019. we estimate the magellan complete care subsidiaries' minimum capital and surplus requirement amounted to approximately $230 million at december 31,
2020. the aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of both dates.
under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of december 31, 2020, was approximately $60 million in the aggregate. the subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities.
based on our cash and investments balances as of december 31, 2020, management believes that its regulated wholly owned subsidiaries remain well capitalized and exceed their regulatory minimum requirements. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with statutory capital and surplus requirements.
debt ratings each of our high-yield senior notes is rated "bb-" by standard & poor's, and "ba3" by moody's investor service, inc. a downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs.
financial covenants the credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. such ratios are computed as defined by the terms of the credit agreement.
in addition, the indentures governing each of our outstanding high-yield senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. as of december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement and other long-term debt.
future sources and uses of liquidity future sources our health plans segment regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which is generally received a short time before related healthcare services are paid. premium revenue is our primary source of liquidity. thus, any decline in the receipt of premium revenue, and our profitability, could have a negative impact on our liquidity.

potential impact of covid-19 pandemic . excluding acquisitions and our planned exit from puerto rico, we have added approximately 415,000 new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations.
it remains unclear how high the covid-related membership peak will be, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers, and where it will ultimately settle. however it does now appear that since unemployment nationally has fallen to 6.3% as of january 2021, the initial industry estimates of unemployment-related medicaid membership increases were somewhat overstated. on a related note, the declaration of the extension of the public health emergency period to april 2021, with a potential extension from the biden administration for the public health emergency to remain in place for all of 2021, will also likely have an impact. therefore, we are currently unable to predict the timing or amount of the expected increases in enrollment. increased membership would increase our premium revenue, but would also likely result in a significant increase in medical care claims and related costs.
we believe that we have the scalability necessary to both serve new members, and ably partner with our state customers for increases in membership.
dividends from subsidiaries. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, state regulators could restrict the ability of our regulated health plan subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company, which could reduce the liquidity of the parent company. for more information on our regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions, refer to notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions," and note 17, "condensed financial information of registrant-note c - dividends and capital contributions."
credit agreement borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2020, we had available borrowing capacity of $1 billion under the revolving credit facility of our credit agreement. in addition, the credit agreement provides for a $15
million swingline sub-facility and a $100 million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions up to $500 million, plus an unlimited amount of such term loans as long as we maintain a minimum consolidated net leverage ratio. see further discussion in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."
future uses common stock purchases. in september 2020, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this program is funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31, 2021.
the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. following the purchases completed under a rule 10b5-1 trading plan from november 2020 through february 11, 2021, there is approximately $219 million remaining available to purchase our common stock through december 31, 2021. see further information in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 13,
"stockholders' equity."
acquisitions . we have a disciplined and steady approach to growth. organic growth, which includes leveraging our existing health plan portfolio and winning new territories, is our highest priority. in addition to organic growth, we will consider targeted acquisitions that are a strategic fit that we believe will leverage operational synergies, and lead to incremental earnings accretion. for further information on our acquisitions, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations."
in september 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all the assets of affinity health plan, inc. the net purchase price for the transaction is approximately $380 million, subject to various adjustments at closing, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. we currently expect the transaction to close as early as the second quarter of 2021.
in september 2020, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of passport health plan, inc. the purchase consideration included estimated contingent consideration of approximately $46 million as of december 31, 2020.
half this amount is payable later in 2021, with the remainder payable in early 2022, subject to review and agreement among us and the seller. the second half payment is contingent upon the outcome of certain legal challenges.

outcome of aca litigation. as described above in "health plans segment-trends and uncertainties," the u.s. supreme court has accepted the appeal of the fifth circuit court's decision regarding the constitutionality and severability of the individual mandate. the aca remains in effect pending the issuance of the supreme court's opinion. a decision by the supreme court that the entirety of the aca is unconstitutional could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.
potential impact of covid-19 pandemic . beginning in early 2020 the pandemic, along with the related quarantine and social distancing measures, reduced demand for certain routine and non-critical medical services, while at the same time increased demand for other medical services, such as covid-19 testing and emergency services. in 2020, utilization was curtailed, but could rebound to more normal levels in 2021. increased demand for medical services, which we are presently unable to predict the timing or magnitude, could result in a significant increase in medical care costs and related provider claims payments.
also, as described above in "item 1. business-covid-19 pandemic," we have been subject to premium refunds and related actions as a result of the pandemic. in 2020, various states enacted temporary premium refunds and related actions in response to the reduced demand for medical services stemming from covid-19, which resulted in a reduction of our medical margin. in some cases, these premium actions were retroactive to earlier periods in 2020, or as early as the beginning of the states' fiscal years in 2019. beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we have recognized retroactive premium actions that we believe to be probable, and where the ultimate premium amount is reasonably estimable. we recognized $564 million related to these retroactive premium actions, in the aggregate, in
2020.
it is possible that certain states could increase the level of existing premium refunds, and it is also possible that other states could implement some form of retroactive premium refund in the future. due to these uncertainties, the ultimate outcomes could differ materially from our estimates as a result of changes in facts or further developments, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements.
the molina healthcare charitable foundation. in august 2020, we announced our commitment of $150 million to fund the molina healthcare charitable foundation (the "foundation"), an independent not-for-profit charitable foundation. we contributed $15 million to the foundation in the fourth quarter of 2020.
critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates, and some differences could be material.
our most significant accounting estimates, which include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity, include the following:
• medical claims and benefits payable. see discussion below, and refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, notes 2, "significant accounting policies," and 10, "medical claims and benefits payable" for more information.
• contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit. for a discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
• quality incentives. for a discussion of this topic, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note
2, "significant accounting policies."
• business combinations, and goodwill and intangible assets, net. at december 31, 2020, goodwill and intangible assets, net, represented approximately 10% of total assets and 45% of total stockholders' equity, compared with 3%
and 9%, respectively, at december 31, 2019. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2,
"significant accounting policies," note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net."

medical care costs, medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-
service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability.
medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk. ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. we also include an additional reserve to ensure that our overall ibnp liability is sufficient under moderately adverse conditions. we reflect changes in these estimates in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.
the estimation of the ibnp liability requires a significant degree of judgment in applying actuarial methods, determining the appropriate assumptions and considering numerous factors. of those factors, we consider estimated completion factors (measures the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical payment patterns) and the assumed healthcare cost trend (the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. other relevant factors also include, but are not limited to, healthcare service utilization trends, claim inventory levels, changes in membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in medicaid fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date, we mainly use estimated completion factors to estimate the ultimate cost of those claims. completion factors measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical claims payment patterns. we analyze historical claims payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates to claim payment dates to estimate completion factors. the estimated completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claims cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. the difference between the estimated ultimate claims cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents our estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in our ibnp liability .
for claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date, actual claims paid are a less reliable measure of our ultimate cost since a large portion of medical claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been submitted. accordingly, we estimate our ibnp liability for claims incurred during these months based on a blend of estimated completion factors and assumed medical care cost trend. the assumed medical care cost trend represents the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs, which can be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, changes in member demographics, catastrophes and epidemics , and other relevant factors.

magnitude or severity of claims, uncertainties related to our entry into new geographical markets or provision of services to new populations, changes in state-controlled fee schedules, and modifications or upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices. therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.
when subsequent actual claims payments are less than we estimated, we recognize a benefit for favorable prior period development that is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: "prior years" in the table presented in note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable." our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. this provision is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: current year" in the table presented in note 10. assuming stability in the size of our membership, the use of this consistent methodology, during any given period, usually results in the replenishment of reserves at a level that generally offsets the benefit of favorable prior period development in that period. in the case of material growth or decline of membership, replenishment can exceed or fall short of the favorable development, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2020 that would result if we change our completion factors for the fourth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2020, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. the following tables do not include amounts relating to our recent acquisitions of magellan complete care and passport. dollar amounts are in millions.

there are many related factors working in conjunction with one another that determine the accuracy of our estimates, some of which are qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. therefore, we are seldom able to quantify the impact that any single factor has on a change in estimate. given the variability inherent in the reserving process, we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations. as a result, we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimates.
recently issued accounting standards refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that affect us.

contractual obligations in the table below, we present our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2020. some of the amounts included in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.
additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material non-cancelable commitments. we are not a party to off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

inflation we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation. specifically, our health plans try to control medical care costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services.
through these contracted providers, our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services. there can be no assurance, however, that our strategies to mitigate medical care cost inflation will be successful. competitive pressures, new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from healthcare providers and customers, applicable regulations, or other factors may affect our ability to control medical care costs.
compliance costs our health plans are regulated by both state and federal government agencies. regulation of managed care products and healthcare services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. changes in applicable laws and rules occur frequently. compliance with such laws and rules may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of additional systems, procedures and programs that we have not yet identified.

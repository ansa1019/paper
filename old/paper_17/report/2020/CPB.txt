item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition.
operational risk factors the outbreak of covid-19 and associated responses could adversely impact our business and results of operations the covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets throughout the world. in response, governmental authorities have implemented numerous measures in an attempt to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. although our business has benefitted from some of these measures, the impact and associated responses of the covid-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to:
•a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution facilities, or disruption in our supply chain, including but not limited to, as a result of illness, government restrictions or other workforce disruptions;
•the failure of third parties on which we rely, including but not limited to, those that supply our packaging, ingredients, equipment and other necessary operating materials, co-manufacturers and independent contractors, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so;
•a strain on our supply chain, which could result from continued increased retailer and consumer demand for our products;
•a disruption to our distribution capabilities or to our distribution channels, including those of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors;
•reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as we prioritize the production of other products due to increased demand;
•new or escalated government or regulatory responses in markets where we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, or in the markets of third parties on which we rely, could prevent or disrupt our business operations;
•continued commodity cost volatility, which may not be sufficiently offset by our commodity hedging activities;
•a significant portion of our workforce, including our management team, could become unable to work as a result of illness, or the attention of our management team could be diverted if key employees become ill from covid-19 and unable to work;
•higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation and independent contractor payments, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards, which could continue or could increase in these or other areas;
•the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship; or decrease in demand due to the easing of governmental authority restrictions and business closings; or decrease in pantry-loading activity;
•a change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of retailers, distributors, or carriers modifying their inventory, fulfillment or shipping practices;
•an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer shopping habits due to, among other things, reduced in-store visits and travel restrictions;
•a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products;
•an increased reliance on our information technology systems due to many employees working remotely causing us to be increasingly subject to cyberattack;
•a continued decrease in demand at restaurants or other away from home dining establishments resulting from government restrictions and social distancing measures, which adversely affects our foodservice business; and
•continued business disruptions and uncertainties related to the covid-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and productivity initiatives on the original timelines.

these and other impacts of the covid-19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included below in this item 1a. the ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the current covid-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
we face significant competition in all our product categories, which may result in lower sales and margins we operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the north american market and experience competition in all of our categories. the principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. a number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. in addition, reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition. a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a continued shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing prices, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share, each of which may result in lower sales and margins.
our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. there are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. if we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability. if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline. in addition, given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. as such, we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories. in addition, the covid-19 pandemic has altered, and in some cases, delayed product innovation efforts. finally, if we fail to rapidly develop products in faster-growing and more profitable categories, we could experience reduced demand for our products, or fail to expand margins.
we may not achieve our targeted cost savings, which may adversely affect our ability to grow margins we are pursuing multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of snyder's-lance. these initiatives require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives, including the integration of snyder's-lance in an efficient and effective manner. in some respects, our plans to achieve these cost savings continue to be refined. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation - restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives" for additional information on these initiatives. we have recently delayed the implementation of system upgrades and certain other cost-saving and productivity initiatives due to the covid-19 pandemic. continued disruptions and uncertainties related to the covid-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve our cost savings and productivity initiatives on the same timelines. these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale. our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often complex initiatives. any failure to or delay in implementing our initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our ability to grow margins.
we may not be able to increase prices to fully offset increases in prices of raw and packaging materials or distribution costs as a manufacturer of food and beverage products, the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, dairy, potatoes and other vegetables, steel, aluminum, glass, paper and resin. many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, government-sponsored agricultural programs and other government policy, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, pandemic illness (such as the covid-19 pandemic) and other factors that may be beyond our control. despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet increased demand for our products, certain ingredients and packaging, including steel, aluminum, glass, agricultural products, proteins and other commodities have been adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2021. the cost of distribution decreased in 2020 due to a decline in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess availability, warehousing efficiencies and lower fuel costs, however, we have experienced a recent increase in
7
transportation and logistics costs. we may not be able to offset any price increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity.
we try to pass along to customers some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchases altogether, during an economic downturn. to the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
we may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. we expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future. these alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. in addition, retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers. these customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products, which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products. if we are unable to use our scale, marketing, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted.
in 2020, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations, with the largest customer, wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 21% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations. in addition, the kroger co. and its affiliates accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2020. there can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities, or on the same terms as in the past. disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results.
our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands we have a number of iconic brands with significant value. maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions. success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be adversely impacted.
disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors. this damage or disruption could result from execution issues, as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as increased temperatures due to climate change, water stress, extreme weather events, natural disasters, product or raw material scarcity, fire, terrorism, pandemics (such as the covid-19 pandemic), strikes, cybersecurity breaches, government shutdowns, disruptions in logistics, supplier capacity constraints or other events. commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile during the covid-19 pandemic. production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease and crop pests. failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. disputes with significant suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.
we have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. we have implemented employee safety measures, which exceed guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention
8
and world health organization, across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, enhanced sanitation, social distancing, mask use, plexiglass dividers, and temperature screenings. even with these measures, there is risk that covid-19 may spread through our workforce. illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. we may face additional production disruptions in the future, which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs.
we experienced increased demand for our products in the second half of 2020. short-term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we are actively monitoring the continued spread of the covid-19 pandemic and its ongoing impact on our supply chain and operations, however we are unable to accurately predict the future impact that the covid-19 pandemic will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities.
if our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputation we have in the past and we may, in the future, need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers. a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. we could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. in addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category.
an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth as of august 2, 2020, we had goodwill of $3,986 million and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $2,611 million. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. if the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. we have experienced impairment charges in prior years. see "significant accounting estimates" and notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on such impairments. if current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, we may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth.
our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands we consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results.
competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results.
9
we may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the u.s. and certain non-u.s. locations. the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
we may be adversely impacted by a failure or security breach of our information technology systems our information technology systems are critically important to our operations. we rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage our data, communications and business processes, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, procurement, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. furthermore, our information technology systems are subject to attack or other security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer, employee or other confidential information), service disruptions or other system failures. if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches, disruptions or failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data protection laws and regulations.
to address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies, cyber insurance, employee training, and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems. we believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks. although we have not experienced a material incident to date, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident. the cost to remediate damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant.
in addition, in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect our business and financial results. we have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. if these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted.
we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. in addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. we also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. in addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. we also recently streamlined our business into a two-division operating model, which could lead to operational challenges and higher employee turnover.
our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions we have historically made strategic acquisition of brands and businesses and we may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future. our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms, obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions. potential risks also include:
•the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner, including implementation of enterprise-resource planning systems;
•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;
•potential loss of key employees, suppliers and/or customers of acquired businesses;
•assumption of unknown risks and liabilities;
10
•the inability to achieve anticipated benefits, including revenues or other operating results;
•operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected;
•the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment; and
•the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience.
in addition, during the first half of 2020, we completed the sale of our kelsen business and the arnott's and other international operations, and we may undertake other divestitures in the future. any other businesses we decide to divest in the future may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. potential risks of divestitures may also include:
•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;
•loss of key suppliers and/or customers of divested businesses;
•the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations; and
•the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs.
if we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of future acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.
market conditions and other general risk factors we face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the u.s. or other nations. similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets, the risk of which has been heightened due to the covid-19 pandemic, may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like, and our borrowing costs could increase. the covid-19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets. we may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts. in addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the u.s. or other nations, whether due to recession, economic disruptions or other reasons, may adversely impact us.
the administering regulatory authority regulating the london interbank offered rate (libor) announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of december 2021. our variable rate debt and revolving credit facility use libor as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. while we expect to have paid off our variable-rate debt and replaced or renegotiated our revolving credit facility by the end of december 2021, we may incur additional indebtedness and/or negotiate new credit terms that will rely on an alternative interest rate method to libor. any legal or regulatory changes made in response to libor's future discontinuance may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in libor, a delay in the publication of libor, or changes in the rules or methodologies in libor. in addition, alternative methods to libor may not yet have been established by the end of december 2021, and the impact of such alternative methods may be impossible or impracticable to determine. while we do not expect that the transition from libor and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, it is still uncertain at this time.
actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business we were the target of activist shareholder activities in 2019. if a new activist investor purchased our stock, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. in addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and other strategic partners, and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.
11
legal and regulatory risk factors we may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claims we are a party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding reportable legal proceedings. since these actions are inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. in particular, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. additionally, the independent contractor distribution model, which is used by pepperidge farm and snyder's-lance, has also come under increased regulatory scrutiny. our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various class and individual lawsuits in recent years. in the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. in addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims (even if untrue). furthermore, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the covid-19 pandemic, may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us.
increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial results the manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. various laws and regulations govern the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. in the u.s., we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including but not limited to the food and drug administration, the department of agriculture, the federal trade commission, the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency, as well as various state and local agencies. we are also regulated by similar agencies outside the u.s.
governmental and administrative bodies within the u.s. are considering a variety of tax, trade and other regulatory reforms. trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products. we regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and, consequently, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the u.s. and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.
changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts, serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in "financial statements and supplementary data," as well as the information contained in "risk factors."
unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to campbell soup company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
executive summary we are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories.
2020 illustrated the importance of a focused strategic plan and a dynamic team as we faced the unprecedented challenges of the covid-19 pandemic. the year can be viewed in two clear and separate halves. the first half of 2020 was a period of steady execution against our strategic roadmap. we began the year focused on strengthening our brand powerhouse, with two distinct divisions concentrated in north america: meals & beverages and snacks; each home to strong portfolios of products. we kicked off our "win in soup" strategic plan and completed our planned divestitures of our campbell international and european chips business, using the proceeds to reduce our leverage while implementing a new operating model to optimize growth and profitability. the groundwork we established in the first half of 2020 served as a springboard for the business into the second half of the year, when progress against our strategy accelerated as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
with the spread of the covid-19 pandemic in north america during the second half of 2020, we experienced significantly higher sales for our retail products in both our meals & beverages and snacks segments, especially in retail chains and large grocery supermarkets. this result was attributable to a change in retail demand, as consumers significantly increased their current food purchases for at-home consumption, which more than offset the declines in our foodservice business during the same period. we also saw elevated repeat purchase rates and new buyers of our products, especially in our soup business. the higher sales trends of our retail products may lessen or reverse in 2021 if customers or consumers alter their purchasing habits.
in response to increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020, we have taken steps, including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix, to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products. during the second half of 2020, we also experienced higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation and independent contractor payments, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards, which may continue or increase in 2021.
overall, we benefited from increased product demand and favorable product mix as we leveraged our supply chain assets to respond to the impact of the pandemic. consequently, our full-year results significantly exceeded our initial annual targets for net sales and earnings from continuing operations.
in 2019, we sold our u.s. refrigerated soup business, our garden fresh gourmet business and our bolthouse farms business. beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. these businesses were historically included in the campbell fresh reportable segment. a portion of the u.s. refrigerated soup business historically included in campbell fresh was retained and is now reported in meals & beverages.
as discussed above, we completed the sale of our kelsen business on september 23, 2019. on december 23, 2019, we completed the sale of our arnott's business and certain other international operations, including the simple meals and shelf-stable beverages businesses in australia and asia pacific (the arnott's and other international operations). beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of the kelsen business and the arnott's and other international operations (collectively referred to as campbell international) as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. these businesses were historically included in the snacks reportable segment. in addition, on october 11, 2019, we completed the sale of our european chips business. the results of the european chips business through the date of sale were reflected in continuing operations within the snacks reportable segment. see notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these divestitures and reportable segments.
through the fourth quarter of 2019, our retail business in latin america was managed as part of the meals & beverages segment. beginning in 2020, our business in latin america is managed as part of the snacks segment. segment results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.

strategy our strategy is to deliver profitable growth by focusing on our core brands in two divisions within north america while delivering on the promise of our purpose - real food that matters for life's moments. our strategic plan is based on four pillars: create a profitable growth model; fuel investments and margins with targeted cost savings; build a winning team and culture; and deliver on the promise of our purpose all as further discussed below.
we plan to continue to build upon our consumer and customer engagement models, which we believe will enhance our profitable growth model. we plan to do this through the development of more consumer-oriented product quality, marketing and innovation plans and prioritizing channels and retailers within our defined portfolio roles. in addition, we expect to continue to focus on the growth of our snacks business while also investing in u.s. soup and our other core brands.
we also expect to continue pursuing our multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of snyder's-lance, inc. (snyder's-lance). we expect to achieve these additional savings with continued network optimization, organization consolidation and integration, procurement savings and incremental savings opportunities across several cost categories. see "restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives" for additional information on these initiatives.
we also plan to focus on building a winning team and culture by improving our employee experience, advancing our inclusion and diversity strategy and investing in strategic capabilities that support our core brands in north america. in addition, we plan to continue to deliver on the promise of our purpose with consumer transparency initiatives, progress on our sustainability goals and strengthening our connection to the communities in which we operate.
business trends our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future, including: changing consumer preferences; a competitive and dynamic retail environment; and cost inflation.
our strategy is designed, in part, to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience. for example, we believe that consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume. we also expect consumers to continue to seek products that they associate with health and well-being, including naturally functional and organic foods as well as plant-based foods.
retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers. any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend. retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products, while other challenger brands drive innovation and engagement that threatens our market share.
the spread of the covid-19 pandemic in north america has led to shifts in the growth of the retail channels in which we sell our products. our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which prior to the pandemic, had experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. the covid-19 pandemic has shifted growth back to the traditional grocery trade. although there is significant uncertainty as to how the retail channels will perform in the future, we anticipate that the growth of e-commerce, including omnichannel click and collect models, as well as alternative retail channels, such as club and dollar stores, to continue.
the spread of the covid-19 pandemic also resulted in increased demand for our retail products, as consumers significantly increased their current food purchases for at-home consumption. in response to increased demand for our retail products during the second half of 2020, we have taken steps, including modifying production schedules and temporarily adjusting product mix, to increase our production capacity to meet the increased demand for our retail products. the continued spread of the covid-19 pandemic and any resulting government stay-at-home orders in the united states in 2021 may continue to drive consumer demand for our products, which may be in excess of our ability to supply. in mitigating supply chain risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic, we experienced higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation and independent contractor payments, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards, which may continue or increase in 2021.
the cost of distribution decreased in 2020 due to a decline in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess availability, warehousing efficiencies and lower fuel costs, however, we have experienced a recent increase in transportation and logistics costs. despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet increased demand for our products, certain ingredients and packaging, including steel, aluminum, glass, agricultural products, proteins and other commodities have been adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future with any certainty, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2021.

earnings from continuing operations were $474 million ($1.57 per share) in 2019, compared to $724 million ($2.40 per share) in 2018. after adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings decreased reflecting higher interest expense, partly offset by a lower adjusted tax rate as incremental earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) from the snyder's-lance acquisition were mostly offset by declines in ebit in the base business.

(2)sum of the individual amounts does not add due to rounding.
in 2020, meals & beverages sales increased 9%. excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, sales increased primarily due to gains in the u.s. retail business driven by u.s. soup, prego pasta sauces and v8 beverages, as well as gains in canada, partially offset by declines in foodservice. volume and mix increased in the retail business driven by covid-19, with increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption in the second half of 2020. the foodservice business was negatively impacted by shifts in consumer behavior and continued covid-19 related restrictions, as well as the loss of a refrigerated soup contract. including a 2-point benefit from the additional week, sales of u.s. soup increased 14% due to gains in condensed soups, ready-to-serve soups and broth.
in 2019, meals & beverages sales were comparable with prior year reflecting a 2-point benefit from the acquisition of pacific foods of oregon, llc (pacific foods), partially offset by declines in u.s. soup, the retail business in canada driven by the negative impact of currency translation and prego pasta sauces. excluding pacific foods, sales of u.s. soup decreased 2% due to declines in condensed and ready-to-serve soups, partly offset by gains in broth. the decline in u.s. soup was driven primarily by continued competitive pressure across the market as well as increased promotional spending.
in 2020, snacks sales increased 5%. excluding the impact of the european chips divestiture and the benefit of the 53rd week, sales increased driven by volume gains reflecting increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption in the second half of 2020, as well as base business performance. the sales increases reflect gains in goldfish crackers, pepperidge farm cookies and fresh bakery products, as well as kettle brand and cape cod potato chips, late july snacks and snyder's of hanover pretzels.
in 2019, snacks sales increased 62% with a 59-point benefit of the acquisition of snyder's-lance. excluding the impact of the acquisition of snyder's-lance, sales increased reflecting growth in pepperidge farm, with gains in goldfish crackers, fresh bakery products and in cookies, as well as kettle brand potato chips, late july snacks and snack factory pretzel crisps.
gross profit gross profit, defined as net sales less cost of products sold, increased by $306 million in 2020 from 2019 and increased by $319 million in 2019 from 2018. as a percent of sales, gross profit was 34.5% in 2020, 33.2% in 2019 and 35.9% in 2018.

(1)2020 includes an estimated positive margin impact of 1.3 from the benefit of cost savings initiatives and operating leverage, which was more than offset by cost inflation and other factors, including the impact of covid-19. 2019 includes a positive margin impact of 0.8 from cost savings initiatives, which was more than offset by cost inflation and other factors, including higher than expected distribution costs associated with the startup of a new distribution facility in findlay, ohio, operated by a third-party logistics provider.
marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 10.9% in 2020, 10.4% in 2019 and 11.0% in 2018. marketing and selling expenses increased 12% in 2020 from 2019. the increase was primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 14 percentage points); higher selling expenses (approximately 2 percentage points); higher incentive compensation (approximately 1 percentage point); and higher costs related to marketing overhead (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 5 percentage points) and lower costs associated with cost savings initiatives (approximately 1 percentage point). the increase in advertising and consumer promotion expenses was primarily in meals & beverages due to increased support of u.s. soup, and in snacks due to increased support of key brands.
marketing and selling expenses increased 16% in 2019 from 2018. the increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions (approximately 19 percentage points); higher incentive compensation (approximately 2 percentage points) and higher costs related to costs savings initiatives (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points) and lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 3 percentage points). the reduction in advertising and consumer promotion expenses was primarily in meals & beverages, reflecting a reallocation from advertising to promotional spending classified as revenue reductions, reduced support levels in light of distribution challenges faced in the first quarter and a later start to our u.s. soup campaign relative to 2018.
administrative expenses administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.2% in 2020, 7.5% in 2019 and 8.5% in 2018. administrative expenses increased 2% in 2020 from 2019. the increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation (approximately 4 percentage points); higher information technology costs (approximately 3 percentage points); higher inflation and general administrative costs (approximately 3 percentage points) and increases in charitable contributions (approximately 2 percentage points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 8 percentage points) and lower costs associated with cost savings initiatives (approximately 2 percentage points).
administrative expenses increased 8% in 2019 from 2018. the increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions (approximately 10 percentage points); higher incentive compensation (approximately 7 percentage points); and costs associated with the proxy contest (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by lower costs associated with cost savings initiatives inclusive of acquisition integration costs (approximately 7 percentage points) and increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points).

operating earnings from meals & beverages increased 10% in 2020 versus 2019. the increase was primarily due to sales volume gains, including the benefit of the additional week, and improved gross profit performance, partially offset by increased marketing support and higher administrative expenses. gross profit performance was impacted by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, as well as improved operating leverage and favorable product mix, partially offset by cost inflation and other supply chain costs, including covid-19 related costs incurred in the second half of 2020.
operating earnings from meals & beverages decreased 9% in 2019 versus 2018. the decrease was primarily due to higher levels of cost inflation and higher warehousing and transportation costs, as well as higher promotional spending and higher incentive compensation expenses, partly offset by supply chain productivity improvements, lower marketing and selling expenses and the benefits of cost savings initiatives.
operating earnings from snacks increased 6% in 2020 versus 2019. the increase primarily due to sales volume gains, including the benefit of the additional week, improved gross profit performance, partially offset by increased marketing support. gross profit performance was impacted by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, as well as favorable product mix and improved operating leverage, partially offset by cost inflation and other supply chain costs, including covid-19 related costs incurred in the second half of 2020.
operating earnings from snacks increased 33% in 2019 versus 2018. the increase reflects a 31-point benefit from the acquisition of snyder's-lance. the remaining increase was primarily due to higher sales, supply chain productivity improvements and lower promotional spending, partly offset by higher marketing and selling expenses, higher levels of cost inflation and higher incentive compensation expenses. operating earnings benefited from lapping the costs associated with the voluntary product recall of flavor blasted goldfish crackers in july 2018.

corporate in 2020 included the following:
•$121 million of losses on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments;
•a loss of $64 million from the sale of the european chips business;
•costs of $60 million related to the cost savings initiatives;
•a loss of $45 million on acre; and
•pension settlement charges of $43 million associated with u.s. and canadian pension plans.
corporate in 2019 included the following:
•$122 million of losses on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments;
•costs of $90 million related to the cost savings initiatives;
•a pension settlement charge of $28 million associated with a u.s. pension plan; and
•non-cash impairment charge of $16 million related to the european chips business.
corporate in 2018 included the following:
•costs of $135 million related to the cost savings initiatives;
•transaction and integration costs of $107 million associated with the acquisition of snyder's-lance;
•non-cash impairment charge of $54 million related to the plum trademark;
•$22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim; and
•$131 million of gains on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments.
excluding these amounts, the remaining decrease in costs in 2020 primarily reflects higher other income and lower administrative expenses.
excluding these amounts, the remaining increase in costs in 2019 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses.
interest expense interest expense decreased to $345 million in 2020 from $356 million in 2019. the decrease in interest expense was due to lower levels of debt and lower average interest rates on the debt portfolio, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of $75 million.
interest expense increased to $356 million in 2019 from $183 million in 2018. the increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of debt associated with funding the acquisitions, higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio and a gain of $18 million on treasury rate lock contracts in 2018 used to hedge the planned financing of the snyder's-lance acquisition.
taxes on earnings the effective tax rate was 22.7% in 2020, 24.2% in 2019 and 12.8% in 2018.
the decrease in the effective rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to the tax benefit on the sale of the european chips business.
on december 22, 2017, the act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation. as a result, the following items are reflected in 2018:
•the corporate rate reduction as of january 1, 2018, resulted in a blended u.s. statutory tax rate of approximately 27%;
•remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of $179 million; and
•imposition of a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings resulted in a tax charge of $53 million.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
tax expense increased from $106 million in 2018 to $151 million in 2019.
the following items impacted 2019 and 2018:
•in 2019, we recognized a tax benefit of $29 million on $122 million of pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market losses. in 2018, we recognized tax expense of $31 million on $131 million of pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market gains;
•in 2019, we recognized a $6 million tax benefit on $28 million of a pension settlement charge;
28
•in 2019, we recognized a $29 million tax benefit on $121 million of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs. in 2018, we recognized a $45 million tax benefit on $177 million of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs;
•in 2019, we recognized a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings of $2 million related to the enactment of the act. in 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $126 million related to the enactment of the act on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings described above;
•in 2019, we recognized a $3 million tax benefit on a $16 million impairment charge on the european chips business. in 2018, we recognized a $13 million tax benefit on a $54 million impairment charge on the plum trademark;
•in 2018, we recognized a $29 million tax benefit on $102 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of snyder's-lance; and
•in 2018, we recognized a $7 million tax benefit on the $22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim.
after adjusting for the items above, the remaining decrease in the effective rate in 2019 was primarily due to the ongoing benefit of the lower u.s. federal tax rate resulting from the enactment of the act.
restructuring charges and cost savings initiatives multi-year cost savings initiatives and snyder's-lance cost transformation program and integration beginning in fiscal 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure.
in recent years, we expanded these initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing networks, including closing our manufacturing facility in toronto, ontario, as well as our information technology infrastructure.
on march 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of snyder's-lance. prior to the acquisition, snyder's-lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. we continue to implement this program. in addition, we have identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrate snyder's-lance.
cost estimates, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed.
a summary of pre-tax charges recorded in earnings from continuing operations related to these initiatives is as follows:

as of april 28, 2019, we incurred substantially all of the costs for actions associated with discontinued operations. all of the costs were cash expenditures.
a summary of the pre-tax costs in earnings from continuing operations associated with the initiatives is as follows:
(millions)                                              recognized as of august 2, 2020

total                                                       $641
the total estimated pre-tax costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified are approximately $665 million to $690 million. this estimate will be updated as costs for the expanded initiatives are developed.
we expect the costs for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $215 million to $220 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $70 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $380 million to $400 million in implementation costs and other related costs. we expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: meals & beverages - approximately 33%; snacks - approximately 42%; and corporate - approximately 25%.
of the aggregate $665 million to $690 million of pre-tax costs associated with continuing operations identified to date, we expect approximately $585 million to $610 million will be cash expenditures. in addition, we expect to invest approximately $420 million in capital expenditures through 2022, of which we invested $336 million as of august 2, 2020. the capital expenditures primarily relate to the u.s. warehouse optimization project, improvement of quality, safety and cost structure across the snyder's-lance manufacturing network, implementation of an sap enterprise-resource planning system for snyder's-lance, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications, transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our u.s. thermal plants, insourcing of manufacturing for certain simple meal products, and optimization of the snyder's-lance warehouse and distribution network.
we expect to incur substantially all of the costs for the actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date through 2021 and to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.
we expect the initiatives for actions associated with continuing operations that have been identified to date to generate pre-tax savings of approximately $800 million to $810 million in 2021, and once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $850 million by the end of 2022. the annual pre-tax savings associated with continuing operations generated were as follows:

the initiatives for actions associated with discontinued operations generated pre-tax savings of over $90 million in 2019 and $60 million in 2018.

discontinued operations on february 25, 2019, we sold our u.s. refrigerated soup business, and on april 25, 2019, we sold our garden fresh gourmet business. proceeds were $55 million. on june 16, 2019, we sold our bolthouse farms business. proceeds were $500 million. beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of these businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. these businesses were historically included in the campbell fresh reportable segment.

we completed the sale of our kelsen business on september 23, 2019, for $322 million. we also completed the sale of the arnott's and other international operations on december 23, 2019, for $2,286 million. the purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in $4 million of additional proceeds in the third quarter of 2020. beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have reflected the results of operations of the kelsen business and the arnott's and other international operations, or campbell international, as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. these businesses were historically included in the snacks reportable segment.

in 2020, campbell international sales and earnings from operations decreased reflecting the sales of the businesses.
the sale of the arnott's and other international operations resulted in a substantial capital gain for tax purposes. we were able to utilize capital losses, which were offset with valuation allowances as of july 28, 2019, to offset the capital gain.
in 2019, campbell international sales decreased reflecting the negative impact of currency translation and declines in kelsen cookies in the u.s.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $7 million on a trademark and $10 million on goodwill in kelsen due to a lower long-term outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business.
in 2019, excluding items impacting comparability, earnings from campbell international declined primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage, reflecting higher supply chain costs and higher promotional spending, as well as the negative impact of currency translation.
in 2019, campbell fresh sales decreased primarily due to the sale of the businesses, as well as declines in refrigerated soup, bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and garden fresh gourmet.
in 2019 and 2018, we recorded impairment charges on the reporting units in campbell fresh. see "significant accounting estimates" for additional information. in 2019, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $360 million ($275 million after tax, or $.91 per share). in 2018, the total non-cash impairment charges were $694 million ($571 million after tax, or $1.89 per share). in 2019, we incurred pre-tax expenses of $32 million associated with the sale process of the businesses, including transaction costs. in addition, we recorded tax expense of $29 million in the third quarter as deferred tax assets associated with bolthouse farms were not realizable. in 2018, loss from operations included a benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.
liquidity and capital resources we expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.
we generated cash flows from operations of $1,396 million in 2020, compared to $1,398 million in 2019. the decline in 2020 was primarily due to changes in working capital, mostly offset by higher cash earnings and lower other cash payments.
we generated cash flows from operations of $1,398 million in 2019, compared to $1,305 million in 2018. the increase in 2019 was primarily due to improvements in working capital management efforts and higher cash earnings.
current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements. we had negative working capital of $690 million as of
31
august 2, 2020, and $1,418 million as of july 28, 2019. total debt maturing within one year was $1,202 million as of august 2, 2020, and $1,603 million as of july 28, 2019.
capital expenditures were $299 million in 2020, $384 million in 2019 and $407 million in 2018. capital expenditures in 2020 were lower than 2019 reflecting delays in certain projects impacted by the spread of the covid-19 pandemic. capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $350 million in 2021. capital expenditures in 2020 included the implementation of an sap enterprise-resource planning system for snyder's-lance, a milano cookie capacity expansion project, chip capacity expansion projects, and a goldfish cracker capacity expansion project. capital expenditures in 2019 included a u.s. warehouse optimization project, replacement of a pepperidge farm refrigeration system, transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our u.s. thermal plants, a snyder's-lance regional distribution center, a milano cookie capacity expansion project, and a goldfish cracker capacity expansion project. capital expenditures in 2018 included a u.s. warehouse optimization project; transition of production of the toronto manufacturing facility to our u.s. thermal plants; insourcing manufacturing for certain simple meal products; replacement of a pepperidge farm refrigeration system; and an australian multi-pack biscuit capacity expansion project.
pepperidge farm and snyder's-lance have a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. in order to maintain and expand this model, we routinely purchase and sell routes. the purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities.
primarily in response to the impact of the covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing uncertainty surrounding the operating environment and the commercial paper market, as well as favorable credit markets at the time, on april 24, 2020, we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000 million, consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 2.375% per annum, due april 24, 2030, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 3.125% per annum, due april 24, 2050. on may 1, 2020, we used $300 million of the net proceeds to repay $300 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we intend to use the remaining net proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper as it comes due and for general corporate purposes, thereby lessening our reliance on commercial paper. the 2.375% senior notes due 2030 and the 3.125% senior notes due 2050 may each be redeemed at the applicable redemption price, in whole or in part, at our option at any time and from time to time prior to january 24, 2030, and october 24, 2049, respectively. interest on each of the notes is due semi-annually on april 24 and october 24, commencing on october 24, 2020. the notes contain customary covenants and events of default. if a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date.

off-balance sheet arrangements and other commitments we guarantee approximately 2,100 bank loans made to pepperidge farm independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. the maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $246 million. we guarantee approximately 2,500 bank loans made to snyder's-lance independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. the maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $199 million. our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. we do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.
inflation we are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold. we use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives.
market risk sensitivity the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. in addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. net sales of continuing operations outside of the u.s. are concentrated principally in canada and represent approximately 6% of 2020 net sales. within discontinued operations, international sales were concentrated principally in australia. we manage our foreign currency exposures by utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts and borrowing in various foreign currencies. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments.
we principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. we also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, soybean oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, cocoa, aluminum, soybean meal and corn.

the aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of $1 million as of august 2, 2020. as of july 28, 2019, the total notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding was $323 million, including $83 million associated with discontinued operations, and the aggregate fair value was a loss of $3 million.
we enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. as of august 2, 2020, the notional value of these contracts was $137 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $2 million. as of july 28, 2019, the notional value of these contracts was $183 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $3 million.
we enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock, the total return of the vanguard institutional index institutional plus shares, and the total return of the vanguard total international stock index. under these contracts, we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either: the total return on our capital stock; the total return of the standard & poor's 500 index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard institutional index institutional plus shares; or the total return of the ishares msci eafe index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard total international stock index. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was $6 million at august 2, 2020, and $7 million at july 28, 2019. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in june 2021, was 0.93% at august 2, 2020. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the standard & poor's 500 index was $13 million at august 2, 2020, and $17 million at july 28, 2019. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in march 2021, was 0.53% at august 2, 2020. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the ishares msci eafe index was $3 million at august 2, 2020, and $7 million at july 28, 2019. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in march 2021, was 0.63% at august 2, 2020. the fair value of these contracts was a gain of $4 million as of august 2, 2020, and a gain of $1 million as of july 28, 2019.
our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.
significant accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions:
trade and consumer promotion programs - we offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. the mix between these forms of variable consideration, which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans. the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors, including expected volume. typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. however, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates. we adopted revised guidance on the recognition of revenue in the first quarter of 2019. see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
valuation of long-lived assets - fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. undiscounted cash flow
35
analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. if impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. we may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital, and future economic and market conditions. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the reporting unit to fair value.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital, and assumed royalty rates. if the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value.
2018 assessments discontinued operations during the second quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations. the business was impacted by adverse weather conditions and the implementation of enhanced quality protocols, which impacted crop yields and resulted in higher costs. this cost volatility continued to be higher than expected and caused us to reassess our short- and long-term margin expectations for this business. based on this performance, we reduced our outlook for future operating margins and discounted cash flows, which resulted in a $75 million impairment charge, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit. the fair value of the trademark exceeded the carrying value, which was $48 million.
during the third quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the deli reporting unit, which includes garden fresh gourmet and the u.s. refrigerated soup business. during the third quarter of 2018, certain of our private label refrigerated soup customers, which represented a majority of the business, informed us of their intention to in-source production beginning in 2019, and the sales and operating profit outlook of the garden fresh gourmet business was reduced. due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with these customers, as well as the performance of the garden fresh gourmet business, we revised the long-term outlook for future sales, operating margins and discounted cash flows for this reporting unit, which resulted in an $81 million impairment charge on goodwill, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit, $13 million on a trademark, and $11 million on plant assets in the reporting unit.
in addition, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit as the operating performance in the third quarter was below expectations. we assessed sales performance of refrigerated beverages and key drivers impacting gross profit for the unit. we revised our long-term outlook for future earnings and discounted cash flows to reflect reduced sales expectations to modest growth and decreased our gross profit outlook to reflect the inflation and manufacturing efficiency pressures that remained with the unit. this revised outlook resulted in a $384 million impairment charge on goodwill, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit, and $130 million on a trademark in the reporting unit.
continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $54 million on the plum trademark. in 2018, sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. in the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook for future sales.
2019 assessments discontinued operations on august 30, 2018, we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of our international biscuits and snacks operating segment and the campbell fresh operating segment. as we continued to pursue the divestiture of these businesses and as we received initial indications of value, in the second quarter of 2019, we performed interim impairment assessments on the intangible and tangible assets within campbell fresh, which included garden fresh gourmet, bolthouse farms carrot and
36
carrot ingredients, and bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. as a result, we revised our future outlook for earnings and cash flows for each of these businesses.
within bolthouse farms carrot and carrot ingredients, we recorded impairment charges of $18 million on the trademark, and $159 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets. within bolthouse farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, we recorded impairment charges of $74 million on the trademark, and $31 million on the plant assets and amortizable intangible assets. on garden fresh gourmet, we recorded impairment charges of $23 million on the trademark and $39 million on customer relationships, which eliminated the carrying value of these assets, and $2 million on plant assets.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $7 million on a trademark and $10 million on goodwill in kelsen due to a lower long-term outlook for sales and the pending sale of the business. on july 12, 2019, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our kelsen business. we sold the business on september 23, 2019.
see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations.
continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed an assessment on the assets within our european chips business and recorded an impairment charge of $16 million on intangible assets. this business was included in the snacks segment and reporting unit.
2020 assessments continuing operations as of august 2, 2020, the carrying value of goodwill was $3,986 million. based on our assessments, all of our reporting units had an excess fair value well over the carrying value.
as of august 2, 2020, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $2,611 million, including $1,978 million associated with snyder's-lance. of the carrying value of all indefinite-lived trademarks, $620 million related to the snyder's of hanover trademark, $292 million related to the pace trademark, $280 million related to the pacific foods trademark and $61 million related to the plum trademark. holding all other assumptions constant, changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of these trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately:
(millions)   various snyder's-lance        pace          pacific foods        plum
1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital   $(10)                         $(5)          $-                   $(5)

the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. the actual cash flows could differ materially from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.
if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential additional impairment charges could result. we will continue to monitor the valuation of our long-lived assets.
see also note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.
pension and postretirement benefits - we provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, perform the required calculations to determine expense.
the discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date. in establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. in addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. beginning in 2018, we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense (income). we elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows. previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. this change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations. we accounted for this change prospectively in 2018 as a change in
37
accounting estimate. as a result of this change, net periodic benefit income increased by approximately $17 million in 2018, compared to what the net periodic benefit income would have been under the previous method.
the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date.
net periodic pension and postretirement expense (income) was $93 million in 2020, $103 million in 2019 and ($185) million in 2018.
significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:
2020                                                                   2019                 2018
pension discount rate for benefit obligations            2.47%                3.46%                4.15%
expected return on plan assets                   6.01%                6.85%                6.86%
postretirement discount rate for obligations                    2.15%                3.28%                4.06%
initial health care trend rate                   6.25%                6.25%                6.75%
ultimate health care trend rate                  4.50%                4.50%                4.50%
estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately $9 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately $120 million. a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $10 million. a one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would not result in an immediate loss.
contributions to pension plans were $2 million in 2020, and $5 million in 2019 and 2018. contributions to pension plans are not expected to be material in 2021.
see also note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits.
income taxes - the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management's estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
on december 22, 2017, the act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation, including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, and transitioning to a territorial system for taxation on foreign earnings along with the imposition of a transition tax in 2018 on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings.

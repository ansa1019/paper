general operating comments
2020 marked the company's 23rd consecutive year of increased revenues. revenues for the year rose 7.2 percent to
$2.161 billion compared to $2.015 billion for the prior year. income before income taxes increased 35.8% to $354.7
million compared to $261.2 million the prior year. net income increased 28.3% to $260.8 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.53 compared to $203.3 million, or $0.41 per diluted share for the prior year. the drop in net income from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributed to the pension settlement loss recorded in 2019.
covid-19 pandemic impact as the pandemic challenges grew early in 2020, the company made numerous operational adjustments to address the economic, health and safety challenges from the covid-19 pandemic. these included new covid-related procedures, modified customer service and related protocols, daily health screenings before entering shared offices, and a transition to remote work locations to reduce concentrations of personnel in offices where appropriate. cost containment efforts included furloughs, layoffs, elimination of non-essential travel, postponing capital expenditures, and temporary salary reductions for upper management, among other actions.
customer retention during the pandemic is less predictable, and of greater immediate concern compared with our normal operations, however, our residential pest and termite control business has remained reasonably consistent with some growth over prior years. with many sheltering or working from home, we have experienced higher than normal demand for our residential services. our commercial pest control business has been more adversely impacted, as it crosses multiple industries such as healthcare, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail and hospitality.
each of these industries is being impacted differently by the pandemic. many of our commercial customers continue to operate as "essential" businesses; however, unfortunately there are a notable number of others that have closed, at least temporarily. we expect this impact will persist through much of 2021 until the majority of the population has been vaccinated against the virus. the company's residential and termite revenues grew 13.4% and 9.6%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019 while our commercial pest control revenues fell by 0.5%.
18
while we have a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet, based on our revenue growth this year, we do not anticipate any significant long-term loss in revenues or cash flows that would approach a level for impairment of intangible assets.
all of our critical supply-chain vendors have remained operational, and we have engaged additional new sources to supplement our existing suppliers, especially for critical ppe and other covid-19 related items. fleet suppliers and support vendors continue to serve our needs.
results of operations-2020 versus 2019
overview the company's revenues increased to $2.161 billion in 2020, a 7.2% increase compared to 2019. gross margin increased to 51.5% for 2020 from 50.7% in 2019. sales, general and administrative expense were 30.4% of revenues in
2020 compared to 30.9% in 2019. the company's depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of revenue increased 2.5% to 4.1% in 2020 compared to 4.0% in 2019. rollins' net income of $260.8 million in 2020 was an increase of $57.5 million, or 28.3%, compared to $203.3 million in 2019. net profit margin improved to 12.1% in
2020 from 10.1% in 2019. rollins continued to expand our global brand recognition with acquisitions in the united states, canada, united kingdom, australia, and asia as well as expanded our orkin international franchise program in numerous countries around the globe. the company continues to seek new international opportunities.
revenues revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 were $2.161 billion, an increase of $145.7 million, or 7.2%, from
2019 revenues of $2.015 billion. growth accounted for approximately 3.8% of our increase, and our acquisitions contributed the remaining revenue growth. we experienced strong growth in residential pest control, increasing
13.4%, while termite and ancillary revenues grew 9.6%. year over year commercial revenues were down 0.5% as commercial pest control was negatively impacted by the covid-19 virus due to various levels of government-driven shutdowns. the company's revenue mix for the year ended december 31, 2020 consisted primarily of 45% residential pest control, 36% commercial pest control and 19% termite and ancillary revenues (such as moisture control, insulation, deck and gutter work).
during 2020, the company chose to forgo the normal mid-year price increase, which historically contributes approximately 1.0% to our annual revenue growth. approximately 80% of the company's pest control revenue was recurring in 2020, as well as in 2019.
the company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% and 8% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the company established new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2020 while closing or acquiring others, for a total of 94 orkin international franchises and nine australia franchises at december 31, 2020, compared to 97 orkin international franchises, one canadian critter control franchises and ten australia franchises at december 31, 2019. the australia franchises operate under the murray pest control and scientific pest management names.
revenue from franchising was up 5.6% in 2020 compared to 2019 as the company continued to expand orkin's international footprint and recognition of initial franchise fees. international and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the company's revenues for 2020. orkin had 143 and 147 franchises (domestic and international)
at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the company continued its strategy of buying back critter control franchises during 2020, resulting in a drop in franchises to 79 at december 31, 2020, compared to 85 at december
31, 2019.
cost of services provided for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, cost of services provided increased $55.0 million, or 5.5%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2019. gross margin for the year increased to 51.5% for 2020 from 50.7% in
2019. margin improvements were driven primarily from lower service wage growth compared to revenue growth, and from fleet savings driven by improvements in our routing and scheduling efficiencies and lower fuel prices.
19
depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, depreciation and amortization increased $7.2 million, or 8.9%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2019. the dollar increase was primarily due to depreciation increasing $4.0 million, or 10.9%, from the depreciation of acquired and purchased assets and depreciation from various it related projects. amortization of intangible assets increased $3.2 million, or 7.3%, for 2020 due to the additional amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions over the last year, including a full year of amortization for clark pest control acquired in april 2019, as well as several smaller foreign and domestic companies.
sales, general and administrative for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, sales, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $32.8
million, or 5.3%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2019. sg&a decreased to 30.4% of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to 30.9% in 2019. the company eliminated any non-essential spending at the start of the pandemic which lowered expenses in several areas. travel restrictions reduced typical training, site visits and conference costs. conversely, we incurred higher than normal expenses in 2019 related to acquisition preparation and integration activities for clark pest control.
gain / loss on sales of assets, net the company recorded a $1.6 million net loss on sales of assets for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to a net gain on sales of assets of $0.6 million in 2019. the company's 2020 losses came primarily from liquidating the pension plan assets from the 2019 pension plan settlement. during 2019, the company recorded gains from the sale of owned vehicles and other owned property.
interest expense, net interest expense, net for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 was $5.1 million and $6.9 million respectively, driven largely by borrowings to fund acquisitions, among other things.
taxes the company's effective tax rate increased to 26.5% in 2020 compared to 22.1% in 2019, due primarily to state and foreign income tax changes and limited tax deductibility for the accelerated stock vesting expense recognized in
2020. the 2019 rate was lower due to beneficial adjustments related to the 2019 pension settlement.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow cash from operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses.
the most significant source of cash in rollins' cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from services sold. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.

related projects. the company expects to invest between $25.0 million and $30.0 million in 2021 in capital expenditures. during 2020, the company and its subsidiaries acquired mccall pest management, inc, the remaining clark pest control locations, and adam's pest control in australia as well as several other small to mid-sized companies for a total of $147.6 million compared to $430.6 million and $76.8 million in acquisitions during 2019

critical accounting policies and estimates the company views critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:
22
accrual for termite contracts-the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company's business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers'
compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary on a semi-
annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post incident drug testing, increased driver training and post-
injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.
revenue recognition-the company's revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for refunds and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
more on the company's revenue recognition policy can be found in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies with the heading revenue recognition.
contingency accruals-the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification
("asc") topic 450 "contingencies,"management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations. contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
recent accounting guidance see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.

our actual results could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks, timing and uncertainties including, without limitation, the failure to maintain and enhance our brands and develop a positive client reputation; our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights; actions taken by our franchisees, subcontractors or vendors that may harm our business; general economic conditions; the impact of the extent and duration of economic contraction related to covid-19 on general economic activity for the remainder of 2021 and beyond; the impact of future developments related to the covid-19
pandemic on the company's business, results of operations, accounting assumptions and estimates and financial condition; potential increases in labor costs; our inability to attract and retain skilled workers; competitive factors and pricing practices; changes in industry practices or technologies; the degree of success of our termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment methods; our ability to identify and integrate potential acquisitions; unsuccessful expansion into international markets; climate and weather trends; a breach of data security resulting in the unauthorized access of personal, financial, or other data or information about our customers, employees, third parties, or of our proprietary confidential information; damage to our brands or reputation; possibility of an adverse ruling against us in pending litigation, regulatory action or investigation;
changes in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations; the effectiveness of our risk management and safety program; general market risk; management's substantial ownership interest and its impact on public stockholders and the availability of the company's common stock to the investing public; and the existence of certain anti-takeover provisions in our governance documents, which could make a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company's board of directors more difficult or expensive. all of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond our ability to control, and in many cases, we cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. the company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements.
item 7a.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company maintained an investment portfolio (included in cash and cash equivalents) subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. the company is subject to interest rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $175.0
million revolving credit facility and $250.0 million term loan facility. as of december 31, 2020, the revolving commitment had outstanding borrowings of $67.0 million and the term loan had outstanding borrowings of $136.0

critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
accrued insurance - workers' compensation and vehicle liability as described further in note 1 to the financial statements, the company retains, up to certain policy-specified limits, certain risks related to workers' compensation and vehicle liability. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss programs are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported
(although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims.
we identified accrued insurance - workers' compensation and vehicle liability and related expense ("accrued insurance")
as a critical audit matter.
the principal considerations for our determination that accrued insurance is a critical audit matter are that accrued insurance liability has higher risk of estimation uncertainty due to the loss development factors and inherent assumptions in actuarial methods used in determining the required liability. the estimation uncertainty and complexity of the actuarial methods utilized involved especially subjective auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve an auditor-engaged actuarial specialist.
our audit procedures related to the accrued insurance reserve included the following, among others:
obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested operating effectiveness of key controls relating to accrued insurance, including, but not limited to, controls that (1) validate
•  that claims were reported and submitted accurately and timely, (2) validate the underlying data maintained by the company and the third-party administrator used to develop the accrued insurance reserve was complete and accurate, and (3) verify the third-party actuarial report used in developing the accrued insurance reserve was reviewed by the company's management.
utilized an auditor-engaged specialist in evaluating management's methods and assumptions,
•  including the reasonableness of the selected loss development factors utilized by management, as well as performing a retrospective review to validate the assumptions utilized by management, to identify indicators of potential bias.
tested
•  the underlying data maintained by the company and the third-party administrator, which was submitted to the company's actuary to develop the accrued insurance reserve, for completeness and accuracy.

principles of consolidation-the company's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of rollins, inc.
and the company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("gaap"). the company does not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it has an ownership interest of 50% or less. the company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. accordingly, the company has not consolidated any variable interest entity. the company reclassified certain prior period amounts, none of which were material, to conform to the current period presentation. all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
subsequent events-the company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued.
estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements-the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.
revenue recognition-the company's revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
nature of goods and services and performance obligations the company contracts with its customers to provide the following goods and services, each of which is a distinct performance obligation:
pest control services -rollins provides pest control services to protect residential and commercial properties from common pests, including rodents and insects. pest control generally consists of assessing a customer's property for conditions that invite pests, tackling current infestations, and stopping the life cycle to prevent future invaders. revenue from pest control services is recognized as services are rendered.
36
the company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues upon satisfaction of the performance obligation at the time services are performed. for certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, we use estimates as described below. residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. in general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. the company defers recognition of advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. the company classifies discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.
termite control services -rollins provides both traditional and baiting termite protection services. traditional termite protection uses "termidor" liquid treatment and/or dry foam and orkin foam to treat voids and spaces around the property, while baiting termite protection uses baits to disrupt the molting process termites require for growth and offers ongoing protection. revenue from initial termite treatment services is recognized as services are provided.
maintenance/monitoring/inspection -in connection with the initial service offerings, rollins provides recurring maintenance, monitoring or inspection services to help protect consumer's property from any future sign of termite activities after the original treatment. this recurring service is a service-type warranty under asc 606 as it is routinely sold and purchased separately from the initial treatment services and is typically purchased or renewed annually.
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the transfer of control of the individual units of accounting. at the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring performance obligation. this portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue that depicts the company's performance in transferring control of the service. the allocation of the transaction price to the two deliverables is based on the relative stand-alone selling price. there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that depicts the company's performance in transferring control of the service.
revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term that depicts the company's performance in transferring control of the service; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. for outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. as the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. the company accrues for noticed claims. the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.
miscellaneous services -in certain agreements with customers, rollins may offer other miscellaneous services, including restroom cleaning (eliminating foul odors, grease and grime which could attract pests) and training
(seminars covering good manufacturing practices and product stewardship). revenue from miscellaneous services is recognized when services are provided.
products -depending on customer demand, rollins may separately sell pest control and/or termite protection products, such as traps. revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of the asset.
equipment rental (or lease) -depending on customer demand, rollins may lease certain pest control and/or termite protection equipment. revenues from equipment rentals are recognized over the period of the rental/lease. revenues from equipment rentals represent less than 1.0% of the company's revenues for each reported period.
right to access intellectual property (franchise) -the right to access rollins' intellectual property is an essential part of orkin's franchising agreements. these agreements provide the franchisee (the customer) a license to use the rollins' name and trademark when advertising and selling services to end customers in their normal course of business. orkin franchise agreements contain a clause allowing orkin to purchase certain assets of the franchisee. this is only an offer for orkin to re-purchase the assets originally provided by orkin to the franchisee and is not a performance obligation or a form of consideration. international and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1.0% of the company's annual revenues.
37
all orkin domestic franchises have a guaranteed repurchase clause that the orkin franchise may be repurchased by orkin at a later date once it has been established. the company amortizes the initial franchise fee over the initial franchise term. deferred orkin franchise fees were $ 1.6million and $ 1.7million for the year ending december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
royalties from orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues are earned on a monthly basis. revenue from orkin franchises was $ 9.4million for the year ended december 31, 2020 and $ 8.7million and $ 8.8million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
contract balances timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we record unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to billing. unearned revenue mainly relates to the company's termite baiting offering, conventional renewals, and year-in-advance pest control services for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. for multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. refer to note 3 - revenue for further information, including changes in unearned revenue for the year.
the company extends terms to certain customers on higher dollar termite and ancillary work, as well as to certain franchisees for initial funding on the sale of franchises. these financed receivables are segregated from our trade receivables. the amounts that are due within one year from the balance sheet dates are classified as short-term financed receivables, and are shown, net of allowance for expected credit losses, at $23.7 million as of december
31, 2020 and $22.3 million at december 31, 2019. the balances of long-term financed receivables, net of allowance for expected credit losses, were $38.2 million as of december 31, 2020 and $30.8 million at december 31, 2019 and are included in long-term assets on our consolidated statements of financial position. see note 6 - financing receivables for further information.
the allowance for expected credit losses reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for expected credit losses can be found on schedule ii-
valuation and qualifying accounts.
payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. in instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing.
practical expedients and exemptions we generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. these costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.
we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. all revenues are reported net of sales taxes.
the company's international operations accounted for approximately 7% and 8% of revenues for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
allowance for expected credit losses- the company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses accounts based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable. management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectability of accounts receivable. substantially all of the company's receivables are due from pest control and termite services in the united states and selected international locations. the company's allowance for expected credit losses is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. the company's established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. provisions for expected credit losses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. accounts are written-off against the allowance for expected credit losses when the company determines that amounts are uncollectible, and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery. therefore, the provision for expected credit losses can fluctuate significantly from period to period. there were no large recoveries in 2020, 2019, and 2018. we record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. if circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.

cash held in foreign bank accounts    $  71,330    $  74,094    $  53,613
the company's $98.5 million of total cash at december 31, 2020, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. approximately $71.3 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $27.2 million is primarily held in federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") insured non-interest-
bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times may exceed federally insured amounts.
the company's international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. repatriation of cash from the company's foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the company's current business plan.
rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business for the foreseeable future.
marketable securities- from time to time, the company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial institutions. the company's investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than
"investment grade" by national rating services.
management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. debt securities are classified as available-for-sale because the company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity. available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as in earnings.
the company had no marketable securities other than those held in the defined benefit pension plan and the non-
qualified deferred compensation plan at december 31, 2020 and 2019. see note 16 for further details.
materials and supplies- materials and supplies are stated at the lower cost of cost or market. cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method.
income taxes-the company provides for income taxes based on fasb asc topic 740 "income taxes", which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. the company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. the company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold.
the company's policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
39
equipment and property- equipment and property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. annual provisions for depreciation are computed using the following asset lives: buildings, 10 to 40 years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, 2 to 10 years. expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. the cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. the annual provisions for depreciation, below, have been reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the line item entitled depreciation and amortization.

impairment of long-lived assets-in accordance with the fasb asc topic 360, "property, plant and equipment", the company's long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. we periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including customer contracts and assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.
goodwill and other intangible assets- in accordance with the fasb asc topic 350, "intangibles - goodwill and other", the company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill.
the company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives or goodwill. goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. such conditions may include an economic downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. the company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the company level.
such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the company)
with its carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value, the company recognizes a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. the company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. the company recognizes an impairment charge if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. the company completed its most recent annual impairment analysis as of september 30, 2020. based upon the results of these analyses, the company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated.
accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers'
compensation and vehicle liability. risks above specified limits are managed through either high deductible insurance or a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and recent claims and trends. management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events.
40
accrual for termite contracts-the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company's business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. an accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
contingency accruals-the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the fasb asc topic 450 "contingencies,"management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations.
contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position three-for-two stock split-the board of directors at its quarterly meeting on october 27, 2020, authorized a three-
for-two stock split by the issuance on december 10, 2020 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at november 10, 2020. all share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes are restated for the three-for-two stock split.
earnings per share-the fasb asc topic 260-10 "earnings per share-overall,"requires a basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share presentation. further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.
the company has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered participating securities. see note 17 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.
the basic and diluted calculations are the same as we have no stock options or other potentially dilutive instruments outstanding. basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods.

translation of foreign currencies-assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than u.s. dollars are translated into u.s. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. the resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign currency are included in the earnings of the current period.
stock-based compensation- the company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the fasb asc topic 718 " compensation - stock compensation." time lapse restricted shares (tlrss) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the company's employee stock incentive plan.
tlrss provide for the issuance of a share of the company's common stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. outstanding tlrss vest in 20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. during these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. the agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed. the fair value of these awards is recognized as compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over six years.
comprehensive income (loss)-other comprehensive income (loss) results from foreign currency translations, minimum pension liability adjustments and cash flow hedge of interest rate risks.
franchising program- rollins' wholly-owned subsidiary, orkin systems, llc, had 49, 50and 47domestic franchises as of december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. transactions with orkin's domestic franchises involve sales of territories and customer contracts to establish new orkin franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. the territories, customer contracts and initial orkin franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes due over periods ranging up to five years. notes receivable from orkin domestic franchises were $ 5.8million at december 31, 2020 and $ 6.7million at december 31, 2019. the company amortizes the orkin domestic initial domestic franchise fees over the initial franchise term. deferred orkin domestic franchise fees were $ 1.6million at december 31, 2020 and $ 1.7million december 31, 2019. these notes receivable are included as financing receivables and the deferred franchise fees are included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position. the company's maximum exposure to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to orkin's domestic franchises was $ 4.2million, $ 5.0million, and $ 4.9million for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
42
as of december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, orkin had 94, 97, and 86international franchises, respectively. orkin's international franchise program began with its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to central and south america, the caribbean, the middle east, asia, europe, and africa.
royalties from orkin franchises (domestic and international) are accrued and recognized as revenues, and are earned on a monthly basis. revenue from orkin franchises (domestic and international) was $ 9.4million for the year ended december 31, 2020 and $ 8.7million and $ 8.8million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

right to access intellectual property (franchise)- the right to access orkin's, critter control's and our australia franchisors' intellectual property is an essential part of our franchise agreements. these agreements provide the franchisee a license to use the brand name and trademark when advertising and selling services to end customers in their normal course of business. orkin and critter control franchise agreements contain a clause allowing the respective franchisor to purchase certain assets of the franchisee at the conclusion of their franchise agreement or upon termination. this is only an option for the franchisor to re-purchase the assets selected by the franchisor and is not a performance obligation or a form of consideration.
recent accounting guidance recently adopted accounting standards in june of 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, "financial instruments - credit losses (asc 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments." the updated accounting guidance requires changes to the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments not accounted for at fair value through net income. the company adopted asu
2016-13 effective january 1, 2020 and recognized the decrease in the allowance for expected credit losses, net of tax, as a $2.5 million increase to beginning retained earnings.
the company is exposed to credit losses primarily related to accounts receivable and financed receivables derived from customer services revenue. to reduce credit risk for residential pest control accounts receivable, we promote enrollment in our auto-pay programs. in general, we may suspend future services for customers with past due balances. the company's credit risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising rollins' customer base and dispersion across many different geographical regions.
43
the company manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. the company's established credit evaluation and monitoring procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. the credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on an assessment of the individual's beacon/credit bureau score. rollins requires a potential obligor to have good creditworthiness with low risk before entering into a contract. depending upon the individual's credit score, the company may accept with 100% financing or require a significant down payment or turn down the contract.
delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. financing receivables include installment receivable amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates.
the company's allowances for credit losses for trade accounts receivable and financed receivables are developed using historical collection experience, the current aging of receivables, and consideration of current economic and market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to the collection of receivables. below is a roll-forward of the company's allowance for credit losses for the year ended december 31, 2020.

in january 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-04, intangibles-goodwill and other (asc 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, which eliminated the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. instead, entities would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on the previous step 1). the company adopted asu 2017-04 effective january 1, 2020. the adoption of this standard had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in august 2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-13, fair value measurement (asc 820): disclosure framework-changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement. the updated accounting guidance modified the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements by removing certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifying existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adding new disclosure requirements. the company adopted asu 2018-13 effective january 1, 2020 and the adoption did not materially impact its financial statement disclosures.
recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2021 or later in december 2019, the fasb issued asu no. 2019-12 income taxes (topic 740): simplifying the accounting for income taxes. the standard eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period (1) exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation (2) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments and (3) exceptions in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. the asu also is designed to improve financial statement preparers' application of income tax-related guidance and simplify gaap for (1) franchise taxes that are partially based on income, (2) transactions with a government that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, (3) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax, and (4) enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. the standard in this update is effective for the company's financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning in 2021. the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.

million to customer contracts, and $49.8 million to other intangible assets, principally tradenames. the finite-
lived intangible assets, principally customer contracts, are being amortized over periods principally ranging from
5 to 10 years on a straight-lined basis.

6. financing receivables rollins manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. the company's credit risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising rollins' customer base and dispersion across many different geographical regions. the credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on an assessment of the individual's beacon/credit bureau score. rollins requires a potential obligor to have good creditworthiness with low risk before entering into a contract. depending upon the individual's credit score, the company may accept with 100%financing or require a significant down payment or turndown the contract. delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. financing receivables include installment receivable amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates.

net financing receivables                  $  61,903       $  53,059
total financing receivables, net were $61.9 million and $53.1 million at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively. financing receivables are generally charged-off when deemed uncollectable or when 180days have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment. the company's charge-off policy has been consistently applied during the periods reported. management considers the charge-off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for expected credit losses. gross charge-offs as a percentage of average financing receivables were 4.6%and 5.0%for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively. due to the low percentage of charge-off receivables and the high creditworthiness of the potential obligor, the entire rollins, inc. financing receivables portfolio has a low credit risk.
the company offers 90days same-as-cash financing to some customers based on their creditworthiness. interest is not recognized until the 91st day at which time it is calculated retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. in certain circumstances, such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest when they reach 180days past due. as of december 31, 2020, there were 2
accounts that were greater than 180 days past due, which have been fully reserved.
48
included in financing receivables are notes receivable from franchise owners. the majority of these notes are low risk as the repurchase of these franchises is guaranteed by the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, orkin systems, llc, and the repurchase price of the franchise is currently estimated and has historically been well above the receivable due from the franchise owner. also included in notes receivables are franchise notes from other brands which are not guaranteed and do not have the same historical valuation.
the carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates for these types of contracts. long-term installment receivables, net were $38.2 million and $30.8 million at december
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
rollins establishes an allowance for expected credit losses to ensure financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. the allowance balance is comprised of a general reserve, which is determined based on a percentage of the financing receivables balance, and a specific reserve, which is established for certain accounts with identified exposures, such as customer default, bankruptcy or other events, that make it unlikely that rollins will recover its investment. the general reserve percentages are based on several factors, which include consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the portfolio and information derived from competitive benchmarking.
the allowance for expected credit losses related to financing receivableswas as follows at december 31,                        2020            2019

11. derivative instruments and hedging activities risk management objective of using derivatives the company is exposed to certain interest rate risks on our outstanding debt and foreign currency risks arising from our international business operations and global economic conditions. the company enters into certain derivative financial instruments to lock in certain interest rates, as well as to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of its functional currency, the u.s. dollar.
cash flow hedges of interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swap arrangements to manage or hedge its interest rate risk. notwithstanding the terms of the swaps, the company is ultimately obligated for all amounts due and payable under the revolving commitment and the term loan ("credit facility"). the company does not use such instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
on june 19, 2019, the company entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap for an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million in order to hedge a portion of the company's floating rate indebtedness under the credit facility. the company designated the swap as a cash flow hedge. the swap requires the company to pay a fixed rate of 1.94% per annum on the notional amount. the notional amounts as of december 31, 2020 and 2019 were $40.0 and
$80.0 million, respectively. the cash flows from the swap began june 30, 2019 and end on december 31, 2021. as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, had been recorded as accumulated losses in other comprehensive income ("aoci"). realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment are reclassified from aoci to interest expense during the period of the cash flows. during 2020, $0.7 million was recorded as additional interest expense from the swap. during 2019, $0.1 million was recorded as interest income, partially offsetting the floating rate interest expense on our credit facility. on a quarterly basis, management evaluates any swap agreement to determine its effectiveness or ineffectiveness and records the change in fair value as an adjustment to aoci. management intends that the swap remains effective. no swaps existed at december 31,
2018.
52
hedges of foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency, the us dollar. we use foreign currency derivatives, specifically foreign currency forward contracts ("fx forwards"), to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the usd-cad and aud-usd exchange rates. fx forwards involve fixing the foreign currency exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. the fx forwards are typically settled in us dollars for their fair value at or close to their settlement date. we do not currently designate any of these fx forwards under hedge accounting, but rather reflect the changes in fair value immediately in earnings. we do not use such instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but rather use them to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates. changes in the fair value of fx forwards are recorded in other income/expense and were equal to a net gain of $0.2 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020 and a net loss of $0.4 million in 2019. the fair values of the company's fx forwards were recorded in other current liabilities as net obligations of $0.4 million and $0.2 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
as of december 31, 2020, the company had the following outstanding fx forwards(in thousands except for number of instruments):

during 2018, the company completed the analysis of earnings and profits of foreign investments. this resulted in the recognition at year ended december 31, 2018 of an additional $1.2 million related to the imposition of a tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the company has elected to include the global intangible low-
taxed income (gilti) as part of tax expense in the year incurred.
the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 26.5%on income before income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2020. the effective rate differs from the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes, adjustments related to the accelerated stock vesting expense and certain other disallowed deductions.
for 2019 the effective tax rate was 22.1%. the effective rate differs from the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes and beneficial adjustments related to the pension settlement.
for 2018 the effective tax rate was 25.4%. the effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes, tax benefits associated with restricted stock and adjustments due to the tcja.
during 2020, 2019 and 2018, the company paid income taxes of $81.2 million, $75.8 million and $77.3 million, respectively, net of refunds.
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes. significant components of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilitiesat december 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:

as of december 31, 2020, the company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately $ 58.5million, which will be available to offset future taxable income. if not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2021 and 2032. management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $ 0.7million of foreign net operating losses before they expire and has included a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. the valuation allowance increased by $
0.06million due to foreign net operating losses. the company has a foreign tax credit carryforward of $ 3.8million which if not fully utilized will expire in 2026.

earnings from continuing operations before income tax included foreign income of $ 25.3million in 2020, $
26.7million in 2019 and $ 22.7million in 2018. the company's international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisition of unrelated companies. repatriation of cash from the company's foreign subsidiaries is not part of the company's current business plan.
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2020 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $0.8 million.

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. in addition, the company has subsidiaries in various state and international jurisdictions that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2013 through 2019. with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to u.s. federal, state and local, or non-u.s., income tax examinations for years prior to 2013.
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next 12 months.
the company's policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
accrued interest and penalties were $ 0.07million and $ 0.03million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
during 2020 the company recognized interest and penalties of $ 0.1million.
13. accrual for termite contracts in accordance with the fasb asc topic 450 "contingencies,"the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.

year the accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities, $1.9 million and $2.3 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and long-term accrued liabilities, $0.9 million and $0.8 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
14. leases the company leases certain buildings, vehicles, and equipment in order to reduce the risk associated with ownership. the company elected the practical expedient approach permitted under asc 842 not to include short-term leases with a duration of 12 months or less on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, all leases were classified as operating leases. building leases generally carry terms of 5 to 10 years with annual rent escalations at fixed amounts per the lease. vehicle leases generally carry a fixed term of one year with renewal options to extend the lease on a monthly basis resulting in lease terms up to 7 years depending on the class of vehicle. the exercise of renewal options is at the company's sole discretion. it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise the renewal options on its vehicle leases. the measurement of right-of-use assets and liabilities for vehicle leases includes the fixed payments associated with such renewal periods. we separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. our lease agreements do not contain any material variable payments, residual value guarantees, early termination penalties or restrictive covenants.
55
the company uses the rate implicit in the lease when available; however, most of our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. accordingly, we estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at lease commencement.

as previously disclosed, the sec is conducting an investigation, which the company believes is primarily focused on how it established accruals and reserves at period-ends and the impact of those accruals and reserves on reported earnings. the investigation relates to period-ends for periods beginning january 1, 2015. the company is fully cooperating with the sec's investigation. the company cannot predict the outcome of this investigation. the company's audit committee retained independent counsel to conduct an internal investigation into matters related to the sec investigation and, in particular, the company's processes for establishing reserves for each quarter in the relevant periods. the internal investigation was concluded in october 2020. the company, after consultation with the audit committee and the independent counsel, believes that its financial statements filed with the sec on forms
10-k and 10-q for the relevant periods fairly present in all material respects its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of their respective balance sheet dates and for the periods then ended.
management does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.
16. employee benefit plans defined benefit pension plans rollins, inc. retirement income plan, (the "rollins, inc. plan")
the company has sponsored several noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans covering employees meeting certain age and service requirements, the most significant of which was the rollins, inc. plan. the plan provided benefits based on the average compensation for the highest five years during the last ten years of credited service (as defined) in which compensation was received, and the average anticipated social security covered earnings. the company funds its plans with at least the minimum amount required by erisa. the company made no contributions to the plans for the years ended december 31, 2020 or 2018, but contributed $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019.
in 2005, the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins, inc. plan, although the company remained obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005. in september 2019, the company settled this fully-funded pension plan through a combination of lump sum payments to participants, payments to the pension benefit guaranty corporation, and the purchase of a group annuity contract. with the completed funding of the plan payout settlements, the company had approximately $31.8 million of pension assets remaining. the remaining assets were the result of the funded status of the rollins, inc. plan, higher take rate of lump sum payment election by participants and optimal pricing of the group annuity contract. the company evaluated the erisa allowable opportunities for utilization of the excess pension assets, including funding other employee benefits. the company used $18.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2020 and $11.0 million during the year ended december 31,
2019 of the $31.8 million to fund its 401(k) match obligation. the company anticipates a possible reversion of any remaining pension assets to the company per erisa regulations in 2021. as of december 31, 2020, the company had approximately $1.2 million remaining of benefit plan assets related to the rollins, inc. plan.
the company continues to sponsor the waltham services, llc hourly employee pension plan ("waltham plan"), which covers less than 85 participants as of december 31, 2020. the waltham plan was amended, effective september 1,
2018, to freeze future benefit accruals for all participants. the company accounts for all defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 "compensation retirement benefits," and engages an outside actuary to calculate obligations and costs. with the assistance of the actuary, the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis, including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.

the accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans were $3.0 million and $2.8 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially the same for the waltham plan. in 2020 and 2018, pension liability pre-tax increases of $ 0.2million and
$ 14.8million, respectively, were credited, net of tax, to other comprehensive income. in 2019, the pre-tax decrease of $ 75.4million in the pension liability was charged, net of tax against other comprehensive income.
the following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the accumulated benefit obligation and net benefit cost:

in 2018, the company used a termination liability approach in calculating the 2018 discount rate for the rollins, inc. plan. the following assumptions were used 1) 3.90%, based on current market conditions, for participants in pay status expected to elect a plan termination annuity;
*  2) 4.11%, based on current market conditions, for active and terminated participants with deferred benefits expected to elect a plan termination annuity; 3) the irc 417(e) interest rates for the month of november 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88%), based on plan provisions, for all lump sum eligible expected to elect a plan termination lump sum. the waltham plan applied a 4.05% discount rate based on yield curve analysis.
the return on plan assets reflects the weighted average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in the plan. the expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company utilized a yield curve analysis for the waltham plan for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. for the rollins, inc. plan, the company utilized a termination liability approach for fiscal year 2018 and settled the plan in 2019.

for each of the asset categories in the waltham plan, the investment strategy is identical - maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. the investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. the plans utilize a number of investment approaches, including individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. the company and management are not considering making contributions to the remaining pension plan during fiscal 2021.
some of our assets, primarily our private equity ,real estate, and hedge funds, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. for the december 31, 2020 and 2019 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. for assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager statements combined with discussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.additionally, these investments are categorized as nav investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. in accordance with asu no. 2011-12 "investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent)," these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness. as of december 31, 2020, the company did not have any remaining benefit plan assets without readily determinable values .
fair value measurements given the plans to utilize the excess benefit plan assets from the settlement of the rollins, inc. plan, to fund its 401(k) matching contribution obligations, the company began liquidating investments in real estate funds and private equity funds after settlement. for the remaining waltham plan investments, the company has modified the overall investment strategy to mitigate risk related to volatility with asset types by transitioning to a higher percentage of fixed income securities. as such, the company's overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets to match long-term pension obligations and near-term benefits payments, with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. with the modification of investment strategy, the company has transitioned the majority of its assets to fixed-income securities. fixed-income securities include corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds, and u.s. treasuries. equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies domiciled domestically and internationally. for each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical - maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. the investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. the plans utilize a number of investment approaches, including but not limited to individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation.

the plan is available to non-full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one yearof service upon completion of 1,000 hoursin that year. the plan provides for a matching contribution of one dollar ($1.00) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions to the plan that do not exceed 3 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which include commissions, overtime, and bonuses) and fiftycents ($0.50) for each onedollar
($1.00) of a participant's contributions to the plan over the initial 3 percent that do not exceed 6percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). the charge to expense for the company match was approximately $ 27.4million and $ 25.5million for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 21.1million for the year ended december 31, 2018. at december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018
approximately, 34.9%, 30.8%, and 41.7%, respectively, of the plan assets consisted of rollins, inc. common stock.
total administrative fees paid by the company for the plan were less than $ 0.1million for each of the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
nonqualified deferred compensation plan the deferred compensation plan provides that participants may defer up to 50%of their base salary and up to 85%of their annual bonus with respect to any given plan year, subject to a $ 2thousand per plan year minimum. the company may make discretionary contributions to participant accounts but has not done so since 2011.
accounts will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain "measurement funds." account values are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and company credits had been converted into shares or other ownership units of selected measurement funds by purchasing
(or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the current purchase price of the relevant measurement fund at the time of the participant's selection. deferred compensation plan benefits are unsecured general obligations of the company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with the company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. the company has established a "rabbi trust," which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to indirectly fund any obligations under the deferred compensation plan. to the extent that the company's obligations under the deferred compensation plan exceed assets available under the trust, the company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability under the deferred compensation plan.
generally, the deferred compensation plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant's death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment (a "termination event").
however, for any deferrals of salary and bonus (but not company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is prior to a termination event. generally, the deferred compensation plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions under the deferred compensation plan in installments or lump-sum payments.
at december 31, 2020, the deferred compensation plan had 75life insurance policies with a net face value of $
50.2million compared to 71policies with a face value of $ 47.4million at december 31, 2019. the cash surrender value of these life insurance policies was worth $ 24.5million and $ 22.2million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

17. stock-based compensation stock compensation plans time lapse restricted shares and restricted stock units time lapse restricted shares (tlrss) have been issued to officers and other employees under the company's employee stock incentive plan. the company recognizes compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding over the remainder of the service period. the compensation cost recorded for these awards is based on their closing stock price at the grant date less the cost of estimated forfeitures. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures.
tlrss provide for the issuance of a share of the company's common stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. tlrss vest in
20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six yearsfrom the date of grant.
during these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. the agreements under which the one-time grant of restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.
in april 2018, the company granted a one-time issuance of tlrss on a tiered company tenure basis to u.s. based employees. the one-time grant vested 100 percent on the first anniversary date of the granted shares. the total shares granted were less than 0.1 million shares.
all share and per share information has been adjusted for the three-for-two stock split effective december 10,
2020.

the company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. at december 31, 2020, approximately
7.3million shares of the company's common stock were reserved for issuance. in accordance with the fasb asc topic
718, " compensation - stock compensation,"the company recognizes the fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the service periods of each award. the company estimates restricted share employee forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.

2020 marked the company's 23rd consecutive year of increased revenues. revenues for the year rose 7.2 percent to $2.161 billion compared to $2.015 billion for the prior year. income before income taxes increased 35.8% to $354.7 million compared to $261.2 million the prior year. net income increased 28.3% to $260.8 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.53 compared to $203.3 million, or $0.41 per diluted share for the prior year. the drop in net income from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributed to the pension settlement loss recorded in 2019.
covid-19 pandemic impact as the pandemic challenges grew early in 2020, the company made numerous operational adjustments to address the economic, health and safety challenges from the covid-19 pandemic. these included new covid-related procedures, modified customer service and related protocols, daily health screenings before entering shared offices, and a transition to remote work locations to reduce concentrations of personnel in offices where appropriate. cost containment efforts included furloughs, layoffs, elimination of non-essential travel, postponing capital expenditures, and temporary salary reductions for upper management, among other actions.
customer retention during the pandemic is less predictable, and of greater immediate concern compared with our normal operations, however, our residential pest and termite control business has remained reasonably consistent with some growth over prior years. with many sheltering or working from home, we have experienced higher than normal demand for our residential services. our commercial pest control business has been more adversely impacted, as it crosses multiple industries such as healthcare, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail and hospitality. each of these industries is being impacted differently by the pandemic. many of our commercial customers continue to operate as "essential" businesses; however, unfortunately there are a notable number of others that have closed, at least temporarily. we expect this impact will persist through much of 2021 until the majority of the population has been vaccinated against the virus. the company's residential and termite revenues grew 13.4% and 9.6%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019 while our commercial pest control revenues fell by 0.5%.

while we have a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet, based on our revenue growth this year, we do not anticipate any significant long-term loss in revenues or cash flows that would approach a level for impairment of intangible assets.
all of our critical supply-chain vendors have remained operational, and we have engaged additional new sources to supplement our existing suppliers, especially for critical ppe and other covid-19 related items. fleet suppliers and support vendors continue to serve our needs.
results of operations-2020 versus 2019
overview the company's revenues increased to $2.161 billion in 2020, a 7.2% increase compared to 2019. gross margin increased to 51.5% for 2020 from 50.7% in 2019. sales, general and administrative expense were 30.4% of revenues in 2020 compared to 30.9% in 2019. the company's depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of revenue increased 2.5% to 4.1% in 2020 compared to 4.0% in 2019. rollins' net income of $260.8 million in 2020 was an increase of $57.5 million, or 28.3%, compared to $203.3 million in 2019. net profit margin improved to 12.1% in 2020 from 10.1% in 2019. rollins continued to expand our global brand recognition with acquisitions in the united states, canada, united kingdom, australia, and asia as well as expanded our orkin international franchise program in numerous countries around the globe. the company continues to seek new international opportunities.
revenues revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 were $2.161 billion, an increase of $145.7 million, or 7.2%, from 2019 revenues of $2.015 billion. growth accounted for approximately 3.8% of our increase, and our acquisitions contributed the remaining revenue growth. we experienced strong growth in residential pest control, increasing 13.4%, while termite and ancillary revenues grew 9.6%. year over year commercial revenues were down 0.5% as commercial pest control was negatively impacted by the covid-19 virus due to various levels of government-driven shutdowns. the company's revenue mix for the year ended december 31, 2020 consisted primarily of 45% residential pest control, 36% commercial pest control and 19% termite and ancillary revenues (such as moisture control, insulation, deck and gutter work).
during 2020, the company chose to forgo the normal mid-year price increase, which historically contributes approximately 1.0% to our annual revenue growth. approximately 80% of the company's pest control revenue was recurring in 2020, as well as in 2019.
the company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% and 8% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the company established new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2020 while closing or acquiring others, for a total of 94 orkin international franchises and nine australia franchises at december 31, 2020, compared to 97 orkin international franchises, one canadian critter control franchises and ten australia franchises at december 31, 2019. the australia franchises operate under the murray pest control and scientific pest management names.
revenue from franchising was up 5.6% in 2020 compared to 2019 as the company continued to expand orkin's international footprint and recognition of initial franchise fees. international and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the company's revenues for 2020. orkin had 143 and 147 franchises (domestic and international) at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the company continued its strategy of buying back critter control franchises during 2020, resulting in a drop in franchises to 79 at december 31, 2020, compared to 85 at december 31, 2019.
cost of services provided for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, cost of services provided increased $55.0 million, or 5.5%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2019. gross margin for the year increased to 51.5% for 2020 from 50.7% in 2019. margin improvements were driven primarily from lower service wage growth compared to revenue growth, and from fleet savings driven by improvements in our routing and scheduling efficiencies and lower fuel prices.
19

depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, depreciation and amortization increased $7.2 million, or 8.9%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2019. the dollar increase was primarily due to depreciation increasing $4.0 million, or 10.9%, from the depreciation of acquired and purchased assets and depreciation from various it related projects. amortization of intangible assets increased $3.2 million, or 7.3%, for 2020 due to the additional amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions over the last year, including a full year of amortization for clark pest control acquired in april 2019, as well as several smaller foreign and domestic companies.
sales, general and administrative for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, sales, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $32.8 million, or 5.3%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2019. sg&a decreased to 30.4% of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to 30.9% in 2019. the company eliminated any non-essential spending at the start of the pandemic which lowered expenses in several areas. travel restrictions reduced typical training, site visits and conference costs. conversely, we incurred higher than normal expenses in 2019 related to acquisition preparation and integration activities for clark pest control.
gain / loss on sales of assets, net the company recorded a $1.6 million net loss on sales of assets for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to a net gain on sales of assets of $0.6 million in 2019. the company's 2020 losses came primarily from liquidating the pension plan assets from the 2019 pension plan settlement. during 2019, the company recorded gains from the sale of owned vehicles and other owned property.
interest expense, net interest expense, net for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 was $5.1 million and $6.9 million respectively, driven largely by borrowings to fund acquisitions, among other things.
taxes the company's effective tax rate increased to 26.5% in 2020 compared to 22.1% in 2019, due primarily to state and foreign income tax changes and limited tax deductibility for the accelerated stock vesting expense recognized in 2020. the 2019 rate was lower due to beneficial adjustments related to the 2019 pension settlement.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow cash from operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses.
the most significant source of cash in rollins' cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from services sold. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.

critical accounting policies and estimates the company views critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:
22

accrual for termite contracts-the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company's business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post incident drug testing, increased driver training and post-injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the   accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.
revenue recognition- the company's revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for refunds and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
more on the company's revenue recognition policy can be found in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies with the heading revenue recognition.
contingency accruals-the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 450 "contingencies," management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations. contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
recent accounting guidance see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.

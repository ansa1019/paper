item 1a.    risk factors business and operational risks commodity prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business.
our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the natural gas that we sell. lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically. historically, commodity prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas, changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results. any substantial or extended decline in future commodity prices would have, a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments. furthermore, substantial, extended decreases in commodity prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic, which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets, increase our costs under our revolving credit facility, and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans. refer to "future commodity price declines may result in write-downs of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations."
wide fluctuations in commodity prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. these factors include but are not limited to the following:
•the levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand, including the potential long-term impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale (such as that produced from our marcellus shale properties) on the global natural gas supply;
•the level of consumer demand for natural gas and oil, which has been significantly impacted by the covid-19 pandemic;
•weather conditions and seasonal trends;
•political, economic or health conditions in natural gas and oil producing regions, including the middle east, africa, south america and the united states, including for example, the impacts of local or international pandemics and disasters or events such as the global covid-19 pandemic;
•the ability and willingness of the members of opec+ to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;
•the price level and quantities of foreign imports;
•actions of governmental authorities;
•the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, transportation, processing and/or refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for natural gas and oil;
•inventory storage levels and the cost and availability of storage and transportation of natural gas and oil;
•the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental and climate change regulation;
•the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels;
•technological advances affecting energy consumption;
•speculation by investors in oil and natural gas;
•variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices; and
•overall economic conditions, including the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other major currencies.
these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict the future commodity prices. if commodity prices remain low or continue to decline significantly for a sustained period of time, the lower prices may cause us to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures, raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations.
drilling natural gas and oil wells is a high-risk activity.
our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program. drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. the cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including:
•decreases in commodity prices;
•unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations;
•equipment failures or accidents;
•adverse weather conditions;
•surface access restrictions;
•loss of title or other title related issues;
•lack of available gathering or processing facilities or delays in the construction thereof;
•compliance with, or changes in, governmental requirements and regulation, including with respect to wastewater disposal, discharge of greenhouse gases and fracturing; and
•costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials.
our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline. we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame, or at all. we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because, in some cases, we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location. similarly, our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including:
•the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of seismic data;
•the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects;
•the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled;
•economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews;
•our financial resources and results; and
•the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits.
these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells, if drilled, may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil.
our proved reserves are estimates. any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. the process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as commodity prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data.
results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.
as of december 31, 2020, approximately 37 percent of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. these reserve estimates reflect our plans to make capital expenditures for estimated future development costs of $1.4 billion to convert our pud reserves into proved developed reserves. the estimated future development costs associated with our pud reserves may not equal our actual costs, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. if we choose not to develop our pud reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves. in addition, under the sec's reserve reporting rules, because pud reserves generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any pud reserves that are not developed within this five-year time frame.
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves. in accordance with sec requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month average index price for the respective commodity, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.
future commodity price declines may result in write-downs of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
the value of our oil and gas properties depends on commodity prices. declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs, changes in well performance, delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding write-down of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties. because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas, changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results.
we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a property's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future commodity prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices decline, there could be a significant revision in the future.
our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.
our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania. at december 31, 2020, substantially all of our proved developed reserves and equivalent production were attributable to our properties located in the marcellus shale. as a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, state and local political forces and governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, severe weather events, water shortages or other conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or ngls in the region.
our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable.
in general, the production rate of oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations. our future production is, therefore, highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration, development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs. low commodity prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically.
our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31, 2020 will decrease at a rate of 10 percent, 25 percent, 17 percent and 13 percent during 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline. because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves, we consider this pattern to be fairly typical.
exploration, development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in, among other things, dry holes, the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves.
strategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate.
our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business. in developing our business plan, we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well-development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, corporate items and other alternatives. we also considered our likely sources of capital. notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2021 plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. if we fail to identify optimal business strategies, or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected. moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2021 plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.
our ability to sell our natural gas production and/or the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing.
the sale of our natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities. we deliver our natural gas production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. third-party systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons. in addition, at current commodity prices, construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may be slower to build out. to the extent these services are unavailable, we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production. our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business.
for example, the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates. the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells, as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells, may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available. in such an event, this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.
successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs, production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities. these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. in addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. we do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise.
there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. we often assume certain liabilities, and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. at times, we acquire interests in properties on an "as is" basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties. in addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.
the integration of the businesses and properties we may acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention away from our existing operations.
the integration of the businesses and properties we may acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention and financial resources away from our existing operations. these difficulties include:
•the challenge of integrating the acquired businesses and properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business;
•the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business;
•potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties; and
•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations.
the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business. if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.
we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses.
our business involves a variety of operating risks, including:
•well site blowouts, cratering and explosions;
•equipment failures;
•pipe or cement failures and casing collapses, which can release natural gas, oil, drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids;
•uncontrolled flows of natural gas, oil or well fluids;
•pipeline ruptures;
•fires;
•formations with abnormal pressures;
•handling and disposal of materials, including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids;
•release of toxic gas;
•buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials;
•pollution and other environmental risks, including conditions caused by previous owners or operators of our properties; and
•natural disasters.
any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life, loss of hydrocarbons, significant damage to or destruction of property, environmental pollution, natural resource damages, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.
our utilization of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. the location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks.
we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed.
we maintain insurance against some, but not all, operating risks and losses. we do not carry business interruption insurance. in addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. as of december 31, 2020, non-operated wells represented approximately nine percent of our total owned gross wells, or less than one percent of our owned net wells. we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues. our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs.
competition in our industry is intense, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do, which could adversely affect our competitive position.
competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense. major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties, as well as for the capital, equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties. our competitive position is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline connection times, distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record. many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours. these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. in addition, these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry. these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation.
further, driven in part by reduced commodity prices related to the global covid-19 pandemic, certain of our competitors may engage in bankruptcy proceedings, debt refinancing transactions, management changes, or other strategic initiatives in an attempt to reduce operating costs to maintain a position in the market. this could result in such competitors emerging with stronger or healthier balance sheets and in turn an improved ability to compete with us in the future. we may also see corporate consolidations among our competitors, which could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the industry.
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.
our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. in addition, our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers and other professionals. competition for experienced geologists, engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense and can be exacerbated following a downturn in which talented professionals leave the industry. if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
risks related to our indebtedness and hedging activities we have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.
we make and expect to make substantial capital expenditures in connection with our development and production projects. we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longer-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources. future challenges in the global financial system, including the capital markets, may adversely affect our business and our financial condition. our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection. in addition, there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves, which, if successful, could limit our ability to access capital markets. future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues.
risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.1 billion of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. increases in our level of indebtedness may:
•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments, which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, returning free cash flow to shareholders and future business opportunities;
•limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making certain investments, and paying dividends;
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt service obligations;
•depending on the levels of our outstanding debt, limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes; and
•increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business or the economy, including declines in commodity prices.
in addition, the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on our leverage ratio. accordingly, increases in the amount of our indebtedness without corresponding increases in our consolidated ebitdax, or decreases in our ebitdax without a corresponding decrease in our indebtedness, may result in an increase in our interest expense.
our debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. if commodity prices deteriorate from current levels or continue for an extended period, it could lead to reduced revenues, cash flow and earnings, which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance. because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates, the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period. a prolonged period of lower commodity prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants, we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures, sell non-strategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements. in addition, we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness. we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies, and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all. for more information about our debt agreements, please read "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition - capital resources and liquidity."
the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced, which could limit us in the future.
the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently $3.2 billion, and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are $1.5 billion. the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of our revolving credit facility on april 1. in addition, either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties. our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower commodity prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason. in the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise, our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. in addition, we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets, including the market for senior unsecured notes, to meet our obligations, including any such debt repayment obligations.
we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas.
from time to time, when we believe that market conditions are favorable, we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas production. while there are many different types of derivatives available, we generally utilize collar, swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively.
the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor. the swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place. these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices. in addition, these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances, including when:
•there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production;
•production is less than expected; or
•a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations.
the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions. these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties. while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements, the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps, materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions and/or reduce the availability of new or existing swaps. if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd-frank act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.
we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future. please read "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives.
legal, regulatory and governmental risks negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.
negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, oil spills, greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines, may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.
we are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental and safety regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including drilling, permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations could subject us to fines, injunctions or both. these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities, and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs. in addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of property we purchase or lease. risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental and safety compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations. for example, we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas. failure to comply with applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action requirements and orders. furthermore, due to the outcome of the 2020 u.s. congressional and presidential elections, potential increased restrictions on oil and gas production activities may result, which could have a material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry as a whole. for example, in january 2021, the biden administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any similar agency promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration's policies. also in january 2021, the biden administration issued certain executive orders focused on addressing climate change, which, among other things, revoked the permit for the keystone xl oil pipeline and directed the secretary of the interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. it is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production, would result in substantial costs and liabilities.
oil and natural gas production operations, especially those using hydraulic fracturing, are substantially dependent on the availability of water. our ability to produce natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.
water is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling process. in particular, we use a significant amount of water in the hydraulic fracturing process. our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. for water sourcing, we first seek to use non-potable water supplies for our operational needs. in certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. water must then be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. an inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. the imposition of new environmental regulations, including as a result of potential regulatory and legislative changes due to the outcome of the 2020 u.s. congressional and presidential elections, could further restrict our ability to conduct operations such as hydraulic fracturing by restricting the disposal of waste such as produced water and drilling fluids. compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. for example, in april 2011, the pennsylvania department of environmental protection (the padep) called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19, 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padep's total dissolved solids regulations. in june 2016, the epa published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works. the regulations were developed under the epa's effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act. in response to these actions, operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal.
federal and state legislation, judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development and the use of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells. this technology involves the injection of fluids-usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives-as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore. most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well. hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where the epa is the permitting authority, including pennsylvania. as a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations. these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive. in addition, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids. if enacted, such legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal, state or local levels, and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment, including groundwater, soil or surface water. we voluntarily disclose on a well-by-well basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at www.fracfocus.org. under the new presidential administration, the federal government may propose measures to impose additional regulations on or to limit or prohibit hydraulic fracturing. the new administration has recently imposed such measures on federal lands. in addition, president biden has indicated support for a ban on hydraulic fracturing. in march 2015, the department of the interior's bureau of land management issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land; however, these rules were rescinded by rule in december 2017 but similar rules could be proposed in the future. in addition, some states in which we operate, such as pennsylvania, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
further, state and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity in recent years. similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. when caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. in march 2016, the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including oklahoma, kansas, texas, colorado, new mexico, and arkansas. in light of these concerns, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. we cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal, which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.
in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states in which we operate, such as pennsylvania, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. for example, new york issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in june 2015. in addition, pennsylvania's act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14, 2012 and amended the state's oil and gas act to, among other things, increase civil penalties and strengthen the padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits. although the pennsylvania supreme court struck down portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules, this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state. in addition, if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. for example, a pennsylvania state appellate court in 2018 appeared to refuse to apply the established common law rule of capture in a case concerning claims of trespass by hydraulic fracturing. the pennsylvania supreme court heard the appeal of this ruling and on january 22, 2020, in briggs v. southwestern energy production co., 224 a.3d 334 (pa. 2020), affirmed the rule of capture and remanded the case to the pennsylvania state appellate court for further proceedings. on december 8, 2020, the appellate court issued a non-precedential decision reversing its previous order vacating the trial court's summary judgment in favor of southwestern energy production co. (southwestern). the appellate court refuted the assumptions made by the pennsylvania supreme court concerning the appellate court's disregard of the established rule of capture and based its reversal on the failure of plaintiffs to "specifically allege that southwestern engaged in horizontal drilling that extended onto their property, or that southwestern propelled fracturing fluids and proppants across the property line," leaving open the possibility that hydraulic fracturing can constitute a physical invasion, and thereby a trespass. future developments in caselaw that expand the ability of adjacent property owners to prevail on trespass claims based on hydraulic fracturing could have a material impact on our operations.
we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations. our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations. moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. for example, in april 2011, padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19, 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padep's total dissolved solids regulations. in june 2016, the epa published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works. the regulations were developed under the epa's effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act. in response to these actions, operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal.
a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices. in january 2021, the biden administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration's policies. additionally, the epa conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. the epa released its final report in december 2016. it concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells. this study and other studies that may be undertaken by the epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act, the toxic substances control act, or other statutory and/or regulatory mechanisms.
some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements. two examples are the epa's source aggregation rule and the epa's new source performance standards and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants.
in june 2016, the epa published a final rule concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry, and, as a result, aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex, costly, and time-consuming air permitting. particularly with respect to obtaining pre-construction permits, the final aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in our operations.
on august 16, 2012, the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for the oil and natural gas sector, including nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and neshap to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. in june 2016, the epa published a final rule that updated and expanded the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. in june 2017, the epa proposed a two year stay of certain requirements contained in the june 2016 rule and, in november 2017, issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30-day comment period on the information provided. in march 2018, the epa published a final rule that amended two narrow provisions of the nsps, removing the requirement for completion of delayed repair during emergency or unscheduled vent blowdowns. a 2016 information collection request made to oil and natural gas facilities by the epa in connection with its intention at the time to regulate methane emissions from existing sources was withdrawn in march 2017. in september 2020, the epa published a final rule amending the 2012 and 2016 nsps for the oil and natural gas sector that removed transmission and storage sources from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane requirements applicable to the production and processing sources. the same day as the publication of the september 2020 rule, 20 states and three municipalities filed a petition for review of the epa's final rule in the d.c. circuit court of appeals. in october 2020, the d.c. circuit court of appeals denied emergency motions for a stay of the oil and natural gas sector nsps amendments from taking effect pending review. the original petitioners have been joined by a number of environmental groups in challenging the september 2020 rule. in the event the petitioners are successful and the september 2020 amendments to the 2012 and 2016 nsps for the oil and gas sector are struck down or if the new administration otherwise amends the epa's regulations to impose regulations on methane or other additional regulatory requirements, compliance with these potential requirements, particularly a new methane regulation, may require modifications to certain of our operations or increase the cost of new or modified facilities, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and adversely impact our business.
climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.
scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as "greenhouse gases" (ghgs), including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. in response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of ghg emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, has and continues to attract political and social attention. the regulatory response to and physical effects of climate change have the potential to negatively affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services, reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks.
legislation to regulate ghg emissions has periodically been introduced in the u.s. congress and such legislation may be proposed or adopted in the future. in addition, the epa has adopted regulations addressing ghg emissions, including rules requiring the monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping of ghg emissions from specified sources in the united states that cover onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of co2e per year. since 2012, we have been required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under these rules and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline. in 2015, the epa finalized rules adding additional sources to the scope of the ghg monitoring and reporting requirements, including gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells, and adding well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. the epa published a final rule in 2016 adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report ghg emissions resulting from equipment leaks. in addition to the ghg monitoring and reporting rules, the epa adopted rules requiring permits for ghgs for certain large stationary sources beginning in 2011. however, in 2014, the u.s. supreme court, in utility air regulatory group v. epa, limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants.
there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions. the united states was actively involved in the negotiations at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris (unfccc), which led to the creation of the paris agreement. the paris agreement requires countries to review and "represent a progression" in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. the united states was a signatory to the paris agreement, which entered into full force in november 2016. former president trump announced the united states' plan to withdraw from the paris agreement in june 2017. this withdrawal formally took effect november 4, 2020. however, newly-elected president biden has sought immediate reentry of the united states into the paris agreement upon his inauguration. the terms and timeline under which the united states may reenter the paris agreement, or a separately negotiated agreement, are unclear at this time.
it is not possible at this time to predict the timing and effect of climate change or to predict the effect of the paris agreement or whether additional ghg legislation, regulations or other measures will be adopted at the federal, state or local levels. however, more aggressive efforts by governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce ghg emissions appear likely and any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. for example, several u.s. states and cities have committed to advance the objectives of the paris agreement at the state or local level despite the pending federal withdrawal. in addition, in january 2021, the biden administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any similar agency promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration's policies, including with respect to climate change. also in january 2021, the biden administration issued certain executive orders focused on addressing climate change, which, among other things, revoked the permit for the keystone xl oil pipeline and directed the secretary of the interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. further, actions of the biden administration may negatively impact oil and gas operations and favor renewable energy projects in the u.s., which may negatively impact the demand for natural gas or increase our operating costs.
the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any ghg emissions program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy.
beyond financial and regulatory impacts, climate change poses potential physical risks. scientific studies forecast that these risks include an increase in sea level, stresses on water supply and changes in weather conditions, such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. the projected physical effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect, delay and result in increased costs related to our operations. in addition, warmer winters as a result of global warming could also decrease demand for natural gas. however, because the nature and timing of changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration, and severity) are uncertain, any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change would be unreliable.
we are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws, rules and directives (collectively, data protection laws) relating to the processing of personal data.
the regulatory environment surrounding data protection laws is uncertain. complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and violations of applicable data protection laws can result in significant penalties. a determination that there have been violations of applicable data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could materially harm our business and reputation.
any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. as noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws. additionally, the acquisition of a company that is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws may result in a violation of these laws.
tax law changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that, if adopted, would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by u.s. oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes. the proposals include: repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. the biden administration has also previously provided informal guidance on certain tax law changes that it would support, which includes, among other things, raising tax rates on both domestic and foreign income and imposing a new alternative minimum tax on book income. further, many states are currently in deficits, and have been enacting laws eliminating or limiting certain deductions, carryforwards, and credits in order to increase tax revenue.
should the u.s. or the states pass tax legislation limiting any currently allowed tax incentives and deductions, our taxes would increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. this could also reduce our drilling activities in the u.s. since future changes to federal and state tax legislation and regulations are unknown, we cannot know the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business.
risks related to business disruption business disruptions from unexpected events, including pandemics, health crises and natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.
the occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including a public health crisis, pandemic and epidemic, war or civil unrest, a terrorist act, including a cybersecurity threat to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and to render data or systems unusable, a weather event, an earthquake or other catastrophe could cause instability in world financial markets and lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. for example, the ongoing covid-19 outbreak has resulted in widespread adverse impacts on the global economy, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus and alleviate strain on the healthcare system, such as quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns (whether through a continuation of existing measures or the re-imposition of prior measures). we have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk to our employees, our business and the communities in which we operate, and we are actively assessing and planning for various operational contingencies in the event one or more of our operational employees experiences any symptoms consistent with covid-19. however, if a significant portion of our employees or contractors were unable to work due to illness or if our field operations were suspended or temporarily restricted due to control measures designed to contain the outbreak, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we cannot guarantee that any precautionary actions taken by us will be effective in preventing disruptions to our business.
we regularly monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and derivative contract counterparties. although we have not received notices from our customers or counterparties regarding non-performance issues or delays resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, to the extent we or any of our material suppliers or customers are unable to operate due to government restrictions or otherwise, we may have to temporarily shut down or reduce production, which could result in significant downtime and have significant adverse consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, most of our non-operational employees are now working remotely, which could increase the risk of security breaches or other cyber-incidents or attacks, loss of data, fraud and other disruptions.
furthermore, the impact of the pandemic, including a resulting reduction in demand for oil and natural gas, coupled with the sharp decline in commodity prices following the announcement of price reductions and production increases in march 2020 by members of opec+ has led to significant global economic contraction generally and in our industry in particular. while an agreement to cut production has since been announced by opec+ and its allies, the situation, coupled with the impact of covid-19 and storage and transportation capacity constraints, has continued to result in a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry. we cannot predict the full impact that covid-19 or the significant disruption and volatility currently being experienced in the oil and natural gas markets will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations at this time due to numerous uncertainties. for example, although the negative effects on crude oil pricing have been more significant than effects on natural gas to date, the operations of our midstream service providers, on whom we rely for the transmission, gathering and processing of a significant portion of our produced natural gas may be disrupted or suspended in response to containing the outbreak, and/or the economic challenges may lead to a reduction in capacity or closing of the facilities and infrastructure of our midstream service providers, which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our produced natural gas or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties. the ultimate impacts will depend on future developments, including, among others, the ultimate geographic spread and severity of the virus, any resurgence in covid-19 transmission and infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience an improvement, the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to mitigate the spread of the virus and alleviate strain on the healthcare system, the development of effective treatments, the duration of the outbreak, further actions taken by members of opec+, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability, and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume.
cyber-attacks targeting our systems, the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure, or the systems of our third-party service providers could adversely affect our business.
our business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data, computer networks and connected infrastructure, including technologies that are managed by third-party providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. we depend on this technology to record and store financial data, estimate quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves, analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally. computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the united states, which are necessary to transport our products to market, to enable communications and to provide a host of other support services for our business. in response to the covid-19 pandemic, most of our non-operational employees moved to a remote work model. this model has significantly increased the use of remote networking and online conferencing services that enable employees to work outside of our corporate infrastructure, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive information as a result of increased remote access and other cybersecurity related incidents.
cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, phishing, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information, customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. if our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, which may include drilling, completion, production and corporate functions. a cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production, non-compliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer's or supplier's data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.
in addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period, and our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against such cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. as cyber-attackers become more sophisticated, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyber-attacks. furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention, and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.
risks related to our corporate structure provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment.
our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock. in addition, delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties. our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders. because of these provisions of our charter, bylaws and delaware law, persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. as a result, these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors.
the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter.
the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors' duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law. specifically, our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:
•for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders;
•for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
•under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; and
•for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited our stockholders.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.
overview financial and operating overview financial and operating results for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019 are as follows:
•natural gas production decreased 7.6 bcf, or one percent, from 865.3 bcf in 2019 to 857.7 bcf in 2020. the slight decrease was driven by strategic curtailments of production during a portion of the second half of 2020 due to weaker natural gas prices.
•average realized natural gas price for 2020 was $1.68 per mcf, 31 percent lower than the $2.45 per mcf price realized in 2019.
•total capital expenditures were $569.8 million in 2020 compared to $783.3 million in 2019.
•drilled 74 gross wells (64.3 net) with a success rate of 100 percent in 2020 compared to 96 gross wells (94.0 net) with a success rate of 100 percent in 2019.
•completed 86 gross wells (77.3 net) in 2020 compared to 99 gross wells (97.0 net) in 2019.
•average rig count during 2020 was approximately 2.3 rigs in the marcellus shale, compared to an average rig count in the marcellus shale of approximately 3.1 rigs during 2019.
•repaid $87.0 million of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes, which matured in july 2020.
market conditions and commodity prices our financial results depend on many factors, particularly commodity prices and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials, weather conditions and other factors. our realized prices are also further impacted by our hedging activities.
our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices, particularly natural gas prices. since substantially all of our production and reserves are natural gas, significant declines in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and ability to obtain financing. lower natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically. in addition, in periods of low natural gas prices, we may elect to curtail a portion of our production from time to time. historically, natural gas prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. as a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program, production volumes or revenues. in addition to commodity prices and production volumes, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success.
we account for our derivative instruments on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. as a result of these mark-to-market adjustments associated with our derivative instruments, we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility. refer to "impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues" below and note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
the ongoing covid-19 outbreak, which the world health organization (who) declared as a pandemic on march 11, 2020, has reached more than 200 countries and territories and there continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid-19 will continue to spread, the development, availability and administration of effective treatments and vaccines and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus and alleviate strain on the healthcare system and the economic impact of such actions. one of the impacts of the covid-19
pandemic has been a significant reduction in demand for crude oil, and to a lesser extent, natural gas. the supply/demand imbalance driven by the covid-19 pandemic, as well as production disagreements among members of opec+, has led to significant global economic contraction generally and continues to have disruptive impacts on the oil and gas industry. while subsequent negotiations between members of opec+ led to an agreement to reduce production volumes in an effort to stabilize crude oil prices, crude oil prices remained at depressed levels throughout 2020 and continue to remain at depressed levels in 2021, as the oversupply and lack of demand in the market persist. natural gas prices remained low during 2020 compared to 2019, including during the second half of 2020, in part, due to lower seasonal demand during the shoulder season of 2020 and storage levels nearing capacity. in response to the weakness of natural gas prices, we strategically curtailed our production during the second half of 2020, resulting in an estimated curtailment of approximately 16.1 bcf of gross production.
meanwhile, nymex natural gas futures prices have shown improvements since the implementation of pandemic-related restrictions and opec+ price disagreements. the improvements in natural gas futures prices are based on market expectations that declines in future natural gas supplies due to a substantial reduction of associated gas related to the curtailment of operations in oil basins throughout the united states will more than offset the lower demand recently experienced with the covid-19 pandemic. while the current outlook on natural gas prices is favorable and our operations have not been significantly impacted in the short-term, in the event these disruptions continue for an extended period of time, our operations could be adversely impacted, commodity prices could continue to decline further and our costs may increase. while we are unable to predict future commodity prices, at current natural gas price levels, we do not believe that an impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future; however, in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels, management would evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties.
we have implemented preventative measures and developed response plans intended to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure and prevent infection among our employees and the communities in which we operate. we also have modified certain business practices (including those related to nonoperational employee work locations and the cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by the centers for disease control and prevention, the who and other governmental and regulatory authorities. in addition, we implemented and provided training on a covid-19 safety policy containing personal safety protocols; provided additional personal protective equipment to our workforce; implemented rigorous covid-19 self-assessment, contract tracing and quarantine protocols; increased cleaning protocols at all of our employee work locations; and provided additional paid leave to employees with actual or presumed covid-19 cases. we also collaborated, and continue to collaborate, with customers to minimize potential impacts to or disruptions of our operations and to implement longer-term emergency response protocols. we will continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce, our customers, our service providers and the communities in which we operate, including any resurgence in covid-19 transmission and infection, and take additional precautions as we believe are warranted.
our efforts to respond to the challenges presented by the on-going pandemic, as well as certain operational decisions we previously implemented such as our maintenance capital program, have helped to minimize the impact, and any resulting disruptions, of the pandemic to our business and operations. we have not required any funding under any federal or other governmental programs to support our operations, and we do not expect to have to utilize any such funding. as a result, we currently believe that we are well-positioned to manage the challenges presented in a lower commodity pricing environment and can endure the current cyclical downturn in the energy industry and continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by:
•continuing to exercise discipline in our capital program with the expectation of funding our capital expenditures with cash on hand, operating cash flows, and if required, borrowings under our revolving credit facility;
•continuing to manage our portfolio by strategically curtailing production in periods of weaker natural gas prices;
•continuing to optimize our drilling, completion and operational efficiencies, resulting in lower operating costs per unit of production;
•continuing to manage our balance sheet, which we believe provides sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility and existing cash balances to meet our capital requirements and maintain compliance with our debt covenants; and
•continuing to manage price risk by strategically hedging our production.
the impact that covid-19 will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, including, among others, the duration, ultimate geographic spread and severity of the virus, any resurgence in covid-19 transmission and infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience an improvement, the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to mitigate the spread of the virus and alleviate strain on the healthcare system, the development of effective treatments, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability, and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume.
for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our revenues, refer to "results of operations" below.
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in 2020 were from the sale of natural gas production, including the receipt of derivative cash settlements and certain income tax receivables related to alternative minimum tax credit refunds. these cash flows were used to fund our capital expenditures, principal and interest payments on debt and payment of dividends. see below for additional discussion and analysis of our cash flows.
the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april. in addition, either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties. effective april 23, 2020, the borrowing base and available commitments were reaffirmed at $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our unused commitments remained at $1.5 billion.
a decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under our revolving credit facility. unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels, we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations.
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity. our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. we believe that, with internally generated operating cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans.
at december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both our revolving credit facility and senior notes. refer to note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding restrictive covenants.
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities are as follows:
year ended december 31,
(in thousands)                                                                           2020   2019                            2018
cash flows provided by operating activities                                      $778,235                      $1,445,791                      $1,104,903
cash flows used in investing activities                                         (584,478)                       (543,915)                       (293,383)
cash flows used in financing activities                                         (255,849)                       (690,380)                     (1,289,280)
net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash           $(62,092)                        $211,496                      $(477,760)
operating activities. operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices, changes in our production volumes and operating expenses. commodity prices have historically been volatile, primarily as a result of supply and demand for natural gas, pipeline infrastructure constraints, basis differentials, inventory storage levels, seasonal influences, and other factors. in addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures.
our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility, repayments of debt, the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable, respectively, payment of dividends, repurchases of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity. from time to time, our working capital will reflect a deficit, while at other times it will reflect a surplus. this fluctuation is not unusual. at december 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a working capital surplus of $25.5 million and $240.2 million, respectively. we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 decreased by $667.6 million compared to 2019. this decrease was primarily due to lower natural gas revenue and lower derivative settlement gains. these decreases were partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities. the decrease in natural gas revenue was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas prices and marginally lower natural gas production. average realized natural gas prices decreased by 31 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. natural gas production decreased by one percent for 2020 compared to 2019, which was driven by strategic curtailments of production during a portion of the second half of 2020 due to weaker natural gas prices.
refer to "results of operations" for additional information relative to commodity price, production and operating expense fluctuations. we are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities.
investing activities. cash flows used in investing activities increased by $40.6 million from 2019 compared to 2020. the increase was due to lower proceeds of $258.8 million from sale of our investment in meade in november 2019 and constitution in january 2020, partially offset by $212.5 million of lower capital expenditures as a result of the implementation of our maintenance capital program in 2020 and $9.3 million of lower capital contributions associated with our equity method investments.
financing activities. cash flows used in financing activities decreased by $434.5 million from 2019 compared to 2020. the decrease was due to $519.9 million of lower repurchases of our common stock in 2020 compared to 2019 and $7.4 million of lower debt issuance costs associated with the amendment of our revolving credit facility in 2019. these decreases were partially offset by $80.0 million higher net repayments of debt primarily related to maturities of certain of our senior notes in 2020 and $13.9 million of higher dividend payments related to an increase in our dividend rate in 2019.
2019 and 2018 compared. for additional information on the comparison of operating, investing and financing cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, refer to financial condition (cash flows) included in the cabot oil & gas corporation annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.

(1)interest payments have been calculated utilizing the rates associated with our senior notes outstanding at december 31, 2020, assuming that our senior notes will remain outstanding through their respective maturity dates.
(2)for further information on our obligations under transportation and gathering agreements and operating leases, refer to note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table due to the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. the total amount of our asset retirement obligations at december 31, 2020 was $86.0 million. refer to note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
we have no off-balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations.
potential impact of our critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities. the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. actual results could differ from those estimates.
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred. exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed. development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves, are capitalized.
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserves data included in this document is only an estimate. the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as commodity prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time. periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance, drilling activity, commodity prices, fluctuations in operating expenses, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors. accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered. we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions.
our reserves estimate has been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents, independent petroleum engineers, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. for more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8.
our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit-of-production calculation. if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record dd&a expense would increase, reducing net income. such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields. a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of $0.02 per mcfe and an increase of $0.02 per mcfe, respectively, on our dd&a rate. this estimated impact is based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd&a rate.
in addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards. due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, we cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future.
oil and gas properties we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future commodity prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process, historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that we believe will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices significantly decline, we would test the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and, if necessary, record an impairment charge. fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil.
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives. average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. historically, the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years. the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling.
as these properties are developed and reserves are proved, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful and the properties are abandoned or surrendered, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity are expensed in the year the determination is made. the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program.
asset retirement obligations the majority of our asset retirement obligations (aro) relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells. we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rate. in periods subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method, while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time (accretion expense) are reflected as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
derivative instruments under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. at the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked-to-market. the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties or internal models. such quotes and models have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward commodity prices, basis differentials, volatility factors and interest rates for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term, as applicable. these estimates are derived from or verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for non-performance risk. we measure the non-performance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks.
our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of commodity prices, both nymex and basis differentials.
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken. we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties.
we believe all of our deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowances, will ultimately be realized, taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income, which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices. if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized.
our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates and/or changes in tax laws which could affect us. our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property, payroll and revenues among states in which we operate. a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings.
contingency reserves a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable. the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. in certain cases, our judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws, our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters, and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter. actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons, including those noted above. we monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have. future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued.
stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards. under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equity-classified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. to calculate fair value, we use a monte carlo valuation model, as determined by the specific provisions of the award. the use of this model requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors. stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.
other issues and contingencies regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. refer to the "other business matters" section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations.
restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. among other requirements, our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.75 to 1.0. our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. at december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement.
operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks. refer to "risk factors-business and operational risks-we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in item 1a. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience, the areas in which we operate and market conditions.
commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices. further declines in commodity prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. lower commodity prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically. historically, commodity prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. in particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants. because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas, changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results.
the majority of our production is sold at market prices. generally, if the related commodity index declines, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control. however, we may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of financial commodity derivatives, including collars and swaps to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue. under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions.
results of operations
2020 and 2019 compared we reported net income for 2020 of $200.5 million, or $0.50 per share, compared to net income for 2019 of $681.1 million, or $1.64 per share. the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating revenues and lower earnings on equity method investments, partially offset by lower operating and income tax expenses.

the decrease in natural gas revenues of $580.3 million was due to lower production and lower natural gas prices. the slight decrease in production was driven by strategic curtailments of production during a portion of the second half of 2020 due to weaker natural gas prices.

total costs and expenses from operations decreased by $19.0 million from 2019 to 2020. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•direct operations decreased $3.6 million primarily due to lower production and continued efficiencies in our operations in the marcellus shale offset by higher workover expenses during the period.
•transportation and gathering decreased $3.6 million due to lower throughput as a result of lower marcellus shale production, partially offset by higher demand charges.
•taxes other than income decreased $2.7 million due to $3.5 million lower drilling impact fees driven by a decrease in rates associated with lower natural gas prices and a decrease in drilling activity in 2020 compared to 2019, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in production tax refunds that were received in 2019.
•exploration decreased $4.9 million primarily due to a $3.5 million decrease in geological and geophysical expenses, $1.3 million decrease in employee costs and $0.9 million decrease in other exploration costs. these decreases were partially offset by higher exploratory dry hole costs of $1.4 million.
•depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $14.8 million primarily due to lower amortization of unproved properties of $24.4 million, partially offset by higher dd&a of $8.3 million. amortization of unproved properties decreased due to lower amortization rates as a result of a decrease in exploration activities. the increase in dd&a was primarily due to an increase of $11.5 million related to a higher dd&a rate of $0.43 per mcfe for 2020 compared to $0.42 per mcfe for 2019, partially offset by a decrease of $3.2 million due to lower natural gas production volumes in the marcellus shale.
•general and administrative increased $10.5 million primarily due to a $12.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense associated with certain of our market-based performance awards and a $5.0 million increase in legal expenses. these increases were partially offset by $2.5 million of lower severance costs that were incurred in the third quarter 2019 and a $5.0 million decrease in employee-related costs. the remaining changes in other general and administrative expense were not individually significant.
(loss) earnings on equity method investments earnings on equity method investments decreased $80.6 million primarily due to the sale of our investment in meade in the fourth quarter of 2019 for a gain of $75.8 million and constitution in february 2020 for a loss of $9.4 million that was previously accrued in 2019. there was no significant activity during 2020.
interest expense, net interest expense decreased $0.8 million primarily due to $2.7 million of lower interest expense related to the repayment of $87.0 million of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes, which matured in july 2020 and $3.5 million of interest income associated with certain income tax refunds received in the fourth quarter of 2020. these decreases were partially offset by a $3.1 million reversal of interest expense in 2019 related to certain income tax reserves previously recorded in prior periods.
income tax expense income tax expense decreased $178.6 million due to lower pretax income and a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 16.8 percent and 24.3 percent, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to research and development tax credit benefits recorded in 2020 related to amended prior year returns.
2019 and 2018 compared we reported net income for 2019 of $681.1 million, or $1.64 per share, compared to net income for 2018 of $557.0 million, or $1.25 per share. the increase in net income was primarily due to lower operating expenses and interest expense and higher earnings on equity method investments. these increases were partially offset by lower operating revenues and higher income tax expense.
for additional information on the comparison of the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, refer to management's discussion and analysis included in the cabot oil & gas corporation annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.
non-gaap financial measures explanation and reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures we report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (gaap). however, we believe certain non-gaap performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods. in addition, we believe these measures are used by analysts and others in the valuation, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. the reconciliations of gaap financial measures to non-gaap financial measures presented in this annual report on form 10-k are shown below.
reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income adjusted net income is presented based on our belief that this non-gaap measure enables a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. adjusted net income is defined as net income plus gain and loss on sale of assets, gain and loss on derivative instruments, gain on sale of equity method investments, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, interest expense related to income tax reserves and tax effect on selected items. additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods. adjusted net income is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as defined by gaap.

discretionary cash flow and free cash flow calculation and reconciliation discretionary cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in assets and liabilities. discretionary cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and service debt. discretionary cash flow is presented based on our belief that this non-gaap measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income, as defined by gaap, or as a measure of liquidity.
free cash flow is defined as discretionary cash flow (defined above) less capital expenditures and investment in equity method investments. free cash flow is an indicator of a company's ability to generate cash flow after spending the money required to maintain or expand its asset base. free cash flow is presented based on our belief that this non-gaap measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies. free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income, as defined by gaap, or as a measure of liquidity.

finding and development costs drill-bit finding and development cost is defined as costs incurred in exploration and development activities, as defined by gaap, divided by reserve extensions, discoveries and other additions. additions-only finding and development cost is defined as costs incurred in property acquisition, exploration and development activities, as defined by gaap, divided by reserve extensions, discoveries and other additions. all-sources finding and development cost is defined as costs incurred in property acquisition, exploration and development activities as defined by gaap divided by the total of reserve extensions, discoveries and other additions and revision of prior estimates. drill-bit finding and development cost, additions-only finding and development cost and all-sources finding and development cost are presented based on our belief that these non-gaap measures are useful information to investors to evaluate how much it costs to add proved reserves. these calculations do not include the future development costs required for the development of proved undeveloped reserves and may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies.

item 1a. risk factors risks related to economic and political conditions the extent to which the coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
the novel strain of the coronavirus identified in late 2019 has spread across the globe and has resulted in governmental and other regulatory authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus and its variants, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, as well as the work force, operations and financial prospects of our customers, suppliers and business partners. there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures, such as restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our customers, suppliers and business partners. the spread of covid-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, developing social distancing plans for our employees, expanding the number of our associates who work from home, and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and tradeshows), and we may take further actions as may be required by governmental and other regulatory authorities or as we determine are necessary to protect the safety or best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and business partners.
impacts our businesses are experiencing from covid-19 include, but are not limited to:
•the ability of our businesses to visit current and potential customers in order to solicit new business and/or provide necessary on-site installation, implementation and training services has been impacted by the pandemic, which has, in some cases, limited our ability to obtain new business and effectively service existing business;
•government restrictions on non-emergency hospital procedures resulted in decreased (1) demand in our businesses that provide medical products used in non-emergency procedures and (2) revenue related to pharmaceutical utilization in post-acute healthcare settings;
•the unprecedented slowdown and/or shut down of global economy sectors and the related uncertain timeline to reopen and recover, particularly in areas experiencing a more severe outbreak of the virus, has created a weak demand environment for our businesses serving industrial and energy markets; and
•some of our customers, including those in the medical field, may seek to delay payments to us while they are addressing the numerous challenges presented by covid-19; to date, such delays have not impacted the timing of our cash flow in a significant manner.
the extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus including distribution and administration of available vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. after the covid-19 outbreak subsides, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus's global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.
there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of covid-19 and its variants as a global pandemic may have on our customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. in addition, the rapidly changing situation could give rise to additional risks or adverse impacts of which we are not presently aware, such as the ability to complete acquisitions, the ability to obtain credit through the capital markets and/or through our revolving credit facility. we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economic and political environment as a whole. however, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described below in this "risk factors" section.
economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, 19% of our net revenues and 15% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the u.s. we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the u.s. including, without limitation, the following:
•adverse changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;
•oil price volatility;
•trade protection measures, tariffs, and import or export requirements;
•subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations;
•partial or total expropriation;
•potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;
•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;
•differing labor regulations;
•differing protection of intellectual property;
•differing and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and
•potentially negative consequences from the united kingdom's exit from the european union.
risks related to our business operations our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.
as of december 31, 2020, we had $9,566.5 in total consolidated indebtedness. in addition, we had $1,351.0 undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility. subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions.
our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. for example, our indebtedness could:
•limit our ability to borrow additional funds;
•limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;
•limit our ability to pay dividends;
•limit our ability to make capital expenditures;
•place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; and
•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.
our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness.
unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business.
several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar represented 16% of our total net revenues for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019. unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings.
our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
many of our products and services rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.
our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully.
our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. there are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues, profitability or cash flows.
acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results.
our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacture and distribution of our products. in addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. we currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses. we also maintain other insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. however, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.
our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers.
in some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows. additionally, many of our customers are government entities. in many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency.
we face intense competition. if we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.
we face intense competition from numerous competitors in our various businesses. our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities. we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. in addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner. we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive.
some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy.
some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. accordingly, a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on material portions of our business.
our goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets, and any write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.
our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2020, goodwill totaled $14,395.2 compared to $10,479.8 of stockholders' equity, and represented 60% of our total assets of $24,024.8. the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating income. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations, the effect of which could be material.
we depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business.
the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile. this product development may require substantial internal investment. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations.
our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors. a shutdown of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. computer viruses, cyber-attacks, other external hazards and/or human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. for example, vertafore determined that as a result of human error, three data files containing texas driver's license data were inadvertently stored in an unsecured external storage service that appears to have been accessed without authorization. as a result, vertafore has been named as a defendant in a number of putative class actions regarding the incident.
global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the company, its businesses, its customers and/or its third-party service providers, including, but not limited to, cloud providers and providers of network management services. these may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers, including incidents similar to the "trojan horse" attack commonly referred to as the solarwinds security breach. moreover, as more of our employees work remotely due to the covid 19 pandemic or otherwise, our networks and systems may be more susceptible to breach or sabotage due to employee misuse or error which may increase the risk of access to our systems by unauthorized parties.
our customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and services, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. while we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the company. we seek to deploy measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. despite these efforts, we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address, or mitigate the negative effects of cyberattacks or other security compromises, and such cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, damage to our it systems, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines, diminution in the value of our investment in research and development, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.
changes in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business.
the availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
risks related to government regulations regulation of privacy and data security may adversely affect sales of our products and services and result in increased compliance costs.
there has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, increased regulation with respect to the collection, use and handling of personal, financial and other information as regulatory authorities in the united states and around the world have recently passed or are currently considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, privacy and data security. this includes the california consumer privacy act, or ccpa, which came into effect in january 2020, and the gdpr, which is a european union-wide legal framework to govern data collection, use and sharing and related consumer privacy rights that became effective in may 2018. the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. the gdpr provides significant penalties for non-compliance (up to 4% of global revenue). european data protection authorities have already imposed fines for gdpr violations up to, in some cases, hundreds of millions of euros. many states in the united states are also considering their own privacy laws that, in the absence of a preemptive federal privacy law, could impose burdensome and conflicting requirements. the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws and industry standards in the united states, europe and elsewhere can be uncertain and currently is in flux. cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, including data localization requirements and other restrictions concerning international transfer of data, the operational and cost impact of which cannot be fully known at this time. in addition to the possibility of fines, application of these existing laws in a manner inconsistent with our data and privacy practices could result in an order requiring that we change our data and privacy practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. also, any new law or regulation, or interpretation of existing law or regulation, imposing greater fees or taxes or restriction on the collection, use or transfer of information or data internationally or over the web, could result in a decline in the use and adversely affect sales of our products and services and our results of operations. finally, as we increasingly become a provider of technology solutions, our customers and regulators will expect that we can demonstrate compliance with current data privacy and security regulations as well as our privacy policies and the information we make available to our customers and the public about our data handling practices, and our inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our solutions and services to certain customers, particularly customers in highly-regulated industries, such as the healthcare industry, and could result in regulatory actions, fines, legal proceedings and negatively impact our brand, reputation and our business.
we export a significant portion of our products. difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business.
sales to customers outside the u.s. by our businesses located in the u.s. account for a significant portion of our net revenues. these sales accounted for 7% and 10% of our net revenues for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. such risks include, without limitation, the following:
•unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export requirements;
•restrictions on the export of technology and related products;
•unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries;
•unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and
•a general economic downturn in our foreign markets.
the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings.
general risk factors changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team, and the resulting management transitions, could harm our operating results.
over the past several years, we have experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team. leadership transitions and changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key leadership positions. if we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and changes, it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business.
any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, incidents of directed cyber attacks, public health crisis or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance.
if terrorist activity, armed conflict, directed cyber attacks, political instability, public health crisis, such as an epidemic or pandemic related to the covid-19, or natural disasters occur in the u.s. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services, or who purchase goods and services from us, will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress. notably, the global covid-19 pandemic has created heightened risk that third parties may be unable to perform their obligations or suffer financial distress due to the global economic impact of the pandemic and the regulatory measures that have been enacted by governments to contain the spread of the virus, however, we are unable predict the impact that covid-19 will have on any of our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions or their ability to perform their obligations. if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us, we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us. in such events, we may incur losses, or our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected.
legal proceedings in which we are, or may be, a party may adversely affect us.
we are currently, and may in the future, become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers, intellectual property matters, third party liability, including product liability claims, and employment claims. we are and may in the future become subject to litigation regarding data or privacy incidents, as more fully described above in "we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations".
a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs.
unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds. if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets may be impacted and the price we pay to issue debt could increase. additionally, our credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded. further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all currency amounts are in millions unless specified a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2020 year-over-year changes can be found below and a detailed discussion of fiscal 2019 year-over-year changes can be found in item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019.
overview we are a diversified technology company. we operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and saas) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets.
we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. our acquisitions have represented both new strategic platforms and additions to existing businesses.
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2020 included in this annual report.
gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.
the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec. although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. if an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment.
our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition, income taxes, valuation of other intangible assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment analyses. estimates are considered to be significant if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period.
accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given after the customer obtains control over the promised products or services, including in certain cases credits for returned products. allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, changes to customer creditworthiness and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions based on an analysis of historical credit memos and is treated as a reduction in revenue. at december 31, 2020, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $25.3 and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $3.8, for a total of $29.1, or 3.3% of total gross accounts receivable, as compared to a total of $20.3, or 2.5% of total gross accounts receivable, at december 31, 2019. this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible.
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. when we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. at december 31, 2020, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $40.4, or 16.9% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $33.4, or 14.4% of gross inventory cost, at december 31, 2019. the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost is influenced by specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory.
most of our product-based revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net revenues for each of the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
revenues from our project-based businesses, including toll and traffic systems, control systems and installations of large software application projects, are generally recognized over time using the input method, primarily utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs, as the measure of performance. the company recognized revenues of $345.0, $247.8 and $245.9 for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, using this method. there was $363.9 and $401.6 of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized at december 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. the decrease was due primarily to revenue recognized at our transcore business related to the contract for the new york central business district tolling program during 2020.
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the u.s., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. during 2020, our effective income tax rate was 21.5%, as compared to the 2019 rate of 20.6%. the increase was due primarily to the following non-recurring items in 2019, (i) recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $41.0 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses, and (ii) the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the excess of gatan's book basis over tax basis in the shares of $10.0 in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the imaging and gatan gains during 2019. we expect the effective tax rate for 2021 to be approximately 21% to 22%.
we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).
when testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.
we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. the quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology) to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, a non-cash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess.
key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the projected revenue growth rates, future operating margins, discount rates, terminal values and earnings multiples. while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.
recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.
roper has 36 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $3,228.7. in 2020, the company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. the company conducted its analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. the company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 35 of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units. for the remaining reporting unit, the company performed its quantitative assessment and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of october 1, 2020.
trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is less than its carrying amount. if necessary, we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. this methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the royalty rates, projected revenue growth rates, discount rates and terminal values. each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for future sales growth.
the company performed a quantitative analysis over the fair values of two of its trade names and concluded that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of october 1, 2020. of those trade names subjected to our quantitative analysis, one, associated with our lab software business, had a fair value approximately 20% in excess of its carrying value, as compared to 2019 when the fair value approximated its carrying value. the primary driver of the increase in the fair value from 2019 to 2020 was a decrease in the discount rate, primarily due to a reduced risk-free interest rate. a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a $2.8 impairment and a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in a fair value that approximates its carrying value.
the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses and/or reporting units. changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2020.
the most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships. the fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method. under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future after-tax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges. the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the customer attrition rates, projected customer revenue growth rates, margins, contributory asset charges and discount rates. when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical customer attrition patterns.
we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. if an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.

year ended december 31, 2020 compared to year ended december 31, 2019
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 were $5,527.1 as compared to $5,366.8 for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of 3.0%. the increase was the result of net acquisition/divestiture contribution of 3.9% and a foreign exchange benefit of 0.1%, partially offset by an organic decline of 1.0%.
in our application software segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by $211.9 or 13% over the year ended december 31, 2019. organic revenues increased by 1% and acquisitions accounted for 13% of our growth. the growth in organic revenues was primarily due to businesses serving healthcare and government contracting markets. gross margin increased to 68.3% for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 67.0% for the year ended december 31, 2019 due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues and revenue mix. selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended december 31, 2020 increased to 42.2%, as compared to 41.5% in the year ended december 31, 2019, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2020. the resulting operating margin was 26.0% in the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 25.5% in the year ended december 31, 2019.
our network software & systems segment reported a $209.1 or 14% increase in net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 over the year ended december 31, 2019. organic revenues increased by 4% and acquisitions accounted for 10% of our growth. the growth in organic revenues was led by our higher project activity at our toll and traffic business and subscription growth at our saas businesses. gross margin decreased to 67.1% for the year ended december 31, 2020 from 69.2% for the year ended december 31, 2019, due primarily to revenue mix. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 35.5% in the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to 34.0% in the year ended december 31, 2019, due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2019. the resulting operating margin was 31.6% in the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 35.2% in the year ended december 31, 2019.
net revenues for our measurement & analytical solutions segment decreased by $126.5 or 8% for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. organic revenues increased 1%, more than offset by a decrease in revenue of 9% attributable to the disposal of gatan and the imaging businesses. the growth in organic revenues was due to accelerated adoption of verathon's video-assisted intubation products that aid in reducing covid transmission to healthcare workers, partially offset by declines in our water meter technology business, due to restricted access to indoor meters located in the northeast united states and canada, and industrial business declines. gross margin increased to 59.2% in the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to 58.5% in the year ended december 31, 2019, due primarily to revenue mix. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively flat at 27.0% in the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to 27.1% in the year ended december 31, 2019. the resulting operating margin was 32.2% in the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 31.4% in the year ended december 31, 2019.
in our process technologies segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased by $134.2 or 21% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, all of which was organic. the decrease in organic revenues was due to broad-based revenue declines across the segment led by lower demand at our businesses serving upstream oil and gas end markets resulting from lower energy prices and the covid-19 pandemic. gross margin decreased to 53.5% in the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 56.9% in the year ended december 31, 2019, due primarily to lower revenues. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 28.1% in the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to 22.3% in the year ended december 31, 2019, due primarily to $13.6 of restructuring charges for structural cost reduction actions taken at certain of our businesses and lower operating leverage on organic revenue declines. as a result, operating margin was 25.4% in the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 34.6% in the year ended december 31, 2019.
corporate expenses increased by $20.1 to $192.5, or 3.5% of revenues, in 2020 as compared to $172.4, or 3.2% of revenues, in 2019. the dollar increase was due primarily to higher stock compensation expense and professional services.
interest expense, net, increased $32.3, or 17.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was due to (i) higher weighted average debt balances, partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates, and (ii) $7.2 in interest expense for the origination fee on our bridge financing associated with the vertafore acquisition.
other expense, net, of $2.9 and $5.1 for the year ended december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively, was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our non-u.s. based subsidiaries, partially offset by royalty income.
gain on disposal of businesses, resulted in a pretax gain of $920.7 for the year ended december 31, 2019. the company recognized $119.6 on the sale of the imaging businesses, which closed february 5, 2019, and $801.1 on the sale of gatan, which closed october 29, 2019.
during 2020, our effective income tax rate was 21.5% as compared to our 2019 rate of 20.6%. the increase was due primarily to the following non-recurring items in 2019, (i) recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $41.0 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses, and (ii) the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the excess of gatan's book basis over tax basis in the shares of $10.0 in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the imaging and gatan gains during 2019.
order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. backlog increased 27% to $2,516.1 at december 31, 2020 as compared to $1,985.4 at december 31, 2019, organic growth was 3% and acquisitions contributed 24%.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources all currency amounts are in millions unless specified selected cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:
2020                                                                       2019
cash provided by/(used in):
operating activities                   $1,525.1                     $1,461.8
investing activities                  (6,073.9)                    (1,296.0)
financing activities                    4,136.9                        177.0
operating activities - the growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 and in 2019 was primarily due to improvement in working capital, lower cash taxes paid excluding the tax associated with gain on disposal of businesses, and $43.7 of employer social security payroll taxes deferred during the year ended december 31, 2020, that are payable in installments in 2021 and 2022 under the u.s. coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security ("cares") act, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid of $201.9 on the disposal of gatan paid in 2020 as compared to $39.4 of cash taxes paid on the disposal of the imaging businesses in 2019.
investing activities - cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably vertafore and epsi. cash used in investing activities during 2019 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably ipipeline and foundry, partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of the gatan business and the imaging businesses.
financing activities - cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was primarily from the issuance of $3,300.0 of senior notes and $1,620.0 of net borrowings on the revolver, partially offset by $600.0 of repayments for senior notes and to a lesser extent dividend payments. cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was primarily from the issuance of $1,200.0 of senior notes partially offset by $865.0 of revolving debt repayments and to a lesser extent dividend payments.
net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was negative $498.4 at december 31, 2020 compared to negative $505.4 at december 31, 2019, due primarily to lower income taxes payable and increased accounts receivable, partially offset by increased deferred revenue and other accrued liabilities. the decrease in income taxes payable is due primarily to the $201.9 income tax cash payment associated with the divestiture of gatan. the deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscription-based services. consistent negative net working capital demonstrates roper's continued evolution and focus on asset-light business models.
total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was $9,626.2 at december 31, 2020 (47.9% of total capital) compared to $5,307.7 at december 31, 2019 (35.9% of total capital). our increased total debt at december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019 was due primarily to the issuance of $3,300.0 senior unsecured notes and $1,620.0 of revolving debt borrowings, partially offset by the redemption of $600.0 of outstanding 3.00% senior unsecured notes. the net proceeds were used primarily to fund the purchase price of the acquisition of vertafore.
on september 2, 2020, the company entered into a new three-year unsecured credit facility among roper, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, wells fargo bank, n.a. and bank of america, n.a., as syndication agents, and mufg bank, ltd., mizuho bank, ltd., pnc bank, national association, truist bank and td bank, n.a., as co-documentation agents, which replaced its existing $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility, dated as of september 23, 2016, as amended. the new facility comprises a three-year $3,000.0 revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150.0 for letters of credit. loans under the facility will be available in dollars, and letters of credit will be available in dollars and other currencies to be agreed. the company may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500.0.
the credit agreement requires the company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. borrowings under the credit agreement are prepayable at roper's option at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty.
we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019.
at december 31, 2020, we had $8,000.0 of senior unsecured notes and $1,620.0 of outstanding revolver borrowings. in addition, we had $6.2 of other debt in the form of finance leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-u.s. businesses. we had $67.1 of outstanding letters of credit at december 31, 2020, of which $29.0 was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.
we may redeem some or all of our senior unsecured notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to u.s. treasury securities.
see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes.
cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2020 totaled $259.1 as compared to $291.8 at december 31, 2019, a decrease of 11.2%. the decrease was due primarily to the repatriation of $373.4 during the year, partially offset by cash generated from foreign operations. we intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings.
capital expenditures of $31.2, $52.7 and $49.1 were incurred during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. capitalized software expenditures of $17.7, $10.2 and $9.5 were incurred during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2020 as compared to 2019 and 2018. in the future, we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 1.0% and 1.5%.

1 we have excluded the liability for uncertain tax positions and certain other tax liabilities as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments. see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
as of december 31, 2020, we had $716.9 of outstanding surety bonds. certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations.
we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements. although we maintain an active acquisition program we are committed to reducing debt. future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our business, financial condition and results of operations. such acquisitions may be financed by the use of existing credit lines, future cash flows from operations, future divestitures, the proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity securities or any combination of these methods, the terms and availability of which will be subject to market and economic conditions generally.
we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. however, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2021 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions, the financial performance of our existing companies and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business prospects and the financial markets generally. none of these factors can be predicted with certainty.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
recently issued accounting standards see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.

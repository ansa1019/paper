item 1a. risk factors.
our operations are affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. in evaluating investment in the company and the forward-looking information contained in this annual report on form 10-k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below. any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. in addition to the following risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.
risks related to economic conditions the covid-19 global pandemic may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the covid-19 global pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread have led to a significant decline of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets. these factors have led to reduced demand for industrial gas products, particularly in our merchant business. we expect demand to continue to be impacted as well as the timing of certain planned maintenance activities. in addition, covid-19 may result in reduced sales in our other businesses, lower returns for certain of our projects, and the potential delay or cancellation of certain projects in our pipeline. in addition, we are monitoring the health of our employees and many of our employees, including those based at our headquarters, are working remotely in accordance with health safety guidance and applicable governmental orders. action by health or other governmental authorities requiring the closure of our facilities or recommending other physical distancing measures could negatively impact our business and those of our service providers and customers. although we have business continuity and other safeguards in place, we cannot be certain that they will be fully effective for extended periods of time. as the pandemic and responses to it continue to evolve we may experience further adverse impacts on our operations and our ability to access capital on favorable terms, or at all, may be impaired. in addition, we may face unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products when restrictions on business and travel end. if demand for our products exceeds our capacity, it could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships. although the duration and ultimate impact of these factors is unknown at this time, the decline in economic conditions due to covid-19, or another disease-causing similar impacts, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and such impact may be material.
further, to the extent covid-19 adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.
table of contents changes in global and regional economic conditions, the markets we serve, or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies, the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash flows.
demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past, including most recently due to covid-19, and may do so in the future. reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings. in addition, reduced demand could depress sales, reduce our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits.
in addition, our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment. a decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services, and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated contract terminations, project delays or the inability to recover plant investments, any of which may negatively impact our financial results.
weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or other inabilities to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming on-stream when expected. these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market, product, or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.
our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal, and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability.
in fiscal year 2020, over 60% of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states and many of our operations, suppliers, and employees are located outside the united states. our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations, import and trade restrictions, trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting u.s. companies doing business abroad. changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, strained relations between countries, or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states, particularly in markets such as china, india, indonesia, and the middle east, and involve significantly larger and more complex projects, including gasification projects, some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. we are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources, in some cases through joint ventures, in developing markets, which we believe to have high growth potential. our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. in addition, our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation, respectively, without full compensation for loss. successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time.
table of contents furthermore, because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the united states, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. we choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' earnings into dollars. accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, below.
risks related to our business operational and project execution risks, particularly with respect to our largest projects, may adversely affect our operations or financial results.
a significant and growing portion of our business involves gasification and other large-scale projects that involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may last up to several years. these projects are technically complex, often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities and face significant financing, development, operational and reputational risks. we may encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and materials delivery delays, schedule changes, customer scope changes, delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rights-of-way, inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants, weather-related delays, delays by customers' contractors in completing their portion of a project, technical or transportation difficulties, cost overruns, supply difficulties, geopolitical risks and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule. in some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. we may not be able to recover any of these costs. in addition, in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing. these financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which, if not met, could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses. all of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties, any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future.
the operation of our facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. if operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flows. in addition, our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements, which depend, in part, on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets.
we are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. regulations addressing, among other things, import/export restrictions, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
we are subject to government regulation in the united states and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business. the application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear. compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability. if there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results. compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional, unplanned capital expenditures. export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses. increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirements, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the united kingdom bribery act and the china anti-unfair competition law, could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred. in addition, we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the u.s. and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us, or certain of our affiliates, from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct. such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities.
table of contents further, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy. any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. in addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.
we may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, or effectively disentangle divested businesses.
our ability to grow revenue, earnings, and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify, successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices, and realize expected growth, synergies, and operating efficiencies. we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. in addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses, the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance. in addition, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations.
we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. for example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all. in addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes with buyers. in addition, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities. our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions.
the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.
we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain our internal controls environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency. our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach. in addition, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, and may subject us to legal liability.
as with most large systems, our information technology systems have in the past been, and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. to date, we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could: interrupt our operations at one or more sites; delay production and shipments; result in the theft of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets; damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation; result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws, or increased costs for security and remediation; or raise concerns regarding our internal controls environment and internal controls over financial reporting. each of these consequences could adversely affect our business, reputation and our financial statements.
table of contents our business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our employees, vendors, and customers. the protection of such information, as well as our proprietary information, is critical to us. the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. we also, from time to time, export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states. breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability. these events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.
interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.
hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of our business. because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings. a disruption in the supply of energy, components, or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, natural events, or other disruption, could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results.
our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers. lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics, supplier operating or transportation issues or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers, can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers.
we typically contract to pass-through cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers, but cost variability can still have a negative impact on our results. we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs. increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings. even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.
new technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation.
we are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings. existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base. these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. failure of the technologies to work as predicted, or unintended consequences of new designs or uses, could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or damage to our reputation. in addition, large scale gasification projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination, and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others, such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations. additionally, there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and replaced by other market alternatives. performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. in addition, performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts for gasification projects.
protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights.
as we develop new technologies, it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against third-party infringement. we own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services. as we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted, or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests. we may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against third-party infringement. it is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm.
table of contents legal and regulatory risks legislative, regulatory and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk.
we are the world's leading supplier of hydrogen, the primary use of which is the production of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health. to make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers, we use steam methane reforming, which releases carbon dioxide. in addition, although gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and value-added products, our gasification projects will increase our carbon footprint because the gasification process produces carbon dioxide. some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing ghg emissions, including co2, which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations. furthermore, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs.
increased public concern and governmental action may result in more international, u.s. federal and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg emissions. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.
our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.
we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. while we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable. also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular period.
costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.
we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products. future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. in addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. these additional costs may adversely affect our financial results. for a more detailed description of these matters, see item 1, business-environmental regulation, above.
table of contents a change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense.
the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. in december 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"), which significantly revised the u.s. federal corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on accumulated, unremitted non-u.s. earnings of foreign subsidiaries. various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. further changes in tax laws in the u.s. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
we could incur significant liability if the distribution of versum common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.
we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the spin-off of versum qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(d) of the internal revenue code. the opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from versum and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the irs could determine on audit that the spin-off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. if the spin-off is determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to u.s. federal income tax and we could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities.
general risk factors catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows.
our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war and terrorism. any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to third-party liability claims. additionally, such events could impact our suppliers, customers and partners, which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us, or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results.
the united kingdom's ("uk") exit from european union ("eu") membership could adversely affect our european operations.
the uk's exit from eu membership may adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business. although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom's future relationship with the eu will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu members and increased regulatory complexities. any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our european business overall.
inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.
we face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments. introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for, or impact pricing of our products, negatively impacting financial results. in addition, competitors' pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share.

this management's discussion and analysis contains "forward-looking statements" within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including statements about business outlook. these forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions as of the date of this annual report and are not guarantees of future performance. actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, those described in forward-looking statements and item 1a, risk factors, of this annual report on form 10-k.
the discussion that follows includes a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal years 2020 and 2019. for the discussion of changes from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019 and other financial information related to fiscal year 2018, refer to part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, of our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2019. this document was filed with the sec on 26 november 2019.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this annual report. unless otherwise stated, financial information is presented in millions of dollars, except for per share data. except for net income, which includes the results of discontinued operations, financial information is presented on a continuing operations basis.
the financial measures included in the discussion that follows are presented in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), except as noted. we present certain financial measures on an "adjusted," or "non-gaap," basis because we believe such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with gaap, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance. for each non-gaap financial measure, including adjusted diluted earnings per share ("eps"), adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, and adjusted effective tax rate, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap. these reconciliations and explanations regarding the use of these measures are presented beginning on page 31.
in march 2020, the world health organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus, covid-19, a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. in response to covid-19, we implemented certain health and safety policies to help keep our employees, contractors, customers, and communities safe while continuing to run our facilities, which generally have been considered "essential" by local governments and public health authorities. in compliance with government protocols, our non-essential employees were instructed to work from home until government mandated restrictions allow for a return to the workplace. those working and visiting our sites are required to follow appropriate procedures, including completion of trainings and performance of self- and on-site screenings, as well as adhere to our personal protective equipment, social distancing, and personal hygiene protocols.

with operations in 50 countries, in fiscal year 2020 we had sales of $8.9 billion and assets of $25.2 billion. approximately 19,275 passionate, talented and committed full- and part-time employees from diverse backgrounds are driven by air products' higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability and address the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world.
as of 30 september 2020, our operations were organized into five reportable business segments:
•industrial gases - americas;
•industrial gases - emea (europe, middle east, and africa);
•industrial gases - asia;
•industrial gases - global; and
•corporate and other this management's discussion and analysis discusses our results based on these operations. refer to note 25, business segment and geographic information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.
2020 in summary in fiscal year 2020, our number one priority was the safety and well-being of our people. since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, we have kept our global plants running, supplied critical products, and supported our local communities during this time of need. we continued to win significant new growth projects around the world and serve our customers, delivering stable results despite the significant health crisis facing the world. we also remained focused on sustainability and our commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion. we set new goals that are aligned with air products' business strategy and higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability, and address the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world.
fiscal year 2020 results and highlights are summarized below:
•sales of $8,856.3 decreased 1%, or $62.6, as 3% higher pricing and 2% favorable volumes were more than offset by 4% lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, 1% unfavorable currency, and the 1% impact of a contract modification to a tolling arrangement in india. we estimate that covid-19 negatively impacted our overall sales by approximately 4%, primarily driven by lower volumes in our merchant business in the regional industrial gas segments.
•operating income of $2,237.6 increased 4%, or $93.2, and operating margin of 25.3% increased 130 bp.
•net income of $1,931.1 increased 7%, or $121.7, and net income margin of 21.8% increased 150 bp.
•adjusted ebitda of $3,619.8 increased 4%, or $151.8, and adjusted ebitda margin of 40.9% increased 200 bp.
•diluted eps of $8.55 increased 8%, or $0.61, and adjusted diluted eps of $8.38 increased 2%, or $0.17. we estimate that covid-19 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2020 eps by approximately $0.60-$0.65 per share. a summary table of changes in diluted eps is presented below.
table of contents fiscal year 2020 results and highlights (continued):
•we increased our quarterly dividend by over 15% from $1.16 to $1.34 per share, representing the largest dividend increase in our 80-year history. this is the 38th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.

2021 outlook as covid-19 continues, we remain focused on the safety and well-being of our people. we are committed to safely maintaining plant operations and ensuring business continuity, including providing financial security for employees, reliably supplying critical products and services to our customers, and winning new opportunities for world-scale projects.
we expect lower volumes from covid-19 to continue into fiscal year 2021 with recovery in demand depending on the duration of covid-19 and measures implemented by governments, public health authorities and businesses to mitigate its spread. given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the future impact on our ongoing business, results of operations, and overall financial performance cannot be reasonably estimated.
despite the uncertainty of the duration of covid-19, we will continue to focus on pricing discipline in our merchant business and expect our onsite business model, which represents approximately half of our business, to continue generating stable cash flow. this will allow us to execute our strategic focus on our industrial gas business and the creation of long-term shareholder value, including the ongoing growth of our dividend, continued execution of projects in our backlog, and new investments in high-return industrial gas projects.
a long-term onsite customer in asia delayed restarting their plant following a planned major maintenance turnaround completed in september 2020. while we expect the plant to restart in fiscal year 2021, we are negotiating with the customer regarding contract terms that could impact sales in our industrial gases - asia segment.
the above guidance should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements of this annual report on form 10-k.

(a)includes the impact from the modification of a hydrogen supply contract to a tolling arrangement in india in december 2018 (the "india contract modification").
sales of $8,856.3 decreased 1%, or $62.6, as higher pricing of 3% and favorable volumes of 2% were more than offset by lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 4%, unfavorable currency of 1%, and the impact from the india contract modification of 1%. the pricing improvement was attributable to our merchant business across the regional segments. the volume growth exceeded the negative impacts from covid-19 and was primarily driven by acquisitions, new plants, and higher sale of equipment project activity. we estimate that covid-19 negatively impacted overall sales by approximately 4%, primarily driven by lower volumes in our merchant business across the regional segments as our onsite business remained stable. unfavorable currency impacts were driven by the chilean peso, chinese renminbi, euro, and south korean won.
cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales of $5,858.1 decreased 2%, or $146.4, from total cost of sales of $6,004.5 in the prior year, which included the facility closure further discussed below. the decrease from the prior year was driven by lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of $314, positive currency impacts of $73, the favorable impact from the india contract modification of $41, and the prior year facility closure of $29, partially offset by higher costs attributable to sales volumes of $250 and higher other costs, including planned maintenance, of $61. gross margin of 33.9% increased 120 bp from 32.7% in the prior year, primarily due to positive pricing, lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, and the prior year facility closure, partially offset by unfavorable volume mix and net operating costs.
facility closure in fiscal year 2019, one of our customers was subject to a government enforced shutdown due to environmental reasons. as a result, we recognized a charge of $29.0 ($22.1 after-tax, or $0.10 per share) primarily related to the write-off of onsite assets. this charge was reflected as "facility closure" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2019 and was not recorded in segment results.
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense of $775.9 increased 3%, or $25.9, due to higher business development costs to support our growth strategy and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by currency impacts and lower travel expenses. selling and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales, increased from 8.4% to 8.8%.
research and development research and development expense of $83.9 increased 15%, or $11.0, primarily due to higher product development costs. research and development expense as a percentage of sales increased from 0.8% to 0.9%.
company headquarters relocation income (expense)
during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we sold property at our current corporate headquarters located in trexlertown, pennsylvania, for net proceeds of $44.1. the sale was completed in anticipation of relocating our u.s. headquarters and resulted in a gain of $33.8 ($25.6 after-tax, or $0.12 per share). this gain is reflected on our consolidated income statements as "company headquarters relocation income (expense)" for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020 and was not recorded in segment results.
table of contents cost reduction actions in fiscal year 2019, we recognized an expense of $25.5 ($18.8 after-tax, or $0.08 per share) for severance and other benefits associated with position eliminations, primarily within the industrial gases - emea and the industrial gases - americas segments. this expense was reflected as "cost reduction actions" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2019 and was not recorded in segment results. refer to note 5, cost reduction actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments in fiscal year 2019, we recognized a net gain of $29.1 ($0.13 per share) resulting from the exchange of two 50%-owned industrial gas joint ventures in china. the net gain was reflected as "gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2019 and was not recorded in segment results. refer to note 3, acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net of $65.4 increased 33%, or $16.1, primarily due to the adjustment of a benefit plan liability resulting from a change in plan terms.
operating income and margin operating income of $2,237.6 increased 4%, or $93.2, due to positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $212, income associated with the company headquarters relocation of $34, and prior year charges for a facility closure of $29 and cost reduction actions of $26, partially offset by higher net operating costs of $104, including planned maintenance, unfavorable volume mix of $55, a gain on the exchange of equity affiliates of $29 in the prior year, and unfavorable currency of $20.
operating margin of 25.3% increased 130 bp, primarily due to positive pricing, lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, the impact of income associated with the company headquarters relocation, and prior year charges for a facility closure and cost reduction actions, partially offset by unfavorable volume mix, higher operating costs, and a gain on the exchange of two equity affiliates in the prior year.
equity affiliates' income equity affiliates' income of $264.8 increased 23%, or $49.4, primarily due to a current year benefit of $33.8 for the release of our share of accumulated dividend distribution taxes related to an indian affiliate as a result of the enactment of a tax law in india. refer to note 22, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. the current year also includes higher income from affiliates in india, italy, and saudi arabia, partially offset by negative impacts from covid-19.

interest incurred decreased 17%, or $25.3. the prior year included an expense of $33.3 related to foreign currency forward points and currency swap basis differences ("excluded components") of our cash flow hedges of intercompany loans. as discussed in note 2, new accounting guidance, to the consolidated financial statements, we adopted new accounting guidance on hedging activities that changed the presentation of these items from "interest expense, net" to "other non-operating income (expense), net" in fiscal year 2020. in addition to this presentation change, interest incurred decreased due to lower expenses related to the lu'an joint venture financing and a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio, partially offset by a higher debt balance due to the issuance of debt during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. refer to note 15, debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. we expect interest expense to be higher in future periods due to this issuance. capitalized interest increased 18%, or $2.4, due to an increase in the carrying value of projects under construction.
table of contents other non-operating income (expense), net other non-operating income of $30.7 decreased 54%, or $36.0, primarily due to an expense of $33.5 for the excluded components of cash flow hedges of intercompany loans. these components were historically recorded in "interest expense" prior to the adoption of the guidance discussed above. the current year also included lower interest income on cash and cash items. these factors were partially offset by higher non-service pension income due to lower interest cost and higher expected asset returns, primarily for our u.s. pension plans. the prior year includes a settlement loss of $5.0 ($3.8 after-tax, or $0.02 per share) associated with the u.s. supplementary pension plan.
discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we recorded a pre-tax loss from discontinued operations of $19.0 ($14.3 after-tax, or $0.06 per share) to increase our liability for retained environmental obligations associated with the sale of our former amines business in september 2006. refer to the pace discussion within note 17, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
net income and net income margin net income of $1,931.1 increased 7%, or $121.7, primarily due to higher pricing and income from the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters. in addition, the prior year was negatively impacted by a facility closure, cost reduction actions, and the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act. these factors were partially offset by higher costs, including the after-tax loss from discontinued operations, unfavorable volume mix, and a gain on the exchange of two equity affiliates in the prior year. net income margin of 21.8% increased 150 bp, primarily due to the factors noted above as well as lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers.
adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda of $3,619.8 increased 4%, or $151.8, primarily due to higher pricing, partially offset by higher operating costs. adjusted ebitda margin of 40.9% increased 200 bp, primarily due to the higher pricing and lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, partially offset by unfavorable volume mix and higher operating costs.
effective tax rate the effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. the effective tax rate was 19.7% and 21.0% for the fiscal years ended 30 september 2020 and 2019, respectively.
the 2019 tax rate reflected a discrete net income tax expense of $43.8 related to impacts from the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the net expense included the reversal of a non-recurring $56.2 ($0.26 per share) benefit recorded in 2018 related to the u.s. taxation of deemed foreign dividends. this was partially offset by a benefit of $12.4 ($0.06 per share) to finalize our estimates of the impacts of the tax act and reduce the total expected costs of the deemed repatriation tax. in addition, the net expense from the tax act was partially offset by benefits from changes in valuation allowance recorded at various entities in 2019.
the lower current year rate reflects favorable impacts from higher benefits on the revaluation of deferred tax accounts due to enacted changes in foreign tax law, changes in the tax profile of u.s. entities in various state jurisdictions, and higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. these items were partially offset by the enactment of the india finance act 2020 (the "india finance act"), which increased income tax expense by $20.3. the enactment also increased equity affiliates' income by $33.8 for changes in the future tax costs of repatriated earnings. the overall impact to net income resulting from the india finance act was a benefit of $13.5 ($0.06 per share).
the adjusted effective tax rate was 19.1% and 19.4% for the fiscal years ended 30 september 2020 and 2019, respectively. the lower current year rate reflects favorable impacts from higher benefits on the revaluation of deferred tax accounts due to enacted changes in foreign tax law, changes in the tax profile of u.s. entities in various state jurisdictions, and higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. these items were partially offset by benefits from changes in valuation allowances recorded at various entities in 2019.

reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures
(millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for per share data)
we present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), on an "adjusted" or "non-gaap" basis. on a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share ("eps"), adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, and adjusted effective tax rate. on a segment basis, these measures include adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin. in addition to these measures, we also include certain supplemental non-gaap financial measures that are presented below to help the reader understand the impact that our non-gaap adjustments have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted eps. for each non-gaap financial measure, we present below a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap.
our non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap. we believe these non-gaap financial measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of our business because such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with gaap, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results.
in many cases, non-gaap financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap measure to exclude certain disclosed items, or "non-gaap adjustments," that we believe are not representative of underlying business performance. for example, we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. the reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-gaap financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.
the tax impact on our pre-tax non-gaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-gaap adjustments. these tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.
table of contents adjusted diluted eps the table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of our non-gaap adjustments as management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. the per share impact for each non-gaap adjustment was calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted diluted eps due to rounding.

table of contents adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin we define adjusted ebitda as net income less income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-gaap adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance. margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding.
below is a presentation of consolidated sales and a reconciliation of net income on a gaap basis to adjusted ebitda and net income margin on a gaap basis to adjusted ebitda margin:

liquidity and capital resources our cash balance and cash flows from operations are our primary sources of liquidity and are generally sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. in addition, we have the flexibility to access capital through a variety of financing activities, including accessing the capital markets, drawing upon our credit facility, or alternatively, accessing the commercial paper markets. during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we issued u.s. dollar- and euro-denominated fixed-rate notes with aggregate principal amounts of $3.8 billion and €1.0 billion ($1.2 billion as of 30 september 2020), respectively. we intend to use the majority of the proceeds to fund growth projects and repay debt maturities through 2021, including a €350.0 million eurobond due in june 2021. at this time, we have not utilized, nor do we expect to access, our credit facility for additional liquidity. in addition, we have considered the impacts of covid-19 on our liquidity and capital resources and do not expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs.
as of 30 september 2020, we had $1,376.6 of foreign cash and cash items compared to total cash and cash items of $5,253.0. since the enactment of the tax act, we do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to u.s. income tax upon repatriation to the u.s. depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside, the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. however, since we have significant current investment plans outside the u.s., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the u.s.
table of contents the table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended 30 september:

financing activities                    3,284.7         (1,370.5)
operating activities for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $3,264.7. income from continuing operations of $1,901.0 was adjusted for items including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, gain on sale of assets and investments, share-based compensation, noncurrent capital lease receivables, and certain other adjustments. we recorded a net benefit of $13.5 on our consolidated income statements related to a recently enacted tax law in india during the second quarter. this net benefit, which is further discussed in note 22, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements, increased "undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates" by $33.8 and increased "deferred income taxes" by $20.3. the "gain on sale of assets and investments" of $45.8 includes a gain of $33.8 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters. refer to note 23, supplemental information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. the working capital accounts were a use of cash of $40.1, primarily driven by other working capital uses of $130.6, partially offset by a source of $84.4 from other receivables. the use of cash within "other working capital" was primarily due to timing of tax payments and a tax benefit as a result of the assets acquired in april 2020 from pbf energy inc. the source of cash within "other receivables" was primarily driven by maturities of forward exchange contracts.
for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $2,969.9, including income from continuing operations of $1,760.0. the gain on sale of assets and investments included a gain of $14.1 recognized on the disposition of our interest in high-tech gases (beijing) co., ltd., a previously held equity investment in our industrial gases - asia segment. refer to note 3, acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. the working capital accounts were a use of cash of $25.3, primarily driven by $69.0 from trade receivables and $41.8 from payables and accrued liabilities, partially offset by $79.8 from other receivables. the use of cash within "payables and accrued liabilities" was primarily driven by a $48.9 decrease in accrued utilities and a $30.3 decrease in accrued interest, partially offset by a $51.6 increase in customer advances primarily related to sale of equipment activity. the decrease in accrued utilities was primarily driven by a contract modification to a tolling arrangement in india and lower utility costs in the industrial gases - americas segment. the source of cash from other receivables of $79.8 was primarily due to the maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposures and the collection of value added taxes.
investing activities for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020, cash used for investing activities was $3,560.0. payments for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,509.0. this includes the acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from pbf energy inc. in delaware and california for approximately $580 during the third quarter. additionally, acquisitions, less cash acquired, includes $183.3 for three businesses we acquired on 1 july 2020, the largest of which was a business in israel that primarily offers merchant gas products. refer to note 3, acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. purchases of investments of $2,865.5 relate to time deposits and treasury securities with terms greater than three months and less than one year and exceeded proceeds from investments of $1,938.0. proceeds from sale of assets and investments of $80.3 includes net proceeds of $44.1 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters in the second quarter.
for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2019, cash used for investing activities was $2,113.4. payments for additions to plant and equipment totaled $1,989.7. cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $123.2. refer to note 3, acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for further details. proceeds from investments of $190.5 resulting from maturities of short-term instruments with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year exceeded purchases of $172.1.
table of contents capital expenditures capital expenditures is a non-gaap measure that we define as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. a reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our reported capital expenditures is provided below:

capital expenditures in fiscal year 2020 totaled $2,716.7 compared to $2,128.6 in fiscal year 2019. the increase of $588.1 was primarily due to the acquisition of the hydrogen production plants from pbf energy inc., as noted above. additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements.
2021 outlook for investing activities due to the significant uncertainty that remains regarding the duration of covid-19, the pace of recovery, and its negative impact on the global economy, we are not providing capital expenditure guidance for fiscal year 2021. we are monitoring our projects to determine whether capital spending and project onstream timing may be delayed for those currently under construction.
we anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. in addition, we intend to continue to evaluate (1) acquisitions of small- and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies; (2) purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and (3) investment in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth.
financing activities in fiscal year 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $3,284.7 as we successfully accessed the debt markets in april 2020 to support opportunities for growth projects and repay upcoming debt maturities. long-term debt proceeds of $4,895.8, as further discussed below under "financing and capital structure," were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of $1,103.6 and payments on long-term debt of $406.6 primarily related to the repayment of a 2.0% eurobond of €300.0 million ($353.9) that matured on 7 august 2020. other financing activities were a use of cash of $80.1 and included financing charges associated with the third quarter debt issuance.
for the fiscal year ended 2019, cash used for financing activities was $1,370.5. this use of cash was largely attributable to dividend payments to shareholders of $994.0 and payments on long-term debt of $428.6. payments on long-term debt primarily related to the repayment of a 4.375% u.s. senior note of $400.0 that matured on 21 august 2019.
table of contents financing and capital structure capital needs in fiscal year 2020 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. total debt increased from $3,326.0 at 30 september 2019 to $7,907.8 at 30 september 2020 due to the issuance of u.s. dollar- and euro-denominated fixed-rate notes in the third quarter, partially offset by the repayment of a 2.0% eurobond. for additional information, refer to note 15, debt, to the consolidated financial statements. similarly, cash and cash items and short-term investments increased from $2,248.7 and $166.0, respectively, at the end of 2019 to $5,253.0 and $1,104.9, respectively, at the end of 2020, primarily due to the issuance of the notes. the current year total debt balance includes $338.5 of related party debt associated with the lu'an joint venture.
we have a $2,300.0 five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the "credit agreement") maturing 31 march 2022. under the credit agreement, senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. the credit agreement provides us a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. our only financial covenant under the credit agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization, or total debt plus total equity, no greater than 70%. total debt as of 30 september 2020 and 30 september 2019, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization was 38.9% and 22.6%, respectively. no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of 30 september 2020.
there were no commitments maintained by our foreign subsidiaries at 30 september 2020.
as of 30 september 2020, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.
on 15 september 2011, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. we did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2020 or 2019. as of 30 september 2020, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains.
dividends dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. in 2020, the board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by over 15% from $1.16 to $1.34 per share, representing the largest dividend increase in our 80-year history. this is the 38th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.
on 19 november 2020, the board of directors declared the first quarter 2021 dividend of $1.34 per share. the dividend is payable on 8 february 2021 to shareholders of record as of 4 january 2021.
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. the following table summarizes our obligations on a continuing operations basis as of 30 september 2020:
total            2021            2022            2023            2024            2025        thereafter debt maturities                                                      $7,950            $470            $442            $456            $456            $416          $5,710

table of contents debt obligations our debt obligations include the maturity payments of the principal amount of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties, and the related contractual interest obligations. refer to note 15, debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our debt obligations.
contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. we had approximately $632 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2020, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2020. variable interest rates are primarily determined by u.s. short-term tax-exempt interest rates and by interbank offer rates.
leases we are the lessee under various agreements for real estate, vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment. refer to note 12, leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
pension obligations the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that, in total, equal the recognized pension liabilities for our u.s. and international pension plans. for additional information, refer to note 16, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment.
the total accrued liability for pension benefits may be impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions.
unconditional purchase obligations we are obligated to make future payments under unconditional purchase obligations, which primarily relate to helium and rare gases as well as commitments for purchases of plant and equipment. for additional information, refer to note 17, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.
income tax liabilities tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 september 2020 were $237.0. these tax liabilities are not included in the table above as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. in addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. however, the table above includes our accrued liability of approximately $211 for deemed repatriation tax that is payable through 2026 related to the tax act. refer to note 22, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate on 19 april 2015, a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco's oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan, saudi arabia. we guaranteed the repayment of our 25% share of an equity bridge loan that has been provided to fund equity commitments to the joint venture. in total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. as of 30 september 2020, our consolidated balance sheets included $94.4 reflected within "payables and accrued liabilities" for our obligation to make future equity contributions in 2021 based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan.
future investment in jazan gas and power project on 12 august 2018, air products entered an agreement to form a gasification/power joint venture ("jv") with saudi aramco and acwa in jazan, saudi arabia. air products expects to own 51% of the jv, with saudi aramco and acwa power owning the balance. in july 2020, we commenced the process to secure project financing with our partners for the jv, which will purchase the gasification assets, power block, and the associated utilities from saudi aramco for approximately $12 billion. our future investment is not considered a contractual obligation until definitive agreements have been signed; therefore, it is not included in the contractual obligations table above.
table of contents pension benefits we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. the principal defined benefit pension plans are the u.s. salaried pension plan and the u.k. pension plan. these plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.
the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 september 2020 measurement date increased to $4,775.1 from $4,504.8 at the end of fiscal year 2019. the projected benefit obligation for these plans was $5,373.5 and $5,145.6 at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. the net unfunded liability decreased $42.4 from $640.8 to $598.4, primarily due to favorable asset experience. refer to note 16, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits.

weighted average discount rate - service cost                                     2.4   %       3.4   %
weighted average discount rate - interest cost                                    2.3   %       3.4   %
weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets                           6.3   %       6.4   %
weighted average expected rate of compensation increase                           3.4   %       3.5   %
pension expense decreased from the prior year due to lower interest cost and higher total assets, partially offset by higher actuarial loss amortization due to the impact of lower discount rates. special items (settlements, termination benefits, and curtailments) decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses. in fiscal year 2020, special items of $5.2 included pension settlement losses of $5.0 related to lump sum payouts from the u.s. supplementary pension plan. these amounts are reflected within "other non-operating income (expense), net" on the consolidated income statements. in fiscal year 2019, special items of $7.2 included pension settlement losses of $6.4 related to lump sum payouts from the u.s. supplementary pension plan and $0.8 of termination benefits.
u.k. lloyds equalization ruling on 26 october 2018, the united kingdom high court issued a ruling related to the equalization of pension plan participants' benefits for the gender effects of guaranteed minimum pensions. as a result of this ruling, we estimated the impact of retroactively increasing benefits in our u.k. plan in accordance with the high court ruling. we treated the additional benefits as a prior service cost, which resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive loss of $4.7 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. we are amortizing this cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the u.k. participants.
2021 outlook in fiscal year 2021, we expect pension income of approximately $25 to $35, which includes expected pension settlement losses of $0 to $5, depending on the timing of retirements. the expected income range reflects lower expected interest cost and higher total assets. in fiscal year 2021, we expect our net pension income to include approximately $100 for amortization of actuarial losses.
in fiscal year 2020, pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $103.2. net actuarial losses of $83.5 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2020. actuarial (gains) losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial (gains) losses and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2021.
pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. with respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.
table of contents in addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. with the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. during 2020 and 2019, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $37.5 and $40.2, respectively.
for fiscal year 2021, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $45 to $55. the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. we do not expect covid-19 to impact our contribution forecast for fiscal year 2021. refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 38 for a projection of future contributions.
environmental matters as discussed above in item 1, "business-environmental regulation", we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations, which results in higher capital expenditures and costs. the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $18.3 and $14.2 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet our internal standards. we estimate that we spent approximately $4 and $5, in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, on capital projects reflected in continuing operations to control pollution. we expect that our capital expenditures to control pollution will be approximately $6 in both fiscal years 2021 and 2022.
our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1, major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 17, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 17, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. in addition, we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
related party transactions see note 23, supplemental information, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning activity with our related parties.
inflation we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis.
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates note 1, major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. however, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management's significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee.
depreciable lives of plant and equipment net plant and equipment at 30 september 2020 totaled $11,964.7, and depreciation expense totaled $1,150.5 during fiscal year 2020. plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.
economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially when business circumstances change. for example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, excessive wear and tear, or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. in these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.
the regional industrial gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer's facility. these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term supply contracts are matched to the contract lives. extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. as contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.
our regional industrial gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors' actions, etc.
in addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets, the remaining duration of long-term supply contracts served by the assets, and our historical experience with similar assets. management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change.
table of contents impairment of assets while our results of operations have been negatively affected by covid-19 as of and for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020, there have been no triggering events that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups, reporting units that contain goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or equity method investments. as further discussed below, we completed our annual impairment tests and concluded there were no indications of impairment. we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of covid-19 impacts on our business and any impact they may have on management's estimates, particularly those for our latin america business. the duration and severity of the covid-19 outbreak and its long-term impact on our business is uncertain.
impairment of assets - plant and equipment plant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign government-imposed restrictions or expropriations. plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.
if such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. if an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group's fair value and its carrying value. an estimate of the asset group's fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.
the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management's best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios. changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.
in fiscal year 2020, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset groupings may not be recoverable.
impairment of assets - goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. goodwill was $891.5 as of 30 september 2020. disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10, goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.
we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. the tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. we have five reportable business segments, seven operating segments and ten reporting units, seven of which include a goodwill balance. refer to note 25, business segment and geographic information, for additional information. reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments.
table of contents as part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. however, we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or adjusted ebitda margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or adjusted ebitda assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates.
if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. when the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. when both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test. we determined that the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value except for our latin america reporting unit (lasa), which is further discussed below. substantially all of the remaining goodwill balance related to reporting units in which the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 100%.
the fair value of lasa exceeded its carrying value by 10%. revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value. we determined that, with other assumptions held constant, a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 320 basis points or a decrease in adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 290 basis points would result in the fair value of the reporting unit being equal to its carrying value. as of 30 september 2020, the carrying value of lasa goodwill was $56.1, or less than 1% of consolidated total assets. the carrying value of lasa's other material assets at 30 september 2020 included: plant and equipment, net of $309.2; customer relationships of $112.1; and trade names and trademarks of $38.2. the trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets.
future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, changes in the strategy of the reporting unit, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.
table of contents impairment of assets - intangible assets intangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 september 2020 totaled $394.8 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. see the impairment discussion above under "impairment of assets - plant and equipment" for a description of how impairment losses are determined.
indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 september 2020 totaled $41.0 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. to determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.
disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in note 11, intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements.
in the fourth quarter of 2020, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles which resulted in no impairment.
impairment of assets - equity method investments investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,432.2 at 30 september 2020. the majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8, summarized financial information of equity affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
an impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs. management's estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. we utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach. for the market approach, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies. changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.
in fiscal year 2020, there was no need to test any of our equity affiliate investments for impairment, as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.
revenue recognition - cost incurred input method revenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. we use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer.
accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule and technical issues, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. when adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
table of contents in addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities, our sale of equipment projects within our industrial gases - global segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract.
changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method, including the jazan project, favorably impacted operating income by approximately $7 and $37 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years.
we assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.
revenue recognition - on-site customer contracts for customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own and operate on or near the customer's facilities. certain of these on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition.
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. as of 30 september 2020, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded as noncurrent, was $296.7, and net deferred tax liabilities were $847.5. tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2020 were $237.0, excluding interest and penalties. income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020 was $478.4. disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 22, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.
management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.
deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. however, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.
a 1% increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income, respectively, of approximately $24.
table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans.
actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. we determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. note 16, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the u.s. and international plans. the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. mortality rates are based on the most recent u.s. and international mortality tables. we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. however, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover.
one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. we measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. the rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. these rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. a 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $26 per year.
the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. in determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans' liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. a 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $22 per year.
we use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. for equities, this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. the market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value. expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.
the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. we determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. a 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $12 per year.
loss contingencies in the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company. we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. when only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
table of contents contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1, major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in note 17, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. for example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share of the liability increases. similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.
new accounting guidance see note 2, new accounting guidance, and note 12, leases, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.

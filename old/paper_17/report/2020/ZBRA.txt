item 1a.risk factors investors should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties, and other factors described below, as well as other disclosures in this report, including management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, because they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and growth prospects. these risks are not the only risks we face. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. no priority or significance is intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.
general business and industry risks the company is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of our business. we have grown rapidly over the last several years through acquisition and worldwide growth. this growth has caused increased complexities in the business. we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business. the following factors could present difficulties to us:
•managing our distribution channel partners;
•managing our contract manufacturing and supply chain;
•manufacturing an increased number of products;
•developing and managing custom solutions offerings;
•managing parties to whom we have outsourced portions of our business operations;
•managing administrative and operational burdens;
•managing stakeholder interests including customer, investor and employee social responsibility matters;
•maintaining and improving information technology infrastructure to support growth;
•managing the integration of acquisitions;
•managing logistical problems common to complex, expansive operations;
•managing our international operations; and
•attracting, developing and retaining individuals with the requisite technical expertise to develop new technologies and introduce new products and solutions.
inability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price. our ability to expand revenues, earnings, and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies. acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms.
the company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes, including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption. acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results. we may acquire or make investments in other businesses, technologies, services, products, or solutions. an acquisition may present business issues which are new to us. the process of integrating any acquired business, technology, service, or product into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention, which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business. these and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized.
acquisitions also may involve a number of risks, including:
•difficulties and uncertainties in retaining the customers or other business relationships from the acquired entities;
•the loss of key employees of acquired entities;
•the ability of acquired entities to fulfill their customers' obligations;
•the inheritance of known, and the discovery of unknown, issues or liabilities;
•pre-closing and post-closing acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results and cash flows in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period;
•the failure of acquired entities to meet or exceed expected operating results or cash flows could result in impairment of goodwill or intangible assets acquired;
•the ability to implement internal controls and accounting systems necessary to be compliant with requirements applicable to public companies subject to sec reporting, which could result in misstated financial reports; and
•future acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, and goodwill impairment charges.
the company may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change. to be successful, we must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products and solutions, as well as introducing new products, solutions, and services, to address user demands.
the company's industry is characterized by:
•evolving industry standards;
•frequent new product, solution, and service introductions;
•evolving distribution channels;
•increasing demand for customized product and software solutions;
•changing customer demands; and
•changing security protocols.
future success will depend on our ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment. we could incur substantial costs if we must modify our business to adapt to these changes, and may even be unable to adapt to these changes.
the company participates in a competitive industry, which may become more competitive. competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements. we face significant competition in developing and selling our products and solutions. to remain competitive, we believe we must continue to effectively and economically provide:
•technologically advanced systems that satisfy user demands;
•superior customer service;
•high levels of quality and reliability; and
•dependable and efficient distribution networks.
we cannot assure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or technologies. increased competition in mobile computing products, data capture products, radio frequency identification devices ("rfid"), printers, supplies, or software-based solutions may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins, and loss of market share, and could require increased spending on research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products and solutions, which may create additional pressures on our competitive position in the marketplace.
operational risks the company has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of our products, solutions and services outside of the u.s. and purchases important components, including final products, from suppliers located outside the u.s. shipments to non-u.s. customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales. we also expect to continue the use of third-party contract manufacturing services with non-u.s. production and assembly operations for our products.
risks associated with operations, sales, and purchases outside the united states include:
•fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales, increase costs of purchasing, and affect collection of receivables outside of the u.s.;
•volatility in foreign credit markets may affect the financial well-being of our customers and suppliers;
•violations of anti-corruption laws, including the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, could result in large fines and penalties;
•adverse changes in, or uncertainty of, local business laws or practices, including the following:
•imposition of burdensome tariffs, quotas, taxes, trade barriers, or capital flow restrictions;
•restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in, or purchase from, certain markets;
•political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our non-u.s. assets at risk;
•limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit recourse against infringement on our products or may cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories;
•staffing may be difficult including higher than anticipated turnover;
•a government-controlled exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of currencies, including the chinese yuan;
•transportation delays and customs related delays may affect production and distribution of our products;
•geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil could negatively affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers;
•effectively managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters; and
•integration and enforcement of laws varies significantly among jurisdictions and may change over time third parties may allege that the company or our suppliers infringe upon their intellectual property rights. periodically, third parties claim that we or our suppliers infringe upon their intellectual property rights. as we continue to expand our business and incorporate new technologies into our products and solutions, these types of claims may increase. any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel. to the extent a violation of a third party's patent or other intellectual property right is established, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and we may be required to pay costly judgments or settlements, enter into costly licensing arrangements or use a non-infringing method to accomplish our business objectives, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating margins.
the inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation, and our competitive position may be materially damaged. our intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages. we use copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and contracts to protect these proprietary rights. despite these precautions, third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of our intellectual property and our products or, without authorization, to misappropriate and use information we regard as trade secrets. additionally, the intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or infringed. in any infringement litigation that the company may undertake to protect our intellectual property, any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain, and any such award we may receive may not be commercially valuable. furthermore, efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of the company's confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies, software, and content developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all.
we currently use third-party and/or open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products and solutions. such parties ceasing continued development of the operating systems or restricting our access to such operating systems could adversely impact our business and financial results. we are dependent on third-parties' continued development of operating systems, software application ecosystem infrastructures, and such third-parties' approval of our implementations of their operating systems and associated applications. if such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems, we would be required to change our strategy for such devices. our financial results could be negatively impacted by a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult. a strategy shift could increase the burden of development on the company and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time, which could competitively disadvantage us.
cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations. we rely on information technology systems throughout the company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to distributors and customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, and other technical activities, and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications, and email. like many companies, we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business. we periodically perform vulnerability assessments, remediate vulnerabilities, review log/access, perform system maintenance, manage network perimeter protection, implement and manage disaster recovery testing, and provide periodic educational sessions to our employees to foster awareness of schemes to access sensitive information. despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent a cybersecurity incident. a cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. phishing and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat.
a cybersecurity incident, including deliberate attacks and unintentional events, may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems, the loss or corruption of confidential business information, and/or the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to our brand. this could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence.
while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents, there have been no material incidents incurred to-date at the company. if our core business operations, or that of one of our third-party service providers, were to be breached, this could affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data. any failure on the part of us or our third-party service providers to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings, and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our suppliers', distributors', and customers' confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. while we continue to perform security due diligence, there is always the possibility of a significant breach.
our products and solutions that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached, which could result in damage to a customer's confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the customer's data and systems. it is possible that such a breach could result in delays in, or loss of market acceptance of, our products, solutions or services; diversion of our resources; injury to our reputation; increased service and warranty expenses; and payment of damages. to date, we have had no material incidents related to the security on our products or solutions. although we maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will cover the particular cyber incident at issue or that such coverage will be sufficient.
we may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects. we may be subject to product liability claims, which could include claims for property or economic damages or personal injury, in the event damages arise from our products as a result of actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects. such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in our own designed products, but also in components provided by third-party suppliers. we generally have insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and seek to limit such risk through product design, manufacturing quality control processes, product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers. however, due to the growing size of the company's installed product base and growing number of applications in which our products can be used, an actual or alleged design or manufacturing defect could result in product recalls, customer service costs or legal costs that could have material adverse effects on our financial results.
defects or errors in the company's software products could harm our reputation, result in significant cost to us, and impair our ability to market such products. our software may contain undetected errors, defects, or bugs. although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors, defects, or bugs to date, we may discover significant errors, defects, or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner. any future errors, defects, or bugs found in our software products and related services may result in delays in, or loss of market acceptance of, our products, solutions or services; diversion of resources; injury to reputation; increased service and warranty expenses; and payment of damages.
we depend on the ongoing services of our senior management and the ability to attract and retain key personnel. the future success of the company is substantially dependent on the continued services and contributions of senior management and other key personnel. the ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees is important to our long-term success. competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain key employees or attract, assimilate, or retain other highly qualified employees in the future. any disruption in the services of senior management or our ability to attract and retain key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
a natural disaster, widespread public health issue, civil unrest, or man-made disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. natural disasters or widespread public health issues, including pandemics, may occur in the future and the company is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations. the company's operations and facilities are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters. if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. following an interruption to our business, the company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. if such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. the consequences of a natural disaster or widespread public health issue may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
the effects of the covid-19 pandemic have and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial results, and results of operations. the coronavirus ("covid-19") has spread rapidly worldwide, resulting in a broad number of governmental and commercial efforts to contain the spread of covid-19 globally, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. the covid-19 pandemic has been, and continues to be, complex and rapidly evolving, and has adversely impacted our business, primarily related to lower customer demand and higher fulfillment costs. the duration and extent of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results depends on factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of covid-19, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the extent to which vaccines and/or other medical treatments are developed and made available to the public, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, industry partners, suppliers and third party dealers, distributors, and resellers.
the federal, state, and local governments as well as foreign governments, to varying degrees, have imposed, and continue to impose, several protocols and regulations restricting the physical movement or other activities of individuals in an effort to limit the spread of covid-19. we have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers and suppliers, including having the majority of office workers work remotely, limiting employee travel, and withdrawing from industry events. the transition to working remotely for most of our office employees may impact our business operations, customer relationships, pose additional data security risks as well as impact our ability to attract and retain talent. the extent and duration of ongoing workplace restrictions and limitations, particularly in sites with significant headcount, could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute on strategic imperatives for our business. as governments ease their restrictions and we allow our employees to come back to work in our offices in a controlled approach, we have modified our business practices, including implementing social distancing protocols, office capacity restrictions, health screening, provision of personal protective equipment, tracking and tracing protocols, and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces. however, there is no guarantee that such protocols will be successful in preventing the spread of covid-19 amongst our employees. in late 2020, certain vaccines were authorized by major regulatory bodies to help fight the infection of covid-19, and certain other vaccines are in the late stages of development to provide such treatment. at this time, the availability of authorized vaccines is highly limited, and the time required to make these vaccines available to all members of the public remains uncertain. further, we have experienced higher than normal employee absentee rates for employees who are unable to work from home, and even as employees return to our offices, we may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time. the potential negative effects to our operations, including reductions in production levels, research and development activities, and increased costs resulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact of covid-19, may adversely affect our ability to deliver our products, solutions and services.
in addition, the continued spread of covid-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the worldwide credit and financial markets, which could limit our ability to obtain external financing and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults, adversely affecting our liquidity. while the covid-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, the duration and severity of any further economic or market impact of the pandemic remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to access capital markets, in the future.
if covid-19 becomes more prevalent in the locations where our customers, suppliers, or we conduct business, we may experience more pronounced disruptions in our operations. if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business and results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected. moreover, the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic may exacerbate other pre-existing risks, such as global economic conditions, political, regulatory, social, financial, operational and cybersecurity as well as similar risks relating to our suppliers and customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
zebra could be adversely impacted by the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union. zebra maintains its european regional headquarters and a label converting facility in the u.k. and has significant operations and sales throughout europe, including its regional distribution center located in heerenveen, netherlands. following the u.k. formally withdrawing from the e.u. on january 31, 2020, the u.k. and e.u. entered into a transition period that ended on december 31, 2020. the e.u.-u.k. trade and cooperation agreement was entered into on december 24, 2020 and details the future relationship between the u.k. and e.u., and has resolved much uncertainty. nevertheless, effective january 1, 2021, customs borders are in place between great britain and northern ireland and great britain and the e.u., which could adversely impact zebra's operations and financial performance due to the increase in importation requirements that may lead to disrupted or delayed shipments in the region. such disrupted or delayed shipments may also result in shortages of products and components or loss of customer confidence, which could affect zebra's financial performance.
we are exposed to risks under large, multi-year system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact our business. we enter into large, multi-year system and solutions and services contracts with our customers that expose us to risks, including among others: (i) technological risks, especially when contracts involve new technology; (ii) financial risks, including the accuracy of estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large, long-term contracts and the related impact on operating results; and (iii) cybersecurity risks, especially in solutions or managed services contracts with customers that process personal data. recovery of front-loaded costs incurred on long-term managed services and software-based solutions contracts with customers is dependent on the continued viability of such customers. the insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
we enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs. if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and require the company to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with our subcontractors or suppliers, and other cost overruns, can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results. in addition, a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longer-term contracts.
we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts, and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact our performance obligations as the prime contractor. we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and our use of subcontractors has and may continue to increase as we expand our global solutions and services business. our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply third-party products and software. we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by a subcontractor and the functionality, warranty and indemnities of products, software, and services supplied by a subcontractor. we are not always successful in passing along customer requirements to our subcontractors, and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding back-to-back coverage from our subcontractors. our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials, components, subsystems, and services they supply, or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers, which might result in greater product returns, service problems, warranty claims and costs, and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair, distribution, engineering services, and information technology services and may outsource additional business operations, which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners. we are not able to directly control certain business operations that we outsource. our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service, cost reductions, or other metrics. in some cases, our outsource partners' actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations, such as import or export regulations. as many of our outsource partners operate outside of the u.s., our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks. in addition, we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners. once a business activity is outsourced, we may be contractually prohibited from, or may not practically be able to, bring such activity back within the company or move it to another outsource partner. the actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results. additionally, transitioning activities between new or existing outsource partners or across different geographies as well as insourcing activities could result in additional cost, time and management attention in order to effectively manage the transition, which could negatively impact our financial results.
failure of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business. it is our policy to require suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, and third-party sales representatives ("tpsrs") to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including those regarding working conditions, employment practices, environmental compliance, anti-corruption, and trademark and copyright licensing. however, we do not control their labor and other business practices. if one of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, or tpsrs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be canceled, relationships could be terminated, and our reputation could be damaged. if one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks, copyrights, or patents, legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of the company's products and solutions, and expose us to financial obligations to a third-party. any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations.
we rely on third-party dealers, distributors, and resellers to sell many of our products and solutions, and their failure to effectively bring our products and solutions to market may negatively affect our results of operation and financial results. in addition to our own sales force, we offer our products and solutions through a variety of third-party dealers, distributors, and resellers who may also market other products and solutions that compete with ours. failure of one or more of our third-party dealers, distributors, or resellers to effectively promote our products and solutions could affect our ability to bring products and solutions to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations. any changes to our channel program may cause some of our third-party dealers, distributors, or resellers to exit the program due to modifications to the program structure, which may reduce our ability to bring products and solutions to market and could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
some of these third-parties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets. if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for third-party dealers, distributors, or resellers and we are unable to successfully transition end-customers to purchase our products and solutions from other third-parties or from us directly, it may cause, and in some cases, has caused, a negative impact on our financial results.
final assembly of certain of our products is performed by third-party electronics manufacturers. we may be dependent on these third-party electronics manufacturers as a sole-source of supply for the manufacture of such products. a failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us as we require, or any disruption in such manufacturing services up to and including a catastrophic shut-down, may adversely affect our business results. because we rely on these third-party electronics manufacturers to manufacture our products, we may incur increased business continuity risks. we are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products. if these third-party manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs, then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands, lose sales, and be unable to maintain customer relationships. longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand. without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products, we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility. this transition could be costly and time consuming. from time to time we may diversify our product sourcing footprint, similar to the actions we took with our efforts to reduce our reliance on chinese-based manufacturing, which may result in additional costs.
our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and components, as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers. we source some of our components from sole source suppliers. any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. our ability to meet customers' demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate delivery of quality materials, parts, and components, as well as services and software from our suppliers. in addition, certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner. if demand for our products, solutions or services increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our demand for other reasons, including as a result of natural disasters, public health issues, severe weather conditions, or financial issues, we could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on our business. we have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future. credit constraints at our suppliers could cause us to accelerate payment of accounts payable by us, impacting our cash flow.
in addition, our current contracts with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and, therefore, not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies. moreover, in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with us, our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages it may suffer.
financial and market risks the impact of changes in customs duties and trade policies in the united states and corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect our financial performance. the company currently imports a significant percentage of our products into the u.s., and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the company's financial performance. during 2020, the company successfully completed efforts to diversify its product sourcing footprint in order to reduce its reliance on chinese-based manufacturing and mitigate the impacts of related customs duties.
taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves. we are subject to, and may become subject to, ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. as a result, we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters. in addition, we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations. such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the company's effective tax rate and cash flows. future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, foreign rate differential, future income tax expense, and cash flows.
forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates. forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex, subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates, as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules, the results of examinations by various tax authorities, and the impact of any acquisition, business combination, disposition or other reorganization, or financing transaction.
as a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, tax laws and regulations, as well as multinational tax conventions. many countries have recently adopted, or are considering the adoption of, revisions to their respective tax laws based on the on-going reports issued by the organization for economic co-operation and development ("oecd")/g20 base erosion and profit shifting ("beps") project, which could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations outside of the u.s. our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model, the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region, and the availability of tax credits and carry-forwards. the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty. tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings. consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and/or our effective income tax rate.
economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations. adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may negatively impact our business. general disruption of financial markets and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products, solutions or services by our customers. if a slowdown were severe enough, it could require further impairment testing and write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets. cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges. a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers, suppliers, outsourced manufacturers, and channel partners (e.g., distributors and resellers) from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases. an economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products, solutions and services; negatively impacting the ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis; result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable; and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence. higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the u.s. dollar against currencies such as the euro, british pound sterling, czech koruna, brazilian real, and chinese yuan could negatively impact product sales, margins, and cash flows.
it is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance or exhaust our coverage, we may be forced to retain the risk. we have many types of insurance coverage and are also self-insured for some risks and obligations. our third-party insurance coverage varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. in addition, our third-party insurance policies are subject to deductibles, policy limits, and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. further, certain types of coverages may be difficult or expensive to obtain. we self-insure against certain business risks and expenses where we believe we can adequately self-insure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed cost-effective or is not available. if the amount of our third-party insurance coverage is not available or adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident, incident, or claim. losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our indebtedness could adversely affect our business. as of december 31, 2020, we had $1.3 billion of outstanding debt, gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:
•we may experience difficulty in satisfying our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness or future indebtedness;
•our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes may be impaired;
•we may be at a competitive disadvantage with reduced flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in the industry, including increased competition; and
•we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in the business.
we expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations. our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance and ability to collect cash from our customers, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors.
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. in addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. the terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. in addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and/or principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness.
our use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our operating results. we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. however, we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with our indebtedness. to manage variable interest rate risk, we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements, which will effectively convert a portion of our indebtedness into a fixed rate loan. under generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the fair values of the swap contracts are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of "other, net" if not hedged. the associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates. if interest rates increase, we would have a non-cash gain on the swaps, and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates. consequently, these swaps introduce additional volatility to our operating results.
legal and regulatory risks we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, business acquisition purchase price allocations, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, tax matters, and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. new accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or change our financial statements.
laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against the company. as part of our operations, the company collects, uses, stores, and transfers personal data of third parties, employees and limited customer data in and across various jurisdictions. laws and regulations relating to the handling of such personal data may result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against the company. existing laws and emerging regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. government officials, regulators and privacy advocates are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data, which may result in new interpretations of existing laws that impact our business. compliance with these laws may require us to, among other things, make changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that may result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. further, there is no assurance that we will be able to meet additional requirements that may be imposed on the transfer of personal data without incurring expenses. we may experience reluctance or refusal by customers to purchase or continue to use our services due to concerns regarding their data protection obligations. our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, may subject the company to enforcement actions and regulatory investigations, claims, legal proceedings or other actions, reputational harm and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business.
the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation, arbitration, or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. from time to time we are a party to litigation, arbitration, or administrative actions. our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions, including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, or other anti-corruption laws. there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings. in addition, it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results.
we are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety, and environmental laws. our operations and the products we manufacture and/or sell are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety, and environmental laws and regulations. compliance with such existing or future laws and regulations could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, restrict what products, solutions and services we can offer, and generally impact our financial performance. some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use, disposal, remediation, emission and discharge of, and exposure to hazardous substances. these laws often impose liability and can require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault. we continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations. environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time and any new obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our operations or financial performance.
laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories; recycling of both electronic products and packaging; reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products; and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly. laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products, standardization of connectors and power supplies, the transportation of lithium-ion batteries, and other aspects are also proliferating. there are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety, radio interference, radio frequency radiation exposure, medical related functionality, and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment. these laws, and changes to these laws, could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products, solutions, and services, and on what capabilities and characteristics our products, solutions or services can or must include.
these laws impact our products and negatively affect our ability to manufacture and sell products competitively. we expect these trends to continue. in addition, we anticipate that we will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products, increasing energy efficiency, and providing additional accessibility.

overview zebra technologies corporation and its subsidiaries ("zebra" or the "company") is a global leader respected for innovative enterprise asset intelligence ("eai") solutions in the automatic identification and data capture solutions industry. we design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products and solutions, including cloud-based subscriptions, that capture and move data, including: mobile computers; barcode scanners and imagers; radio frequency identification device ("rfid") readers; specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification; real-time location systems ("rtls"); related accessories and supplies, such as self-adhesive labels and other consumables; and software applications. we also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, and repair, managed and professional services. end-users of our products, solutions and services include those in the retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, government, education, and banking enterprises around the world.  we provide products, solutions, and services in approximately 180 countries, with 128 facilities and approximately 8,800 employees worldwide.
our customers have traditionally benefited from proven solutions that increase productivity and improve asset efficiency and utilization. the company is poised to drive, and capitalize on, the evolution of the data capture industry into the broader eai industry, based on important technology trends like the internet of things ("iot"), ubiquitous mobility, automation and cloud computing. eai solutions offer additional benefits to our customers including real-time, data-driven insights that improve operational visibility and drive workflow optimization.
the company's operations consist of two reportable segments: asset intelligence & tracking ("ait") and enterprise visibility & mobility ("evm").
•the ait segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. its major product lines include barcode and card printers, supplies, services, location solutions, and retail solutions. industries served include retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other end markets within the following regions: north america; europe, middle east, and africa ("emea"); asia-pacific; and latin america.
•the evm segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions. its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, rfid, services, and workflow optimization solutions. industries served include retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other end markets within the following regions: north america; emea; asia-pacific; and latin america.
beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we will move the retail solutions product line from our ait segment into our evm segment contemporaneous with a change in our organizational structure and management of the business. we will begin reporting our results reflecting this change in the first quarter of 2021 and will present historical periods on a comparable basis. the impact of this change does not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements and is immaterial to our current and historical reportable segment results.
recent developments covid-19 outbreak in 2020, the coronavirus ("covid-19") spread rapidly worldwide, resulting in a broad number of governmental and commercial efforts to contain it, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. these events have resulted in significant declines in global economic activity and significant volatility in financial market valuations, the duration and extent of which continues to be highly uncertain. the company's 2020 net sales and profitability were negatively impacted by the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic which were most pronounced in the second quarter.
we serve a diverse mix of customers. some of our customers have experienced significant declines or suspensions to their operations, whereas others have experienced increases in their business volume. while many of our supply chain partners in china temporarily suspended or modified their business operations in early 2020 as a consequence of covid-19, we have substantially mitigated the impact of these disruptions by taking exceptional actions, including alternative modes of product delivery and fulfillment, as well as providing protective equipment and hazard pay premiums for our front-line employees.
the federal, state, and local governments as well as foreign governments, to varying degrees, have imposed, and continue to impose, several protocols and regulations restricting the physical movement or other activities of individuals in an effort to limit the spread of covid-19. we have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect our employees' health and well-being, including having the majority of office workers work remotely, limiting employee travel, and withdrawing from in-person industry events. in addition, as governments continue to ease their restrictions and we continue to allow our employees to come back to work in our offices in a controlled approach, we have modified our business practices, including implementing social distancing protocols, office capacity restrictions, health screening, provision of personal protective equipment, tracking and tracing protocols, and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces. throughout the pandemic, distribution centers and repair centers have remained open at varying capacity levels to ensure continued support to our customers, many of whom provide essential goods and services to communities.
during the past year, we considered the potential impacts of the global pandemic in qualitative impairment assessments of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use lease assets. we concluded that it is not more likely than not that any of our long-lived assets are impaired. our analysis considered, among other factors:
•the nature of our products, solutions, and services as well as our position within our industry;
•our highly variable cost structure;
•the assumption that the negative impacts from covid-19 will be temporary; and that
•the company will continue generating strong positive operating cash flows over the long-term.
we have also considered the adequacy of our capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity and other financing facilities; the results of our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, which was last completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 and further discussed in note 6, goodwill and other intangibles in the notes to consolidated financial statements; and that our market capitalization has continued to far exceed total net assets. finally, while we may experience a temporary increase in working capital levels, we do not anticipate a material impact to the realizability of current assets, such as accounts receivable or inventories, at this time.
the situation related to the pandemic continues to be complex and rapidly evolving. in late 2020, certain vaccines were authorized by major regulatory bodies to help fight the infection of covid-19, and certain other vaccines are in the late stages of development to provide such treatment. at this time, however, the availability of authorized vaccines is highly limited, and the time required to make these vaccines available to all members of the public remains uncertain. if covid-19 persists or worsens before a safe and effective vaccine or other treatment is made widely available, there may be further external developments, such as restrictions imposed by government authorities or guidance issued by public health authorities, that are beyond our control and may impact our operating plans. parts of our business have experienced, and may continue to experience, operational disruption and customer demand impacts. since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken certain cost reduction actions to mitigate the impact to profitability and cash flow. we cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the pandemic or fully ascertain its long-term impact to our business.

2020 compared to 2019
total net sales decreased $37 million or 0.8% compared with the prior year primarily due to customer demand declines resulting from the covid-19 pandemic which had an overall negative effect on both of our segments and broadly across all regions. the negative effect of the pandemic was most pronounced within our ait segment, particularly in the second quarter of 2020. ait sales declines were partially offset by growth in our evm segment, reflecting higher services and software revenues, due in part from recent business acquisitions, as well as increased product purchases, particularly in the transportation and logistics and retail end markets, in response to the need to digitize and automate workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. excluding the effects of acquisitions and unfavorable currency changes, the decrease in consolidated organic net sales was 0.9%.
gross margin decreased to 45.0% for the current year compared to 46.8% in the prior year. gross margins were lower in both the ait and evm segments, reflecting unfavorable business mix, including larger deal size, and premium freight costs. these declines were partially offset by productivity gains within our services offerings and a partial recovery of 2019 chinese import tariffs in the fourth quarter of 2020.
operating expenses for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,352 million and $1,408 million, or 30.4% and 31.4% of net sales, respectively. as a percentage of net sales, operating costs continue to trend favorably. the decrease in operating expenses over the prior year was primarily due to lower discretionary spending, employee incentive-based compensation, and intangible asset amortization expense. these reductions were partially offset by the inclusion of operating expenses associated with acquired businesses and costs associated with the diversification of the company's product sourcing footprint.
operating income was $651 million for the current year compared to $692 million for the prior year. the decrease was primarily due to lower net sales and gross profit, partially offset by the benefit of lower operating expenses.
net income decreased 7.4% compared to the prior year due to lower operating income and higher income tax expense, which were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses, net, detailed as follows:
•the company's effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019 were 10.0% and 9.0%, respectively. the company's effective tax rate was higher in the current year as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher benefits of uncertain tax positions in the prior year, partially offset by higher income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates in the current year.
•other expenses, net was $91 million for the current year, compared to $94 million for the prior year. the increase in interest rate swap and foreign exchange losses in the current year were more than offset by the favorable impacts of lower interest rates and average outstanding debt levels. additionally, the prior year included $7 million of debt refinancing costs.
diluted earnings per share decreased to $9.35 as compared to $9.97 in the prior year primarily due to lower operating income and a higher effective income tax rate, which were partially offset by the benefit of lower weighted average shares outstanding.
results of operations by segment the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as detailed in note 20, segment information & geographic data in the notes to consolidated financial statements. to the extent applicable, segment results exclude purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, and product sourcing diversification costs.

the change in our cash and cash equivalents balance during the current year is reflective of the following:
•the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the favorable timing of collections from customers, favorable timing of vendor payments, as well as lower cash payments for employee incentive compensation, income taxes and interest. these benefits were partially offset by higher inventory levels.
•net cash used in investing activities included the company's acquisition of reflexis in the current year, which consisted of $548 million cash paid, net of cash acquired, as well as $32 million in cash paid for additional long-term investments. the prior year's cash used in investing activities included cash paid for the acquisitions of temptime, profitect and cortexica totaling $262 million, as well as $22 million in cash paid for long-term investments.
•net cash used in financing activities during the current year included common stock repurchases of $200 million, net debt repayments of $40 million and net payments related to share-based compensation plans of $25 million, partially offset by the favorable timing of unremitted cash collections from the servicing of factored receivables of $109 million. net cash used in financing activities during the prior year included to net debt repayments of $312 million, net payments related to share-based compensation plans of $32 million and common stock repurchases of $47 million.

(4)purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements, primarily raw materials and finished goods. purchase obligations included in the table above are based on quarterly forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for products. the company does not have contractual obligations related to take-or-pay arrangements.
uncertain tax positions of $8 million have been excluded from the table above because we cannot reliably estimate the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. see note 16, income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
critical accounting policies and estimates management prepared the consolidated financial statements of the company under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the application of these principles requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions which affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. we believe that our estimates, judgments, and assumptions are reasonable based upon available information. our more significant estimates and assumptions include those related to the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities, development of fair value estimates when measuring the identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, development of reporting unit fair values as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and measurement of variable consideration and allocation of transaction price to performance obligations in revenue transactions. see note 2, significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items as well as other accounting policies.

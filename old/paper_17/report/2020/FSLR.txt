summary of risk factors the following is a summary of the principal risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and make an investment in our stock speculative or risky. you should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.
risks related to our markets and customers
•competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense, and could remain that way for an extended period of time. an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand. if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time, or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
•pv solar and related technologies may not be suitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return. sufficient additional demand for solar modules, related technologies, and systems may not develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate, causing our net sales and profit to flatten or decline and threatening our ability to sustain profitability.
•the reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, renewable energy targets, and other support for on-grid solar electricity applications, or other public policies could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules and systems. the imposition of tariffs on our products could materially increase our costs to perform under our contracts with customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
•an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets (including a reduction in total tax equity availability) could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems and/or lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings.
risks related to our operations, manufacturing, and technology
•we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules; if global supply exceeds global demand, it could lead to a further reduction in the average selling price for pv solar modules, which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations.
•problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant and/or unexpected contractual damages and/or warranty and related expenses, damage our market reputation, and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share.
•our failure to further refine our technology, reduce module manufacturing and bos costs, and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales, profitability, and/or market share.
•several of our key raw materials components, particularly cdte, and manufacturing equipment are either single-sourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers, and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us.
risks related to our systems business
•project development or construction activities may not be successful; projects under development may not receive required permits, real property rights, ppas, interconnection, and transmission arrangements; or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled, which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments.
•we may be unable to acquire or lease land, obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights, and/or obtain the approvals, licenses, permits, and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv solar power systems in a timely and cost effective manner, and regulatory agencies, local communities, labor unions, tribes, or other third parties may delay, prevent, or increase the cost of construction and operation of the system we intend to build.
•we may not be able to obtain long-term contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments, adversely affecting our results of operations.
•lack of transmission capacity availability, potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid, and other system constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv solar power systems and generate solar electricity power sales.
risks related to regulations
•existing regulations and policies, changes thereto, and new regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv solar products or systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our modules, systems, or services.
risks related to the covid-19 pandemic
•the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic could impact us is highly uncertain and will depend largely on the severity and duration of the pandemic, measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, and policies implemented by governmental authorities to ease restrictions in a phased manner.
general risk factors
•if our long-lived assets or project related assets become impaired, we may be required to record significant charges to earnings.
•our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.
risks related to our markets and customers competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense, and could remain that way for an extended period of time. an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
in the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. for example, we estimate that in 2020 approximately 50 gwdc of capacity was added by solar module manufacturers, primarily but not exclusively in asia. we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will continue to put pressure on pricing. during the past several years, industry average selling prices per watt have declined in many markets, at times significantly, both at the module and system levels, as competitors have reduced prices to sell inventories worldwide. there may be additional pressure on global demand and average selling prices in the future resulting from fluctuating demand in certain major solar markets, such as china. if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time, or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
if pv solar and related technologies are not suitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules, related technologies, and systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability.
in comparison to traditional forms of energy generation, the solar energy market continues to be at a relatively early stage of development. if utility-scale pv solar technology proves unsuitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability. in addition, demand for solar modules, related technologies, and systems in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate. many factors may affect the viability of continued adoption of utility-scale pv solar technology in our targeted markets, as well as the demand for solar modules and systems generally, including the following:
•cost-effectiveness of the electricity generated by pv solar power systems compared to conventional energy sources, such as natural gas (which fuel source may be subject to significant price fluctuations from time to time), and other renewable energy sources, such as wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric;
•changes in tax, trade remedies, and other public policy, as well as changes in economic, market, and other conditions that affect the price of, and demand for, conventional energy resources, non-solar renewable energy resources (e.g., wind and hydroelectric), and energy efficiency programs and products, including increases or decreases in the prices of natural gas, coal, oil, and other fossil fuels and in the prices of competing renewable resources;
•the extent of competition, barriers to entry, and overall conditions and timing related to the development of solar in new and emerging market segments such as commercial and industrial customers, community solar, community choice aggregators, and other customer segments;
•availability, substance, and magnitude of support programs including federal, state, and local government subsidies, incentives, targets, and renewable portfolio standards, among other policies and programs, to accelerate the development of the solar industry;
•performance, reliability, and availability of energy generated by pv solar power systems compared to conventional and other non-solar renewable energy sources and products, particularly conventional energy generation capable of providing 24-hour, non-intermittent baseload power;
•the development, functionality, scale, cost, and timing of energy storage solutions; and
•changes in the amount and priorities of capital expenditures by end users of solar modules and systems (e.g., utilities), which capital expenditures tend to decrease when the economy slows or when interest rates increase, thereby resulting in redirection away from solar generation to development of competing forms of electric generation and to distribution (e.g., smart grid), transmission, and energy efficiency measures.
the reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, renewable energy targets, and other support for on-grid solar electricity applications, or other public policies, such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules, could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results.
although we believe that solar energy will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy without any support programs, in certain markets our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives. federal, state, and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits, rebates, tax incentives, and other incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators, and manufacturers of pv solar products. many of these support programs expire, phase out over time, require renewal by the applicable authority, or may be amended. a summary of certain recent developments in the major government support programs that may impact our business appears under item 1. "business - support programs." to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected or are changed retroactively, such changes could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules and systems, lead to a reduction in our net sales, and adversely impact our operating results. another consideration in the u.s. market, and to a lesser extent in other global markets, is the effect of governmental land-use planning policies and environmental policies on utility-scale pv solar development. the adoption of restrictive land-use designations or environmental regulations that proscribe or restrict the siting of utility-scale solar facilities could adversely affect the marginal cost of such development.
changes or threatened changes in u.s. regulatory policy may subject us to significant risks, including the following:
•a reduction or removal of clean energy programs and initiatives and the incentives they provide may diminish the market for future solar energy off-take agreements, slow the retirement of aging fossil fuel plants, including the retirements of coal generation plants, and reduce the ability for solar project developers to compete for off-take agreements, which may reduce pv solar module sales;
•any limitations on the value or availability to potential investors of tax incentives that benefit solar energy projects such as the itc and accelerated depreciation deductions could result in reducing such investors' economic returns, causing a reduction in the availability of affordable financing, thereby reducing demand for pv solar modules; and
•any effort to overturn federal and state laws, regulations, or policies that are supportive of solar energy generation or that remove costs or other limitations on other types of electricity generation that compete with solar energy projects could negatively impact our ability to compete with traditional forms of electricity generation and materially and adversely affect our business.
application of u.s. trade laws, or trade laws of other countries, may also impact, either directly or indirectly, our operating results. in some instances, the application of trade laws is currently beneficial to the company, and changes in their application could have an adverse impact.
for example, the united states currently imposes different types of tariffs and/or other trade remedies on certain imported crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and cells from various countries. these tariffs include a global safeguard measure imposed pursuant to section 201 of the trade act of 1974 that provides for tariffs on imported crystalline silicon solar modules and a tariff-rate quota on imported crystalline silicon solar cells. between february 2021 and february 2022, the tariff rate is 18% for imported crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and imported crystalline silicon solar cells above the tariff rate quota. thin film solar cell products, such as our cdte technology, are specifically excluded from the tariffs. the positive impact of this measure on our operating results was reduced by a tariff exclusion for imports of bifacial modules that the u.s. trade representative granted in june 2019 and that the u.s. president withdrew in october 2020. further changes to the measure, including as a result of pending litigation challenging the withdrawal of the exclusion, could further impact our operating results. in addition, the united states currently imposes antidumping and countervailing duties on certain imported crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules from china and taiwan. such antidumping and countervailing duties can change over time pursuant to annual reviews conducted by the u.s. department of commerce, and a decline in duty rates could have an adverse impact on our operating results.
in other instances, the application of u.s. trade laws has had, or could have, an adverse impact on our operating results by increasing our costs or limiting the competitiveness of our products. examples include tariffs the united states imposes on certain imported aluminum and steel articles, generally at rates of 10% and 25%, respectively, under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962; and potential tariffs on imports of goods from vietnam under section 301 of the tariff act of 1974. if such tariffs are imposed on solar modules imported from vietnam, it could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
internationally, in july 2018, the indian government imposed a safeguard measure on solar cells and modules imported from various countries, including member countries of the organisation for economic co-operation and development ("oecd"), china, and malaysia, for a two-year period, starting at 25% through july 2019 and declining by five percentage points in each subsequent six-month period. in july 2020, the indian government announced an extension to the safeguard duty regime at a revised rate of 14.9% through december 2020 and declining to 14.5% through july 2021. these duties are applicable to imports from member countries of the oecd, china, vietnam, and thailand, but imports from malaysia have been exempted from the revised safeguard measures.
such tariffs and policies, or any other u.s. or global trade remedies or other trade barriers, may directly or indirectly affect u.s. or global markets for solar energy and our business, financial condition, and results of operations. these examples show that established markets for pv solar development face uncertainties arising from policy, regulatory, and governmental constraints. while the expected potential of the markets we are targeting is significant, policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia, political instability, the imposition or lowering of trade remedies and other trade barriers, geopolitical risk, fossil fuel subsidization, potentially stringent localization requirements, and limited available infrastructure.
an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets (including a reduction in total tax equity availability) could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems and/or lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings.
many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt and/or equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop, build, and/or purchase a pv solar power system. as a result, an increase in interest rates, or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments, could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop, build, purchase, or install a pv solar power system on favorable terms, or at all, and thus lower demand for our solar modules, which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales. see the risk factor entitled "the reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, renewable energy targets, and other support for on-grid solar electricity applications, or other public policies, such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules, could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results" for additional information. in addition, we believe that a significant percentage of our customers install systems as an investment, funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt. an increase in interest rates could lower an investor's return on investment in a system, increase equity return requirements, or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems and, in each case, could cause these customers to seek alternative investments.
we may be unable to fully execute on our long-term strategic plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
we face numerous difficulties in executing on our long-term strategic plans, particularly in new foreign jurisdictions, including the following:
•difficulty in competing against companies who may have greater financial resources and/or a more effective or established localized business presence and/or an ability to operate with minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time;
•difficulty in competing successfully with other technologies, such as bifacial modules and n-type mono-crystalline wafers and cells;
•difficulty in accurately prioritizing geographic markets that we can most effectively and profitably serve with our pv solar offerings, including miscalculations in overestimating or underestimating addressable market demand;
•adverse public policies in countries we operate in and/or are pursuing, including local content requirements, the imposition of trade remedies, or capital investment requirements;
•business climates, such as that in china, that may have the effect of putting foreign companies at a disadvantage relative to domestic companies;
•unstable economic, social, and/or operating environments in foreign jurisdictions, including social unrest, currency, inflation, and interest rate uncertainties;
•the possibility of applying an ineffective commercial approach to targeted markets, including product offerings that may not meet market needs;
•difficulty in generating sufficient sales volumes at economically sustainable profitability levels;
•difficulty in timely identifying, attracting, training, and retaining qualified sales, technical, and other personnel in geographies targeted for expansion;
•difficulty in maintaining proper controls and procedures as we expand our business operations in terms of geographical reach, including transitioning certain business functions to low-cost geographies, with any material control failure potentially leading to reputational damage and loss of confidence in our financial reporting;
•difficulty in competing successfully for market share in overall solar markets as a result of the success of companies participating in the global rooftop pv solar market, which is a segment in which we do not have significant historical experience;
•difficulty in establishing and implementing a commercial and operational approach adequate to address the specific needs of the markets we are pursuing;
•difficulty in identifying effective local partners and developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses on commercially acceptable terms;
•difficulty in balancing market demand and manufacturing production in an efficient and timely manner, potentially causing our manufacturing capacity to be constrained in some future periods or over-supplied in others; and
•difficulty in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to consummate the sale of our u.s. project development business.
refer also to the risk factors entitled "our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks, including unfavorable political, regulatory, labor, and tax conditions in the united states and/or foreign countries," and "the reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, renewable energy targets, and other support for on-grid solar electricity applications, or other public policies, such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules, could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs, thereby adversely impacting our operating results."
the loss of any of our large customers, or the inability of our customers and counterparties to perform under their contracts with us, could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our results of operations.
our customers include integrators and operators of systems, utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners, who may experience intense competition at the system level, thereby constraining the ability for such customers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. the loss of any of our large customers, their inability to perform under their contracts, or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales and/or adversely impact our operating results. while our contracts with customers typically have certain firm purchase commitments and may include provisions for the payment of amounts to us in certain events of contract termination, these contracts may be subject to amendments made by us or requested by our customers. these amendments may reduce the volume of modules to be sold under the contract, adjust delivery schedules, or otherwise decrease the expected revenue under these contracts. although we believe that we can mitigate this risk, in part, by reallocating modules to other customers if the need arises, we may be unable, in whole or in part, to do so on similar terms or at all. we may also mitigate this risk by requiring some form of payment security from our customers, such as parent guarantees, bank guarantees, surety bonds, or commercial letters of credit. however, in the event the providers of such payment security fail to perform their obligations, our operating results could be adversely impacted.
we may be unable to profitably provide new solar offerings or achieve sufficient market penetration with such offerings.
we may expand our portfolio of offerings to include solutions that build upon our core competencies but for which we have not had significant historical experience, including variations in our traditional product offerings or other offerings related to commercial and industrial customers and community solar. we cannot be certain that we will be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary to grow these business areas. we could invest capital into growing these businesses but fail to address market or customer needs or otherwise not experience a satisfactory level of financial return. also, in expanding into these areas, we may be competing against companies that previously have not been significant competitors, such as companies that currently have substantially more experience than we do in the residential, commercial and industrial, or other targeted offerings. if we are unable to achieve growth in these areas, our overall growth and financial performance may be limited relative to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted.
risks related to our operations, manufacturing, and technology we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules; if global supply exceeds global demand, it could lead to a further reduction in the average selling price for pv solar modules, which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations.
the solar and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and are continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry. within the global pv solar industry, we face intense competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers. existing or future solar module manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources, thereby further intensifying competition with us. in addition, the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete, which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations.
even if demand for solar modules continues to grow, the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many module manufacturers in china and certain parts of southeast asia, particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon cells, modules, and wafers, has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance in which supply exceeds demand. see the risk factor entitled "competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense, and could remain that way for an extended period of time. an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations," for additional information. in addition, we believe any significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock or polysilicon would reduce the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially an oversupply of solar modules. we also believe many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers have substantially transitioned from lower efficiency bsf multi-crystalline cells (the legacy technology against which we have generally competed in our markets) to higher efficiency perc mono-crystalline cells at competitive cost structures. as a result, we expect that in the near future, our primary competition will be mono-crystalline perc based modules with higher conversion efficiencies. additionally, while conventional solar modules, including the solar modules we produce, are monofacial, meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side, certain manufacturers of mono-crystalline perc solar modules offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module. such technology can improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate front-side efficiency when applied in certain applications and bos configurations, which could potentially lower the overall levelized cost of electricity ("lcoe"), meaning the net present value of a system's total life cycle costs divided by the quantity of energy that is expected to be produced over the system's life, of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules, including the modules we produce. additionally, we believe that our competitors are evaluating the possibility of transitioning from p-type to n-type mono-crystalline wafers and cells. if successful, such transition would further increase the efficiency and energy yield of their product. finally, many of our competitors are promoting modules with larger overall area based on the use of larger silicon wafers. while the transition to such larger wafers would increase nameplate wattage, we believe the associated production cost would not improve significantly.
during any such period, our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition, even below their manufacturing costs, in order to generate sales, and may do so for a sustained period. other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital, which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time. as a result, we may be unable to sell our solar modules or systems at attractive prices, or for a profit, during any period of excess supply of solar modules, which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, we may decide to lower our average selling prices to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition, which could also reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations.
problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant and/or unexpected contractual damages and/or warranty and related expenses, damage our market reputation, and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share.
we perform a variety of module quality and life tests under different environmental conditions upon which we base our assessments of future module performance over the duration of the warranty. however, if our thin film solar modules perform below expectations, we could experience significant warranty and related expenses, damage to our market reputation, and erosion of our market share. with respect to our modules, we provide a limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12 years. we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years. among other things, our solar module warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking. as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty, we have also offered an aggregated or system-level limited module performance warranty. this system-level limited module performance warranty is designed for utility-scale systems and provides 25-year system-level energy degradation protection. this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying, from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility-scale system, individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules. the system-level limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system's expected energy production, adjusted for certain actual site conditions, with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion, but never falling below 80% during the term of the warranty. as a result of these warranty programs, we bear the risk of product warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales.
if any of the assumptions used in estimating our module warranties prove incorrect, we could be required to accrue additional expenses, which could adversely impact our financial position, operating results, and cash flows. although we have taken significant precautions to avoid a manufacturing excursion from occurring, any manufacturing excursions, including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond the stated remedies in our warranties, could adversely impact our reputation, financial position, operating results, and cash flows.
although our module performance warranties extend for up to 30 years, our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001. accordingly, our warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance. these predictions, however, could prove to be materially different from the actual performance during the warranty period, causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules or provide financial remuneration in the future. for example, our solar modules could suffer various failure modes, including breakage, delamination, corrosion, or performance degradation in excess of expectations, and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to materials or process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations. these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our products and accelerate module wattage as part of our long-term strategic plans. in addition, if we increase the number of installations in extreme climates, we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such field conditions. any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation, cause our net sales to decline, require us to repair or replace the defective modules or provide financial remuneration, and result in us taking voluntary remedial measures beyond those required by our standard warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
in resolving claims under both the limited defect and power output warranties, we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or, under the limited power output warranty, providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall or making certain cash payments; however, historical versions of our module warranty did not provide a refund remedy. consequently, we may be obligated to repair or replace the covered modules under such historical programs. as our manufacturing process may change from time-to-time in accordance with our technology roadmap, we may elect to stop production of older versions of our modules that would constitute compatible replacement modules. in some jurisdictions, our inability to provide compatible replacement modules could potentially expose us to liabilities beyond the limitations of our module warranties, which could adversely impact our reputation, financial position, operating results, and cash flows.
for pv solar power systems constructed for customers, we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design, installation, and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system. in resolving claims under such bos warranties, we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement. as with our modules, these warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance. any failures in bos equipment or system construction beyond our expectations may also adversely impact our reputation, financial position, operating results, and cash flows.
in addition, our contracts with customers may include provisions with particular product specifications, minimum wattage requirements, and specified delivery schedules. these contracts may be terminated, or we may incur significant liquidated damages or other damages, if we fail to perform our contractual obligations. in addition, our costs to perform under these contracts may exceed our estimates, which could adversely impact our profitability. any failures to comply with our contracts for the sale of our modules could adversely impact our reputation, financial position, operating results, and cash flows.
our failure to further refine our technology, reduce module manufacturing and bos costs, and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales, profitability, and/or market share.
we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in r&d to continue to improve our module conversion efficiencies, lower the lcoe of our pv solar power systems, and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry. however, r&d activities are inherently uncertain, and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results. we seek to continuously improve our products and processes, including, for example, certain planned improvements to our series 6 module technology and manufacturing capabilities, such as the implementation of our copper replacement (or "cure") program or the increase to our module form factor (which we refer to as "series 6 plus"), and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays, performance, additional costs, or other unintended contingencies. in addition, our significant expenditures for r&d may not produce corresponding benefits. other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies, including advanced multi-crystalline silicon cells, perc or advanced p-type crystalline silicon cells, high-efficiency n-type crystalline silicon cells, bifacial solar modules, copper indium gallium diselenide thin films, amorphous silicon thin films, and new emerging technologies such as hybrid perovskites, which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more cost-effective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems.
in addition, other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power generation drawback of many renewable energy systems, or offer other value-added improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners, in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new systems is higher than that of our systems. as a result, our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors, which would reduce our net sales, profitability, and/or market share. in addition, we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements, and thus, an inability to further refine our technology and execute our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps could adversely affect our operating results.
some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced. if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts, we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements.
some of our manufacturing equipment, including manufacturing equipment related to the production of our series 6 modules, is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to equipment manufacturers, which then undertake a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment. as a result, the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become delayed, damaged, or stop working. if any piece of equipment fails, production along the entire production line could be interrupted. in addition, the failure of our equipment manufacturers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion or conversion plans, otherwise disrupt our production schedule, and/or increase our manufacturing costs, all of which would adversely impact our operating results.
several of our key raw materials and components are either single-sourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers, and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us.
our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality, quantity, and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs. several of our key raw materials and components are either single-sourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers. as a result, the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and adversely impact our operations. in addition, some of our suppliers are smaller companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we expand our business. we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms. a constraint on our production may result in our inability to meet our capacity plans and/or our obligations under our customer contracts, which would have an adverse impact on our business. additionally, reductions in our production volume may put pressure on suppliers, resulting in increased material and component costs.
a disruption in our supply chain for cdte could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and long-term growth prospects.
a key raw material used in our module production process is a cdte compound. tellurium, one of the main components of cdte, is mainly produced as a by-product of copper refining, and therefore, its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper. our supply of cdte could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers fail to perform or are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices. if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium, they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts. furthermore, if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for tellurium, our requirements for tellurium increase, new applications for tellurium become available, or adverse trade laws or policies restrict our ability to obtain tellurium from foreign vendors or make doing so cost prohibitive, the supply of tellurium and related cdte compounds could be reduced and prices could increase. as we may be unable to pass such increases in the costs of our raw materials through to our customers, a substantial increase in tellurium prices or any limitations in the supply of tellurium could adversely impact our profitability and long-term growth objectives.
our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand, convert existing production facilities to support new product lines, decrease our cost per watt, and, when necessary, continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to market demand, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties.
our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand, convert existing production facilities to support new product lines, decrease our cost per watt, and increase our manufacturing capacity in a cost-effective and efficient manner. if we cannot do so, we may be unable to decrease our cost per watt, maintain our competitive position, sustain profitability, expand our business, or create long-term shareholder value. our ability to decrease our cost per watt, expand production capacity, or convert existing production facilities to support new product lines is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the following:
•failure to reduce manufacturing material, labor, or overhead costs;
•an inability to increase production throughput or the average power output per module;
•failure to effectively manage logistics costs associated with the shipping, handling, storage, and distribution of our modules;
•delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which may be beyond our control, such as our inability to secure successful contracts with equipment vendors;
•our custom-built equipment taking longer and costing more to manufacture than expected and not operating as designed;
•delays or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities;
•an inability to hire qualified staff;
•failure to execute our expansion or conversion plans effectively;
•difficulty in balancing market demand and manufacturing production in an efficient and timely manner, potentially causing our manufacturing capacity to be constrained in some future periods or over-supplied in others; and
•incurring manufacturing asset write-downs, write-offs, and other charges and costs, which may be significant, during those periods in which we idle, slow down, shut down, convert, or otherwise adjust our manufacturing capacity.
if our estimates regarding the future costs of collecting and recycling cdte solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program are incorrect, we could be required to accrue additional expenses and face a significant unplanned cash burden.
as necessary, we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules, estimated rates of return on our restricted marketable securities, and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years. we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials; the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center; material, labor, and capital costs; and by-product credits for certain materials recovered during the recycling process. we base these estimates on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules and certain assumptions regarding costs at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. if our estimates prove incorrect, we could be required to accrue additional expenses and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or end users return their modules, which could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, participating end users can return their modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time. as a result, we could be required to collect and recycle covered cdte solar modules earlier than we expect.
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.
protection of our proprietary processes, methods, and other technology is critical to our business. failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies. we rely primarily on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. we regularly file patent applications to protect certain inventions arising from our r&d and are currently pursuing such patent applications in various countries in accordance with our strategy for intellectual property in that jurisdiction. our existing patents and future patents could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or rendered unenforceable. our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, or if patents are issued to us, such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies.
we also rely on unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation, and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property, such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise. adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. in addition, others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means. the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, equipment, technology, trade secrets, and proprietary manufacturing expertise, methods, and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations. in some countries, we have not applied for patent, trademark, or copyright protection.
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. additionally, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. we cannot ensure that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor, and such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business. an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, prospects, and reputation. in addition, we have no insurance coverage against such litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties.
if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules, it may adversely affect our future growth plans. if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines, our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers.
if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines over time and achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines, our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained, our manufacturing costs per watt could increase, and our growth could be limited. such factors may result in lower net sales and lower net income than we anticipate. for instance, future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies, higher failure rates, and/or higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines, and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance.
our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks, including unfavorable political, regulatory, labor, and tax conditions in the united states and/or foreign countries.
we have significant manufacturing, development, sales, and marketing operations both within and outside the united states and expect to continue to expand our operations worldwide. as a result, we are subject to the legal, political, social, tax, and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions.
risks inherent to international operations include, but are not limited to, the following:
•difficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems;
•varying degrees of protection afforded to foreign investments in the countries in which we operate and irregular interpretations and enforcement of laws and regulations in such jurisdictions;
•foreign countries may impose additional income and withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign operations, impose tariffs, or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade and investment, including currency exchange controls;
•fluctuations in exchange rates may affect demand for our products and services and may adversely affect our profitability and cash flows in u.s. dollars to the extent that our net sales or our costs are denominated in a foreign currency and the cost associated with hedging the u.s. dollar equivalent of such exposures is prohibitive; the longer the duration of such foreign currency exposure, the greater the risk;
•anti-corruption compliance issues, including the costs related to the mitigation of such risk;
•risk of nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises;
•changes in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate, including changes in government incentive provisions;
•unexpected adverse changes in u.s. or foreign laws or regulatory requirements, including those with respect to environmental protection, import or export duties, and quotas;
•opaque approval processes in which the lack of transparency may cause delays and increase the uncertainty of project approvals;
•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;
•difficulty in repatriating earnings;
•difficulty in negotiating a successful collective bargaining agreement in applicable foreign jurisdictions;
•trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes, local content requirements, anti-dumping regulations and requirements, and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the effective price of our solar modules and make us less competitive in some countries or increase the costs to perform under our existing contracts; and
•difficulty of, and costs relating to, compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas countries in which we offer and sell our solar modules.
our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries. our overall success as a global business depends, in part, on our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social, and political conditions. we may not be able to timely develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business.
risks related to our systems business project development or construction activities may not be successful; projects under development may not receive required permits, real property rights, ppas, interconnection, and transmission arrangements; or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled, which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments.
the development and construction of solar energy generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks. we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights, preliminary engineering, permitting, legal services, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built. success in developing a particular project is contingent upon, among other things:
•obtaining financeable land rights, including land rights for the project site, transmission lines, and environmental mitigation;
•entering into financeable arrangements for the purchase of the electrical output, capacity, ancillary services, and renewable energy attributes generated by the project;
•receipt from governmental agencies of required environmental, land-use, and construction and operation permits and approvals;
•receipt of tribal government approvals for projects on tribal land;
•receipt of governmental approvals related to the presence of any protected or endangered species or habitats, migratory birds, wetlands or other jurisdictional water resources, and/or cultural resources;
•negotiation of development agreements, public benefit agreements, and other agreements to compensate local governments for project impacts;
•negotiation of state and local tax abatement and incentive agreements;
•receipt of rights to interconnect the project to the electric grid or to transmit energy;
•negotiation of satisfactory epc agreements, including agreements with third-party epc providers;
•securing necessary rights of way for access and transmission lines;
•securing necessary water rights for project construction and operation;
•securing appropriate title coverage, including coverage for mineral rights, mechanics' liens, etc.;
•obtaining financing, including debt, equity, and funds associated with the monetization of tax credits and other tax benefits;
•payment of ppa, interconnection, and other deposits (some of which are non-refundable);
•providing required payment and performance security for the development of the project, such as through the provision of letters of credit; and
•timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction.
successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected, delayed and/or rendered infeasible by numerous factors, including:
•delays in obtaining and maintaining required governmental permits and approvals, including appeals of approvals obtained;
•potential permit and litigation challenges from project stakeholders, including local residents, environmental organizations, labor organizations, tribes, and others who may oppose the project;
•in connection with any such permit and litigation challenges, grants of injunctive relief to stop development and/or construction of a project;
•discovery of unknown impacts to protected or endangered species or habitats, migratory birds, wetlands or other jurisdictional water resources, and/or cultural resources at project sites;
•discovery of unknown title defects;
•discovery of unknown environmental conditions;
•unforeseen engineering problems;
•construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls;
•work stoppages;
•cost over-runs;
•labor, equipment, and material supply shortages, failures, or disruptions;
•cost or schedule impacts arising from changes in federal, state, or local land-use or regulatory policies;
•changes in electric utility procurement practices;
•risks arising from potential transmission grid congestion, limited transmission capacity, and grid reliability constraints;
•project delays that could adversely impact our ability to maintain interconnection rights;
•additional complexities when conducting project development or construction activities in foreign jurisdictions (either on a stand-alone basis or in collaboration with local business partners), including operating in accordance with the fcpa and applicable local laws and customs;
•unfavorable tax treatment or adverse changes to tax policy;
•adverse weather conditions;
•water shortages;
•adverse environmental and geological conditions;
•force majeure and other events out of our control;
•climate change; and
•change in law risks.
if we fail to complete the development of a solar energy project, fail to meet one or more agreed upon target construction milestone dates, fail to achieve system-level capacity, or fail to meet other contract terms, we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under ppas or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements, incur significant liquidated damages, penalties, and/or other obligations under other project related agreements, and may not be able to recover our investment in the project. if we are unable to complete the development of a solar energy project, we may impair some or all of these capitalized investments, which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized.
we may be unable to acquire or lease land, obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights, and/or obtain the approvals, licenses, permits, and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv solar power systems in a timely and cost effective manner, and regulatory agencies, local communities, labor unions, tribes, or other third parties may delay, prevent, or increase the cost of construction and operation of the system we intend to build.
in order to construct and operate our pv solar power systems, we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way, obtain interconnection rights, negotiate agreements with affected transmission systems, and obtain all necessary federal, state, county, local, and foreign approvals, licenses, and permits, as well as rights to interconnect the systems to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the system. we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed, may not obtain or maintain satisfactory interconnection rights, may have difficulty reaching agreements with affected transmission systems and/or incur unexpected network upgrade costs, may not receive or retain the requisite approvals, permits, licenses, and interconnection and transmission rights, or may encounter other problems that could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems.
many of our proposed projects are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and right-of-way procedures and processes. our projects may also be located on tribal land pursuant to land agreements that must be approved by tribal governments and federal agencies. the authorization for the use, construction, and operation of systems and associated transmission facilities on federal, state, tribal, and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights, private rights-of-way, and other easements; environmental, agricultural, cultural, recreational, and aesthetic impacts; and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses. the inability to obtain the required permits and other federal, state, local, and tribal approvals, and any excessive delays in obtaining such permits and approvals due, for example, to litigation or third-party appeals, could potentially prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems in a timely manner and could result in the potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project. moreover, project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions, including mitigation requirements and costs, could affect the financial success of a given project. changing regulatory requirements and the discovery of unknown site conditions could also affect the financial success of a given project.
in addition, local labor unions may increase the cost of project development in california and elsewhere. we may also be subject to labor unavailability and/or increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region.
we may not be able to obtain long-term contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments; with regard to projects for which electricity is or will be sold on an open contract basis rather than under a ppa, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent prevailing spot electricity prices decline in an unexpected manner.
obtaining long-term contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects. we must compete for ppas against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects. this intense competition for ppas has resulted in downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects. in addition, we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand that put downward pressure on module pricing. this downward pressure on module pricing also creates downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects. see the risk factor entitled "competition at the system level can be intense, thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on system-level profit margins industry-wide, which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations" for additional information. if falling ppa pricing results in forecasted project revenue that is insufficient to generate returns anticipated to be demanded in the project sale market, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
other sources of power, such as natural gas-fired power plants, have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power, and certain types of generation projects, such as natural gas-fired power plants, can deliver power on a firm basis. the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue. in addition, the availability of ppas is dependent on utility and corporate energy procurement practices that could evolve and shift allocation of market risks over time. in addition, ppa availability and terms are a function of a number of economic, regulatory, tax, and public policy factors, which are also subject to change. furthermore, certain of our projects may be scheduled for substantial completion prior to the commencement of a long-term ppa with a major off-taker, in which case we would be required to enter into a stub-period ppa for the intervening time period or sell down the project. we may not be able to do either on terms that are commercially attractive to us. finally, the electricity from certain of our projects is or is expected to be sold on an open contract basis for a period of time rather than under a ppa. if prevailing spot electricity prices relating to any such project were to decline in an unexpected manner, such project may decline in value and our results of operations could otherwise be adversely affected.
even if we are able to obtain ppas favorable to us, the ability of our off-take counterparties to fulfill their contractual obligations to us depends, in part, on their creditworthiness. these counterparties, such as our investor-owned utility counterparties in the state of california, which may have liability for damages associated with california's recent wildfires, could suffer a deterioration of their creditworthiness or become, and in one case has become, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation proceedings or otherwise. for example, in january 2019, pg&e corporation and pacific gas and electric company filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code in the u.s. bankruptcy court for the northern district of california. if one or more of our counterparties becomes subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation proceedings, or if the creditworthiness of any counterparty deteriorates, we could experience an underpayment or nonpayment under ppa agreements and our ability to attract debt or equity financing for our projects could be impaired.
lack of transmission capacity availability, potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid, and other system constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv solar power systems and generate solar electricity power sales.
in order to deliver electricity from our pv solar power systems to our customers, our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid. the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size, delays in project implementation, increases in costs from transmission upgrades, and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project. in addition, there could be unexpected costs required to complete transmission and network upgrades that adversely impact the economic viability of our pv solar power systems. these transmission and network issues and costs, as well as issues relating to the availability of large equipment such as transformers and switchgear, could significantly impact our ability to interconnect our systems to the transmission grid, build such systems, and generate solar electricity sales.
competition at the system level can be intense, thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on system-level profit margins industry-wide, which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations.
the significant decline in pv solar module prices over the last several years continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers, but it has also helped drive demand for solar electricity worldwide. aided by such lower module prices, our customers and potential customers have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas, using low cost assumptions for modules, bos parts, installation, maintenance, and other costs as the basis for such bids. relatively low barriers to entry for solar project developers, including those we compete with, have led to, depending on the market and other factors, intense competition at the system level, which may result in an environment in which system-level pricing falls rapidly, thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers, and diversified companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. accordingly, while we believe our system offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors, we may fail to correctly identify our competitive position, we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new system projects at economically attractive rates of return, and we may not otherwise be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our long-term strategic plans.
depending on the market opportunity, we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential system-level competitors. for example, certain of our competitors may have a stronger and/or more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region. certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and, as a result, may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole. certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital and/or other incentives, which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time.
additionally, depending on the geographic area, certain potential customers may still be in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar energy solutions, including a company's proven overall experience and bankability, system design and optimization expertise, grid interconnection and stabilization expertise, and proven o&m capabilities. if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale, or if available competitive pricing is prioritized over the value we believe is added through our system offerings and experience, from the viewpoint of our potential customer base, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
following an evaluation of the long-term cost structure, competitiveness, and risk-adjusted returns of our o&m services business, we received an offer to purchase certain portions of the business and determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction. as a result, in august 2020 we entered into an agreement with clairvest for the sale of our north american o&m operations. the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions, including the receipt of certain third-party consents and other customary closing conditions. assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions, we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021.
following an evaluation of the long-term cost structure, competitiveness, and risk-adjusted returns of our u.s. project development business, we have determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue the sale of this business. on january 24, 2021, we entered into an agreement with omers for the sale of our u.s. project development operations, which comprises the business of developing, contracting for the construction of, and selling utility-scale pv solar power systems. the transaction includes our approximately 10 gwac utility-scale solar project pipeline, including the advanced-stage horizon, madison, ridgely, rabbitbrush, and oak trail projects that are expected to commence construction in the next two years; the 30 mwac barilla solar project, which is operational; and certain other equipment. in addition, omers has agreed to certain module purchase commitments. the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approval from ferc, the expiration of the mandatory waiting period under u.s. antitrust laws, a review of the transaction by cfius, and other customary closing conditions. assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions, we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021.
our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts.
the construction of large utility-scale solar power projects in many cases requires project financing, including non-recourse project specific debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets. uncertainties exist as to whether our planned projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction. if we, or purchasers of our projects, are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plans. in addition, we generally expect to sell interests in our projects by raising project equity capital from tax-oriented, strategic industry, and other equity investors. such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts or on unfavorable terms, in which case our ability to sell interests in our projects may be delayed or limited, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. uncertainty in or adverse changes to tax policy or tax law, including the amount of itc or accelerated depreciation, and any limitations on the value or availability to potential investors of tax incentives that benefit solar energy projects such as the itc and accelerated depreciation deductions, as well as the reduction of the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21% under the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") (which could reduce the value of these tax related incentives) may reduce project values or negatively affect our ability to timely secure equity investment for our projects.
depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets, interest rates and other factors, such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts. if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of system construction services from us, we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales, which could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business and/or generate revenue. see also the risk factor above entitled "an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets (including a reduction in total tax equity availability) could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems and/or lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings."
developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of sales contracts, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
solar power project development cycles, which span the time between the identification of a site location and the construction of a system, vary substantially and can take years to mature. as a result of these long project development cycles, we may need to make significant up-front investments of resources (including, for example, payments for land rights, large transmission and ppa deposits, or other payments, which may be non-refundable) in advance of the signing of sales contracts, receiving cash proceeds, or recognizing any revenue. our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with customers on favorable terms after making such upfront investments could cause us to forfeit certain nonrefundable payments or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. furthermore, we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles.
our liquidity may also be adversely affected to the extent the project sales market weakens and we are unable to sell interests in our solar projects on pricing, timing, and other terms commercially acceptable to us. in such a scenario, we may choose to continue to temporarily own and operate certain solar projects for a period of time, after which interests in the projects may be sold to third parties.
we may be subject to unforeseen costs, liabilities, or obligations when providing o&m services. in addition, certain of our o&m agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause.
we may provide ongoing o&m services to system owners under separate service agreements, pursuant to which we generally perform standard activities associated with operating a pv solar power system, including 24/7 monitoring and control, compliance activities, energy forecasting, and scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the o&m agreement for a particular project, and these are reflected in the price we charge our customers, including certain agreements which feature fixed pricing. should our estimates of o&m costs prove inaccurate (including any unexpected serial defects, unavailability of parts, or increases in inflation, labor, or bos costs), our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected. because of the potentially long-term nature of these o&m agreements, the adverse impacts on our results of operations could be significant, up to our limitation of liability capped under the terms of the agreements. in addition, certain of our o&m agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause or for convenience. the exercise of such termination rights, or the use of such rights as leverage to re-negotiate terms and conditions of an o&m agreement, including pricing terms, could adversely impact our results of operations. we may also be subject to substantial costs in the event we do not achieve certain thresholds under the effective availability guarantees included in our o&m agreements.
following an evaluation of the long-term cost structure, competitiveness, and risk-adjusted returns of our o&m services business, we received an offer to purchase certain portions of the business and determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction. as a result, in august 2020 we entered into an agreement with clairvest for the sale of our north american o&m operations. the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions, including the receipt of certain third-party consents and other customary closing conditions. assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions, we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021.
our systems business is subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate pv solar power systems in compliance with electric reliability rules.
the ongoing o&m services that we provide for system owners may subject us to regulation by the north american electric reliability corporation ("nerc"), or its designated regional representative, as a generator operator ("gop") under electric reliability rules filed with ferc. our failure to comply with the reliability rules applicable to gops could subject us to substantial fines by nerc, subject to ferc's review. in addition, the system owners that receive our o&m services may be regulated by nerc as generator owners ("go") and we may incur liability for go violations and fines levied by nerc, subject to ferc's review, based on the terms of our o&m agreements. as a system owner and operator, we may in the future be subject to regulation by nerc as a go.
risks related to regulations existing regulations and policies, changes thereto, and new regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv solar products or systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our modules, systems, or services.
the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by federal, state, local, and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities. these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. in the united states and in a number of other countries, these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future. these regulations and policies could deter end-user purchases of pv solar products or systems and investment in the r&d of pv solar technology. for example, without a mandated regulatory exception for pv solar power systems, system owners are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid. to the extent these interconnection standby fees are applicable to pv solar power systems, it is likely that they would increase the cost of such systems, which could make the systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, with respect to utilities that utilize a peak-hour pricing policy or time-of-use pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand, electricity generated by pv solar power systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peak-hour electricity, rather than the less expensive average price of electricity. modifications to the peak-hour pricing policies of utilities, such as to a flat rate for all times of the day, would require pv solar power systems to have lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources, which could adversely impact our operating results.
our modules, systems, and services are often subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering, and other matters, and tracking the requirements of individual jurisdictions is complex. any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our modules, systems, or services may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand for our modules, systems, or services. in addition, any regulatory compliance failure could result in significant management distraction, unplanned costs, and/or reputational damage.
we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa, the u.k. bribery act, and other foreign anti-bribery laws.
the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. other countries in which we operate also have anti-bribery laws, some of which prohibit improper payments to government and non-government persons and entities, and others (e.g., the fcpa and the u.k. bribery act) extend their application to activities outside their country of origin. our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws. we currently operate in, and may further expand into, key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. in addition, due to the level of regulation in our industry, our operations in certain jurisdictions, including china, india, south america, and the middle east, require substantial government contact, either directly by us or through intermediaries over whom we have less direct control, such as subcontractors, agents, and partners (such as joint venture partners), where norms can differ from u.s. standards. although we have implemented policies, procedures, and, in certain cases, contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, our officers, directors, associates, subcontractors, agents, and partners may take actions in violation of our policies, procedures, contractual arrangements, and anti-bribery laws. any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could subject us and such persons to criminal and/or civil penalties or other sanctions potentially by government prosecutors from more than one country, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and reputation.
environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our operations involve the use, handling, generation, processing, storage, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national, state, local, and international levels. these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the use, management, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and occupational health and safety. as we expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide, our environmental compliance burden may continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity. we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations. in addition, violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subject to substantial fines, penalties, criminal proceedings, third-party property damage or personal injury claims, cleanup costs, or other costs. while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements, future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies, the implementation of new, more stringent laws and regulations, or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our solar modules contain cdte and other semiconductor materials. elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure. based on existing research, the risks of exposure to cdte are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium due to cdte's limited bioavailability. in our manufacturing operations, we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates' exposure to cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures, including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators, chemical goggles, and protective clothing. relevant studies and third-party peer reviews of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our end-products is negligible. in addition, the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products, the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products, and the recycling or responsible disposal of our modules. while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates, end users, and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure, we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur. any such exposure could result in future third-party claims against us, damage to our reputation, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products. the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
the use of cadmium or cadmium compounds in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation. future regulation in this area could impact the manufacturing, sale, collection, and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products. for example, european union directive 2011/65/eu on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances ("rohs") in electrical and electronic equipment (the "rohs directive") restricts the use of certain hazardous substances, including cadmium and its compounds, in specified products. other jurisdictions, such as china, have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so. currently, pv solar modules are explicitly excluded from the scope of rohs (article 2), as adopted by the european parliament and the council in june 2011. the next general review of the rohs directive is scheduled for 2021, involving a broader discussion of the existing scope. in preparation for the next rohs revision, the european commission has started a number of pre-regulatory studies and assessments relating to the addition of new substances to the existing rohs framework, as well as the revision and optimization of the exemption process. it is unclear to what extent the existing scope exclusions will be discussed or maintained in future directives. if pv modules were to be included in the scope of future rohs revisions without an exemption or exclusion, we would be required to redesign our solar modules to reduce cadmium and other affected hazardous substances to the maximum allowable concentration thresholds in the rohs directive in order to continue to offer them for sale within the eu. as such actions would be impractical, this type of regulatory development would effectively close the eu market to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
risks related to the covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
the covid-19 pandemic has continued to have an unprecedented impact on the united states, malaysia, and other countries throughout the world, including those in which we do business or have operations. although as of the date of this filing, we have not been materially impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, the pandemic could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic could impact us continues to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, and will depend largely on subsequent developments, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, such as restrictions on travel and gatherings of people and temporary closures of or limitations on businesses and other commercial activities, and the timing and nature of policies implemented by governmental authorities to ease such measures.
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and these related containment measures and reopening policies, we may be subject to significant risks, which have the potential to materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the following:
•the continued economic disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic may result in a long-term tightening of the supply of capital in global financial markets (including, in the united states, a reduction in total tax equity availability), which could make it difficult for purchasers of our modules or our development projects to secure the debt or equity capital necessary to finance a pv solar power system, thereby delaying or reducing demand for our modules or these projects;
•purchasers of pv modules may delay module procurement in response to the covid-19 pandemic, which may result in additional pressure on global demand and average selling prices for modules, and may exacerbate structural imbalances between global pv module supply and demand;
•we may at any time be ordered by governmental authorities, or we may determine, based on our understanding of the recommendations or orders of governmental authorities, that we have to curtail or cease business operations or activities, including manufacturing;
•the failure of our suppliers or vendors to supply materials or equipment, or the failure of our vendors to install, repair, or replace our specialized equipment, due to the covid-19 pandemic, related containment measures, or limitations on logistics providers' ability to operate, may idle, slowdown, shutdown, or otherwise cause us to adjust our manufacturing capacity. we have incurred manufacturing charges associated with the ongoing covid-19 pandemic;
•the covid-19 pandemic and related containment measures may result in us incurring delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain, the approvals or rights that are required for our development projects to proceed, such as permitting, interconnection, or land usage approvals or rights, and the covid-19 pandemic and related containment measures may delay or prevent the performance by third parties of activities related to the development of these projects, such as interconnection, engineering, procurement, construction, and other activities;
•we perform substantial r&d to continue to improve our module wattage (or conversion efficiency), lower our module cost per watt, lower the overall lcoe of our pv solar power systems, and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry. the covid-19 pandemic and related containment measures, including the unavailability of our personnel and third-party partners who are engaged in r&d activities, may inhibit our r&d efforts or our ability to timely advance or commercialize these efforts; and
•in response to the covid-19 pandemic, the vast majority of our associates who are capable of performing their function remotely are telecommuting (i.e., working from home). while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cybersecurity incident with respect to associates utilizing technological communications tools, these measures may be inadequate to prevent a cybersecurity breach because of the unprecedented number of associates continuously using these tools. recently, there have been reports of a surge in widespread cyber-attacks during the covid-19 pandemic. any increase in the frequency or scope of cyber-attacks during the covid-19 pandemic may exacerbate the aforementioned cybersecurity risks. in addition, while we have, among other things, established enhanced cleaning procedures at our facilities and protocols for responding when our associates are infected, we cannot assure these will be sufficient to mitigate the risks faced by our work force or the liability we may face as a result of any outbreaks of covid-19.
if the severity and duration of the covid-19 pandemic does not abate and related containment measures are not lifted, are eased more slowly than anticipated, or are reinstituted, many of the other risks described herein may have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
general risk factors if our long-lived assets or project related assets become impaired, we may be required to record significant charges to earnings.
we may be required to record significant charges to earnings should we determine that our long-lived assets or project related assets are impaired. such charges may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. we review long-lived and project related assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. we consider a project commercially viable or recoverable if it is anticipated to be sold for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed or if the expected operating cash flows from future power generation exceed the cost basis of the asset. if our projects are not considered commercially viable, we would be required to impair the respective assets.
our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.
we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, and obtain additional financing, if needed, because the senior secured credit facility made available under our amended and restated credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. as administrative agent (the "revolving credit facility") and certain of our project financing arrangements contain, and other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:
•incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;
•create liens;
•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;
•sell certain assets; and
•declare or pay dividends, make other distributions to stockholders, or make other restricted payments.
under our revolving credit facility and certain of our project financing arrangements, we are also subject to certain financial covenants. our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance or the performance of specifically financed projects, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. in addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements, which if not cured or waived, could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause cross-defaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such agreements, as well as cross-defaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements and could also result in requirements to post additional security instruments to secure future obligations. in addition, certain events that occur within the company, or in the industry or the economy as a whole, may constitute material adverse effects under these agreements. if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred, the lenders can, under certain circumstances, restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding amounts. if any of our debt is accelerated, we may experience cross-defaults under our other debt or operational agreements, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
cyber-attacks or other breaches of our information systems, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our operations rely on our computer systems, hardware, software, and networks, as well as those of third parties with which we do business, to securely process, store, and transmit proprietary, confidential, and other information, including intellectual property. we also rely heavily on these information systems to operate our manufacturing lines and pv solar power plants. these information systems may be compromised by cyber-attacks, computer viruses, and other events that could be materially disruptive to our business operations and could put the security of our information, and that of the third parties with which we do business, at risk of misappropriation or destruction. in recent years, such cyber incidents have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated, targeting or otherwise affecting a wide range of companies. while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cyber incident, there is no assurance that these measures, or those of the third parties with which we do business, will be adequate in the future. if these measures fail, valuable information may be lost; our manufacturing, development, construction, o&m, and other operations may be disrupted; we may be unable to fulfill our customer obligations; and our reputation may suffer. for example, any cyber incident affecting our automated manufacturing lines could adversely affect our ability to produce solar modules or otherwise affect the quality and performance of the modules produced. we may also be subject to litigation, regulatory action, remedial expenses, and financial losses beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage. these consequences of a failure of security measures could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, the vast majority of our associates who are capable of performing their function remotely are telecommuting, which may exacerbate the aforementioned cybersecurity risks. see the risk factor entitled "the covid-19 pandemic could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations."
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future business combinations or acquisition transactions, and integration of business combinations may disrupt our business and management.
we have made several acquisitions in prior years and in the future we may acquire additional companies, project pipelines, products, equity interests, or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such business combinations or acquisitions, and each transaction has numerous risks, which may include the following:
•difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired or partner company;
•difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired products or technologies with our current products or technologies;
•difficulty in achieving profitable commercial scale from acquired technologies;
•difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures, and policies during the transition and integration;
•disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and associates from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues;
•difficulty integrating the acquired or partner company's accounting, management information, and other administrative systems;
•difficulty managing joint ventures with our partners, potential litigation with joint venture partners, and reliance upon joint ventures that we do not control;
•inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;
•inability to retain key customers, vendors, and other business partners of the acquired business;
•inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses, as a result of insufficient capital resources or otherwise;
•incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;
•potential impairment of our relationships with our associates, customers, partners, distributors, or third-party providers of products or technologies;
•potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, legal and financial liabilities, among other things;
•potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective;
•potential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions; and
•potential delay in customer purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings.
mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. in addition, we may seek to dispose of our interests in acquired companies, project pipelines, products, or technologies. we may not recover our initial investment in such interests, in part or at all, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team.
we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team. the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business. we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and may not have adequate succession plans in place. several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain post-employment non-competition provisions. however, these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice.
if we are unable to attract, train, and retain key personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected.
our future success depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, train, and retain management, operations, sales, and technical personnel, including personnel in foreign jurisdictions. recruiting and retaining capable personnel, particularly those with expertise in the pv solar industry across a variety of technologies, are vital to our success. there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel, and while we continue to benchmark our organization against the broad spectrum of business in our market space to remain economically competitive, there can be no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain our technical personnel. if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates, or otherwise experience unexpected labor disruptions within our business, we may be materially and adversely affected.
we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, which, if determined adversely to us, could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology.
our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and know-how without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties. the validity and scope of claims relating to pv solar technology patents involve complex scientific, legal, and factual considerations and analysis and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties. the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, patent opposition proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel. an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, or pay ongoing royalties, require us to redesign our solar modules, or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies. protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation.
currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our results of operations.
although our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar, we conduct certain business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. as a result, we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk. for example, certain of our net sales in 2020 were denominated in foreign currencies, such as japanese yen and euro, and we expect to continue to have net sales denominated in foreign currencies in the future. joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners outside the united states have involved, and in the future may involve, significant investments denominated in local currencies. changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the u.s. dollar could affect our results of operations and result in exchange gains or losses. we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations.
we could also expand our business into emerging markets, many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy. conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase, due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds.
our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us. deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposures; and therefore, result in exchange gains or losses.
unanticipated changes in our tax provision, the enactment of new tax legislation, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.
we are subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate. in march 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (the "cares act") was signed into law. the changes included in the cares act are broad and complex, and the final effects of the cares act may differ from the amounts provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in regulations related to the cares act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the cares act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the cares act, or actions we may take as a result of the cares act. additionally, longstanding international tax laws that determine each country's jurisdictional tax rights in cross-border international trade continue to evolve as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements recommended by the oecd. as these and other tax laws and regulations change, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we are subject to potential tax examinations in various jurisdictions, and taxing authorities may disagree with our interpretations of u.s. and foreign tax laws and may assess additional taxes. we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision; however, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. therefore, the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, losses of tax holidays, changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings among countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. any changes in our effective tax rate may materially and adversely impact our results of operations.
we have been and may be subject to or involved in litigation or threatened litigation, the outcome of which may be difficult to predict, and which may be costly to defend, divert management attention, require us to pay damages, or restrict the operation of our business.
from time to time, we have been and may be subject to disputes and litigation, with and without merit, that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general, whether or not any dispute actually proceeds to litigation. the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. moreover, complaints filed against us may not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek, and we therefore may be unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us. even if we are able to estimate losses related to these actions, the ultimate amount of loss may be materially higher than our estimates. any resolution of litigation, or threatened litigation, could involve the payment of damages or expenses by us, which may be significant, involve an agreement with terms that restrict the operation of our business, or adversely impact our ability to proceed with the construction or sale of a given project. even if any future lawsuits are not resolved against us, the costs of defending such lawsuits may be significant. these costs may exceed the dollar limits of our insurance policies or may not be covered at all by our insurance policies. because the price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, we can provide no assurance that additional securities or other litigation will not be filed against us in the future. see note 13. "commitments and contingencies - legal proceedings" to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our legal proceedings.
changes in, or any failure to comply with, privacy laws, regulations, and standards may adversely affect our business.
personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the united states, europe, and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate. the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. furthermore, federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws and regulations affecting data privacy, all of which may be subject to invalidation by relevant foreign judicial bodies. industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area.
in the united states, these include rules and regulations promulgated or pending under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general, legislatures, and consumer protection agencies. internationally, many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we, relevant suppliers, and customers must comply. for example, the general data protection regulation, a broad-based data privacy regime enacted by the european parliament, which became effective in may 2018, imposes new requirements on how we collect, process, transfer, and store personal data, and also imposes additional obligations, potential penalties, and risk upon our business. additionally, the california consumer privacy act, which became effective in january 2020, imposes similar data privacy requirements. in many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising. in addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. although we have implemented policies, procedures, and, in certain cases, contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and standards, any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional fines, costs, and liabilities to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as described under the "note regarding forward-looking statements" that appears earlier in this annual report on form 10-k. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under item 1a. "risk factors," and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion and analysis does not address certain items in respect of the year ended december 31, 2018 in reliance on amendments to disclosure requirements adopted by the sec in 2019. see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019 for comparative discussions of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.
executive overview we are a leading global provider of pv solar energy solutions. we design, manufacture, and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture. additionally, in certain markets we provide o&m services to system owners. we have substantial, ongoing r&d efforts focused on various technology innovations. we are the world's largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world's largest pv solar module manufacturers.
certain of our financial results and other key operational developments for the year ended december 31, 2020 include the following:
•net sales for 2020 decreased by 11% to $2.7 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2019. the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the completion of substantially all construction activities at the sun streams, phoebe, sunshine valley, rosamond, seabrook, and lake hancock projects in 2019, the sale of the beryl and little bear projects in 2019, and lower construction activities at the ga solar 4 project in the current period, partially offset by the sale of the ishikawa, american kings, miyagi, anamizu, tungabhadra, and anantapur projects in 2020 and an increase in the volume of modules sold to third parties.
•gross profit increased 7.2 percentage points to 25.1% during 2020 from 17.9% during 2019 primarily due to higher gross profit on third-party module sales and improved throughput of our manufacturing facilities from the successful ramp of various series 6 manufacturing lines, partially offset by the higher benefit from reductions to our product warranty liability in the prior period and an impairment loss for certain module manufacturing equipment.
•during late 2020, we completed the capacity expansion of our manufacturing facility in perrysburg, ohio. as of december 31, 2020 we had 6.3 gwdc of total installed series 6 nameplate production capacity across all our facilities. we produced 6.1 gwdc of solar modules during 2020, which represented a 59% increase in series 6 module production from 2019. the increase in series 6 production was primarily driven by the production capacity added in 2019 at our second facility in ho chi minh city, vietnam and our facility in lake township, ohio as well as higher throughput at various facilities. we expect to produce between 7.4 gwdc and 7.6 gwdc of series 6 modules during 2021.
•in response to the covid-19 pandemic, governmental authorities have recommended or ordered the limitation or cessation of certain business or commercial activities in jurisdictions in which we operate, including the united states, malaysia, and vietnam. at this time, such limitations have had limited effect on our series 6 manufacturing facilities. however, these orders are subject to continuous revision, and our understanding of the applicability of these orders and any potential exemptions may change at any time. to enable the continuity of our operations, we have implemented a wide range of safety measures intended to inhibit the spread of covid-19 at our manufacturing, administrative, and other sites and facilities.
•following an evaluation of the long-term cost structure, competitiveness, and risk-adjusted returns of our o&m services business, we received an offer to purchase certain portions of the business and determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction. as a result, in august 2020 we entered into an agreement with clairvest for the sale of our north american o&m operations. the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions, including the receipt of certain third-party consents and other customary closing conditions. assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions, we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021.
•following an evaluation of the long-term cost structure, competitiveness, and risk-adjusted returns of our u.s. project development business, we have determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue the sale of this business. on january 24, 2021, we entered into an agreement with omers for the sale of our u.s. project development operations, which comprises the business of developing, contracting for the construction of, and selling utility-scale pv solar power systems. the transaction includes our approximately 10 gwac utility-scale solar project pipeline, including the advanced-stage horizon, madison, ridgely, rabbitbrush, and oak trail projects that are expected to commence construction in the next two years; the 30 mwac barilla solar project, which is operational; and certain other equipment. in addition, omers has agreed to certain module purchase commitments. the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approval from ferc, the expiration of the mandatory waiting period under u.s. antitrust laws, a review of the transaction by cfius, and other customary closing conditions. assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions, we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021.
•in january 2020, we entered into a memorandum of understanding ("mou") to settle a class action lawsuit filed in 2012 in the united states district court for the district of arizona (hereafter "arizona district court") against the company and certain of our current and former officers and directors (the "class action"). pursuant to the mou, we paid a total of $350 million to settle the claims brought on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the company's shares during a specified period, in exchange for mutual releases and a dismissal with prejudice of the complaint upon court approval of the settlement. the settlement contained no admission of liability, wrongdoing, or responsibility by any of the parties. the arizona district court entered an order in june 2020 that granted final approval of the settlement and dismissed the class action with prejudice.
•in june 2020, we entered into an agreement in principle to settle certain claims filed in 2015 in the arizona district court by putative stockholders that opted out of the class action (the "opt-out action"). in july 2020, the parties executed a definitive settlement agreement pursuant to which we agreed to pay a total of $19 million in exchange for mutual releases and a dismissal with prejudice of the opt-out action. the agreement contained no admission of liability, wrongdoing, or responsibility by any of the parties. in july 2020, first solar funded the settlement and the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal. in september 2020, the arizona district court entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice.
market overview the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. in particular, module average selling prices in many global markets have declined in recent years and are expected to continue to decline in the future. furthermore, the covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected certain purchasers of modules and systems, which may result in additional pressure on demand and average selling prices. in the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. accordingly, we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will also put pressure on pricing, which may be exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic's disruption of the global economy. additionally, intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, thereby potentially increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers and diversified module manufacturers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. in light of such market realities, we continue to focus on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced module technology, our manufacturing process, our diversified capabilities, our financial viability, and the sustainability advantage of our modules and systems.
global solar markets continue to expand and develop, in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining average selling prices, both at the module and system levels, which have promoted the widespread adoption of solar energy. as a result of such market opportunities, we are expanding our manufacturing capacity and developing solar projects in certain markets as we execute on our utility-scale project pipeline. see the tables under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - systems project pipeline" for additional information about projects within our advanced-stage pipeline. although we expect a meaningful portion of our future consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows to be derived from such projects, we expect third-party module sales to continue to have a more significant impact on our operating results as we expand capacity and leverage the benefits of our series 6 module technology.
lower industry module and system pricing is expected to contribute to diversification in global electricity generation and further demand for solar energy. over time, however, declining average selling prices may adversely affect our results of operations to the extent we have not already entered into contracts for future module or system sales. our results of operations could also be adversely affected if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs, bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements or ppas, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time. for certain of our competitors, such actions may be enabled by their direct or indirect access to sovereign capital or other forms of state-owned support. in certain markets in california and elsewhere, an oversupply imbalance at the grid level may reduce short-to-medium term demand for new solar installations relative to prior years, lower ppa pricing, and lower margins on module and system sales to such markets. however, we believe the effects of such imbalance can be mitigated by modern solar power plants and energy storage solutions that offer a flexible operating profile, thereby promoting greater grid stability and enabling a higher penetration of solar energy. we continue to address these uncertainties, in part, by executing on our module technology improvements, partnering with grid operators and utility companies, and implementing certain other cost reduction initiatives.
we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and developers of solar power projects. solar module manufacturers compete with one another on price and on several module value attributes, including wattage (through a larger form factor or an improved conversion efficiency), energy yield, and reliability, and developers of systems compete on various factors such as net present value, return on equity, and lcoe. many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers have transitioned from lower efficiency bsf multi-crystalline cells (the legacy technology against which we have generally competed) to higher efficiency perc mono-crystalline cells at competitive cost structures. additionally, while conventional solar modules, including the solar modules we produce, are monofacial, meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side, certain manufacturers of mono-crystalline perc modules offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module. the cost effective manufacture of bifacial perc modules has been enabled, in part, by the expansion of inexpensive crystal growth and diamond wire saw capacity in china. bifaciality compromises nameplate efficiency, but by converting both front and rear side irradiance, such technology may improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications, which, after considering the incremental bos and other costs, could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules, including the modules we produce.
we believe we are among the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis, based on publicly available information. this cost competitiveness allows us to compete favorably in markets where pricing for modules and systems is highly competitive. our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our advanced thin-film semiconductor technology, module wattage (or conversion efficiency), proprietary manufacturing process (which enables us to produce a cdte module in a matter of hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process, as opposed to a batch process), and our focus on operational excellence. in addition, our cdte modules use approximately 1-2% of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon solar modules. the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules, and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels. in recent years, polysilicon consumption per cell has been reduced through various initiatives, such as the adoption of diamond wire saw technology, which have contributed to declines in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over conventional crystalline silicon module manufacturers.
in terms of energy yield, in many climates our cdte solar modules provide an energy production advantage over crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating. for example, our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient, which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system's generation, on average, occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c (standard test conditions). in addition, our cdte solar modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards. our cdte solar modules also provide a better partial shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules, which may experience significantly lower energy generation than cdte solar modules when partial shading occurs. as a result of these and other factors, our pv solar modules typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than conventional modules with the same nameplate capacity. furthermore, our thin-film cdte semiconductor technology is immune to cell cracking and its resulting power output loss, a common failure often observed in crystalline silicon modules caused by poor manufacturing, handling, weather, or other conditions.
while our modules and systems are generally competitive in cost, reliability, and performance attributes, there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all. any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and systems and additional margin compression. we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules and systems by accelerating progress along our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps.
certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties. see item 1a. "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for discussions of other risks that may affect us.
our long-term strategic plans are focused on our goal to create long-term shareholder value through a balance of growth, profitability, and liquidity. in executing such plans, we are focusing on providing utility-scale pv solar energy solutions in key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for mass-scale pv solar electricity, including markets throughout the united states, japan, europe, india, and certain other strategic markets. while these markets are expected to exhibit strong long-term demand for solar energy, the economic disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected near-term demand for electricity at the grid level. as a result, such temporary decline in load may adversely affect demand for specific forms of generation, such as our pv solar energy solutions, depending on the severity and duration of the economic disruption. given these market dynamics, we continue to focus on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions compete directly with traditional forms of energy generation on an lcoe or similar basis, or complement such generation offerings. these opportunities include the retirement and replacement of aging fossil fuel-based generation resources with utility-scale pv solar energy solutions. for example, cumulative global retirements of coal generation plants are expected to approximate 900 gwdc by 2040, representing a significant increase in the potential market for solar energy.
this focus on our core module and utility-scale offerings exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar, particularly in the united states. while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utility-scale based offerings over the next several years, we believe that utility-scale solar will continue to be a compelling offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix. however, our module offerings in certain international markets may be driven, in part, by future demand for rooftop and distributed generation solar solutions.
our ability to provide utility-scale offerings on economically attractive terms depends, in part, on market factors outside our control, such as the availability of debt and/or equity financing (including, in the united states, tax equity financing), interest rate fluctuations, domestic or international trade policies, and government support programs. adverse changes in these factors could increase the cost of utility-scale systems, which could reduce demand for such systems and limit the number of potential buyers. for example, we generally sell projects we have developed within our systems business to purchasers that depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditures required to develop, build, and/or purchase a system. although governments and central banks around the world have implemented significant measures to support capital markets, the economic disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic may result in a long-term tightening of the supply of capital in global financial markets (including, in the united states, a reduction in total tax equity availability). a reduction in the supply of project debt or equity financing (including, in the united states, tax equity financing) caused by the covid-19 pandemic could make it difficult for our customers to secure the financing necessary to develop, build, purchase, or install systems. similarly, purchasers of modules may cease or significantly reduce business operations, cease or delay module procurement, encounter an inability to obtain financing, including due to a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or equity investments (including, in the united states, tax equity financing), conserve capital resources, or take other actions in response to the covid-19 pandemic, which may reduce demand and average selling prices for our modules.
in certain markets, demand for our utility-scale offerings may be affected by specific regulations or policies of governmental bodies or utility regulators. for example, in june 2020, the japanese legislature enacted an amendment to the electricity business law enforcement order for the ministry of economy, trade and industry of japan which, among other things, is expected to invalidate the feed-in-tariff certificates for projects that fail to achieve construction plan acceptance, submit an interconnection application, and/or achieve commercial operation within a set period of time following dates specified in their respective certificates. the amendment, which becomes effective in april 2022, applies to all projects regardless of generation type and is intended to release grid capacity reserved for delayed projects to enable other newly developed projects to utilize such capacity at a lower cost of electricity to consumers. the deadline by which a project must achieve construction plan acceptance, submit an interconnection application, and/or achieve commercial operation varies by project, but is no earlier than march 2023. any deadlines that precede the expected construction plan acceptance and/or commercial operation dates of our various projects in japan could adversely affect the value of such projects and our ability to secure any related project financing.
we intend to focus our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least-cost, best-fit energy solution, particularly in regions with significant current or projected electricity demand, relatively high existing electricity prices, strong demand for renewable energy generation, and high solar resources. as a result, we closely evaluate and monitor the appropriate level of resources required to support such markets and their associated sales opportunities. we have dedicated, and intend to continue to dedicate, significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market.
creating or maintaining a market position in certain strategically targeted markets and energy applications also requires us to adapt to new and changing market conditions, including changes in the market set of potential buyers of our modules and solar projects. market environments with few potential project buyers and a higher cost of capital would generally exert downward pressure on the potential revenue from such offerings, whereas, conversely, market environments with many potential project buyers and a lower cost of capital would likely have a favorable impact on the potential revenue from such offerings. for example, the emergence of utility-owned generation has increased the number of potential project buyers as such utility customers benefit from a potentially low cost of capital available through rate-based utility investments. given their long-term ownership profile, utility-owned generation customers typically seek to partner with diversified and stable companies that can provide a broad spectrum of utility-scale generation solutions, including reliable pv solar technology, thereby mitigating their long-term ownership risks.
on occasion, we may elect to develop partially contracted or uncontracted systems for which there is a partial or no ppa with an off-taker, such as a utility, but rather an intent to sell some portion of the electricity produced by the system on an open contract basis until the system is sold. expected revenue from projects without a ppa for the full off-take of the system is subject to greater variability and uncertainty based on market factors and is typically lower than projects with a ppa for the full off-take of the system. furthermore, all system pricing is affected by the pricing of energy to be sold on an open contract basis following the termination of the ppa (i.e., merchant pricing curves), and changes in market assumptions regarding future open contract sales, including potential changes in energy demand caused by the covid-19 pandemic, may also result in significant variability and uncertainty in the value of our systems projects.
we continually evaluate forecasted global demand, competition, and our addressable market and seek to effectively balance manufacturing capacity with market demand and the nature and extent of our competition. we continue to increase the nameplate production capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities by improving our production throughput, increasing module wattage (or conversion efficiency), and improving manufacturing yield losses. as we evaluate the potential for future capacity expansion, we may also seek to further diversify our manufacturing presence, although we have made no decisions to do so at this time. such additional capacity, and any other potential investments to add or otherwise modify our existing manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition, may require significant internal and possibly external sources of capital, and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a. "risk factors," including those described under the headings "our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand, convert existing production facilities to support new product lines, decrease our cost per watt, and, when necessary, continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to market demand, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties" and "if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules, it may adversely affect our future growth plans. if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines, our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers."
in response to the covid-19 pandemic, governmental authorities have recommended or ordered the limitation or cessation of certain business or commercial activities in jurisdictions in which we do business or have operations. while some of these orders permit the continuation of essential business operations, or permit the performance of minimum business activities, these orders are subject to continuous revision or may be revoked or superseded, or our understanding of the applicability of these orders and exemptions may change at any time. in addition, due to contraction of the virus, or concerns about becoming ill from the virus, we may experience reductions in the availability of our operational workforce, such as our manufacturing personnel. as a result, we may at any time be ordered by governmental authorities, or we may determine, based on our understanding of the recommendations or orders of governmental authorities or the availability of our personnel, that we have to curtail or cease business operations or activities altogether, including manufacturing, fulfillment, project development, construction, operating or maintenance operations, or research and development activities. at this time, such limitations have had a limited effect on our manufacturing facilities and certain project construction activities, and we have implemented a wide range of safety measures intended to enable the continuity of our operations and inhibit the spread of covid-19 at our manufacturing, administrative, and other sites and facilities, including those in the united states, malaysia, and vietnam.
to address the near-term business disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic, many governments have proposed policies or support programs intended to stimulate their respective economies. such support programs may include additional incentives for renewable energy projects, including pv solar power systems, over several years. while we compete in many markets that do not require solar-specific government subsidies or support programs, our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives.
systems project pipeline the following tables summarize, as of february 25, 2021, our approximately 1.3 gwac advanced-stage project pipeline. the actual volume of modules installed in our projects will be greater than the project size in mwac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mwdc, which will be greater than the mwac size pursuant to a dc-ac ratio typically ranging from 1.1 to 1.4. such ratio varies across different projects due to many factors, including ppa pricing and the location, design, and costs of the system. projects are typically removed from our advanced-stage project pipeline tables below once we substantially complete construction of the project and after substantially all of the associated project revenue is recognized. a project, or a portion of a project, may also be removed from the tables below in the event the project is not able to be sold due to the changing economics of the project or other factors or we decide to temporarily own and operate the project based on strategic opportunities or market factors.

segment overview we operate our business in two segments. our modules segment involves the design, manufacture, and sale of cdte solar modules to third parties, and our systems segment includes the development, construction contracting and management, operation, maintenance, and sale of pv solar power systems, including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue from energy generated by such systems.
net sales modules business we generally price and sell our solar modules on a per watt basis. during 2020, longroad energy, nextera energy, and softbank each accounted for more than 10% of our modules business net sales, and the majority of our solar modules were sold to integrators and operators of systems in the united states and france. substantially all of our modules business net sales during 2020 were denominated in u.s. dollars and euro. we recognize revenue for module sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of the modules to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. the revenue recognition policies for module sales are further described in note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements.
systems business during 2020, goldman sachs renewable power, smfl mirai partners, and mitsui & co. each accounted for more than 10% of our systems business net sales, and the majority of our systems business net sales were in the united states and japan. substantially all of our systems business net sales during 2020 were denominated in u.s. dollars and japanese yen. we recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems using cost based input methods, which result in revenue being recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for a given contract. we may also recognize revenue for the sale of a development project, which excludes epc services, or for the sale of a completed system when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer. the revenue recognition policies for our systems business are further described in note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements.

net sales from our modules segment increased by $275.9 million in 2020 primarily due to a 21% increase in the volume of watts sold, partially offset by a 2% decrease in the average selling price per watt. net sales from our systems segment decreased by $627.7 million in 2020 primarily due to the completion of substantially all construction activities at the sun streams, phoebe, sunshine valley, rosamond, seabrook, and lake hancock projects in 2019, the sale of the beryl and little bear projects in 2019, and lower construction activities at the ga solar 4 project in the current period, partially offset by the sale of the ishikawa, american kings, miyagi, anamizu, tungabhadra, and anantapur projects in 2020.
cost of sales modules business our modules business cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules, such as glass, transparent conductive coatings, cdte and other thin film semiconductors, laminate materials, connector assemblies, edge seal materials, and frames. in addition, our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead, such as engineering, equipment maintenance, quality and production control, and information technology. our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment, facility-related expenses, environmental health and safety costs, and costs associated with shipping, warranties, and solar module collection and recycling (excluding accretion).
systems business for our systems business, project-related costs include development costs (legal, consulting, transmission upgrade, interconnection, permitting, and other similar costs), epc costs (consisting primarily of solar modules, inverters, electrical and mounting hardware, project management and engineering, and construction labor), and site specific costs.

cost of sales decreased $483.2 million, or 19%, and decreased 7.2 percentage points as a percent of net sales when comparing 2020 with 2019. the decrease in cost of sales was driven by a $620.1 million decrease in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to the lower volume of projects under construction during the period. such decrease in our systems segment cost of sales was partially offset by a $136.9 million increase in our modules segment cost of sales primarily as a result of the following:
•higher costs of $247.4 million from an increase in the volume of modules sold;
•an impairment loss of $17.4 million for certain module manufacturing equipment, including framing and assembly tools, which were no longer compatible with our long-term module technology roadmap;
•manufacturing related charges of $15.1 million associated with the ongoing covid-19 pandemic; and
•a reduction to our product warranty liability of $80.0 million in 2019 due to revised module return rates; partially offset by
•a reduction to our product warranty liability of $19.7 million in 2020 due to lower-than-expected settlements for our older series of module technology and revisions to projected settlements;
•lower under-utilization and certain other charges associated with the initial ramp of certain series 6 manufacturing lines, which decreased cost of sales by $61.7 million compared to 2019;
•a reduction in our module collection and recycling liability of $18.9 million primarily due to changes to the estimated timing of cash flows associated with capital, labor, and maintenance costs and updates to certain valuation assumptions; and
•continued module cost reductions, which decreased cost of sales by $157.2 million.
gross profit gross profit may be affected by numerous factors, including the selling prices of our modules and systems, our manufacturing costs, project development costs, bos costs, the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities, and foreign exchange rates. gross profit may also be affected by the mix of net sales from our modules and systems businesses.

interest income during 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and lower average balances and interest rates associated with time deposits and marketable securities.
interest expense, net interest expense, net is primarily comprised of interest incurred on long-term debt, settlements of interest rate swap contracts, and changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 815. we may capitalize interest expense to our project assets or property, plant and equipment when such costs qualify for interest capitalization, which reduces the amount of net interest expense reported in any given period.

interest expense, net in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to lower interest expense associated with project debt, partially offset by higher amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs and a decrease in capitalized interest.
other (expense) income, net other (expense) income, net is primarily comprised of miscellaneous items and realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and restricted marketable securities.

other expense, net increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower realized gains from sales of restricted marketable securities and expected credit losses associated with certain notes receivable, partially offset by prior period charges associated with certain letter of credit arrangements and the impairment of a strategic investment. see note 7. "consolidated balance sheet details" to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses for our notes receivable.
income tax benefit (expense)
income tax expense or benefit, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, principally japan, malaysia, and vietnam. significant judgments and estimates are required to determine our consolidated income tax expense. the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 21%, and the tax rates in japan, malaysia, and vietnam are 30.6%, 24%, and 20%, respectively. in malaysia, we have been granted a long-term tax holiday, scheduled to expire in 2027, pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax, conditional upon our continued compliance with certain employment and investment thresholds. in vietnam, we have been granted a tax incentive, scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, pursuant to which income earned in vietnam is subject to reduced tax rates.

our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions. the rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period, but are not consistent from period to period. income tax benefit increased by $101.8 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a tax benefit from the effect of tax law changes associated with the cares act, the reversal of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, and the release of the valuation allowance associated with our vietnamese subsidiary due to its current year operating income, partially offset by higher pretax income.
equity in earnings, net of tax equity in earnings, net of tax represents our proportionate share of the earnings or losses from equity method investments as well as any gains or losses on the sale or disposal of such investments.

liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2020, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities, contracts with customers for the future sale of solar modules, and advanced-stage project pipeline will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and systems project investment needs for at least the next 12 months. as needed, we also believe we will have adequate access to the capital markets. in addition, we have availability under our revolving credit facility, under which we have made no borrowings as of december 31, 2020. we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity, both domestically and internationally.
we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations, our overall cost of capital, and expected cash requirements for operations, such as systems project development activities in certain international regions. however, our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to company-specific, industry-wide, or broader market concerns, such as a tightening of the supply of capital due to the covid-19 pandemic and related containment measures. any incremental debt financings could result in increased debt service expenses and/or restrictive covenants, which could limit our ability to pursue our strategic plans.
as of december 31, 2020, we had $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $2.2 billion as of december 31, 2019. the decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was primarily driven by purchases of property, plant and equipment; the $350 million settlement payment associated with our prior class action lawsuit; the timing of cash receipts from certain third-party module sales, for which proceeds were received in late 2019 prior to the step down in the u.s. investment tax credit from 30% to 26%; and other operating expenditures; partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale and construction of certain systems projects. as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, $1.1 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in u.s. dollar, japanese yen, and indian rupee denominated holdings.
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. if certain international funds were needed for our operations in the united states, we may be required to accrue and pay certain u.s. and foreign taxes to repatriate such funds. we maintain the intent and ability to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings outside the united states, with the exception of our subsidiaries in canada and germany. in addition, changes to foreign government banking regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances, which could negatively impact our access to capital, resulting in an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.
we continually evaluate forecasted global demand and seek to balance our manufacturing capacity with such demand. we continue to increase the nameplate production capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities by improving our production throughput, increasing module wattage (or conversion efficiency), and improving manufacturing yield losses. during 2021, we expect to spend $425 million to $475 million for capital expenditures, including upgrades to machinery and equipment that we believe will further increase our module wattage and expand capacity and throughput at our manufacturing facilities.
we also expect to commit significant working capital to purchase various raw materials used in our module manufacturing process. our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality, quantity, and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs. accordingly, we may enter into long-term supply agreements to mitigate potential risks related to the procurement of key raw materials and components, and such agreements may be noncancelable or cancelable with a significant penalty. for example, we have entered into long-term supply agreements for the purchase of certain specified minimum volumes of substrate glass and cover glass for our pv solar modules. our remaining purchases under these supply agreements are expected to be approximately $1.8 billion of substrate glass and $410 million of cover glass. we have the right to terminate these agreements upon payment of specified termination penalties (which, in aggregate, are up to $390 million as of december 31, 2020 and decline over the remaining supply periods).
our systems business is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future. from time to time, we enter into commercial commitments in the form of letters of credit, bank guarantees, and surety bonds to provide financial and performance assurance to third parties, the majority of which support our systems projects. our revolving credit facility provides us with a sub-limit of $400.0 million to issue letters of credit, subject to certain additional limits depending on the currencies of such letters of credit. the net amount of our project assets and related portions of deferred revenue and long-term debt, which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of systems projects, was $260.6 million as of december 31, 2020. solar power project development cycles, which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system, vary substantially and can take many years to mature. as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the development of certain projects using our working capital, we may need to make significant up-front investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such projects. delays in construction or in completing the sale of our systems projects that we are self-financing may also impact our liquidity. in certain circumstances, we may need to finance construction costs exclusively using working capital, if project financing becomes unavailable due to market-wide, regional, or other concerns.
from time to time, we may develop projects in certain markets around the world where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in a project for several years. given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the u.s. dollar in some of these markets, we continue to explore local financing alternatives. should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive, we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted.
additionally, we may elect to retain an ownership interest in certain systems projects after they become operational if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so. if, for example, we cannot sell a system at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of system ownership, we may instead elect to temporarily own and operate such system until we can sell it on economically attractive terms. the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts our liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project. as of december 31, 2020, we had $243.4 million of net pv solar power systems that had been placed in service, primarily in international markets. we have elected, and may in the future elect, to enter into temporary or long-term project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital with regard to such systems.
from time to time, we may be party to legal matters and claims against us. in january 2020, we entered into an mou to settle a class action lawsuit filed in the arizona district court. pursuant to the mou, among other things, we agreed to pay a total of $350 million to settle the claims in the lawsuit in exchange for mutual releases and dismissal with prejudice of the complaint upon court approval of the settlement. in february 2020, we subsequently entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement (the "settlement agreement") with certain named plaintiffs on terms and conditions that were consistent with the mou. pursuant to the settlement agreement, among other things, (i) we contributed $350 million in cash to a settlement fund that will be used to pay all settlement fees and expenses, attorneys' fees and expenses, and cash payments to members of the settlement class and (ii) the settlement class has agreed to release us, the other defendants named in the class action, and certain of their respective related parties from any and all claims concerning, based on, arising out of, or in connection with the class action. the settlement agreement contained no admission of liability, wrongdoing, or responsibility by any of the parties. on june 30, 2020, the arizona district court entered an order granting final approval of the settlement and dismissed the class action with prejudice.

operating activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during 2020 was primarily driven by the $350 million settlement payment associated with our prior class action lawsuit as described above and the timing of cash receipts from certain third-party module sales, for which proceeds were received in late 2019 prior to the step down in the u.s. investment tax credit, partially offset by higher cash proceeds from the sale of systems projects in japan and the united states.
investing activities the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily due to lower purchases of property, plant and equipment.
financing activities the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2020 was primarily due to the repayment of the ishikawa credit agreement, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings under project specific debt financings associated with the construction of certain projects in japan.

recent accounting pronouncements see note 3. "recent accounting pronouncements" to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("u.s. gaap"), we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates. by their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, our forecasts, and other available information as appropriate. the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies that require the most significant judgment and estimates include the following:
revenue recognition - solar power system sales and/or epc services. we recognize revenue for the sale of a development project, which excludes epc services, or for the sale of a completed system when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer. for epc services, or sales of solar power systems with epc services, we generally recognize revenue over time as our performance creates or enhances an energy generation asset controlled by the customer. furthermore, the sale of a solar power system combined with epc services represents a single performance obligation for the development and construction of a single generation asset. for such arrangements, we recognize revenue and gross profit as work is performed using cost based input methods, for which we determine our progress toward contract completion based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs (including solar module costs) of the contract. such revenue recognition is also dependent, in part, on our customers' commitment to perform their obligations under the contract, which is typically measured through the receipt of cash deposits or other forms of financial security issued by creditworthy financial institutions or parent entities.
cost based input methods of revenue recognition are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy long-term construction contracts and therefore reflect the transfer of goods to a customer under such contracts. costs incurred that do not contribute to satisfying our performance obligations ("inefficient costs") are excluded from our input methods of revenue recognition as the amounts are not reflective of our transferring control of the system to the customer. costs incurred toward contract completion may include costs associated with solar modules, direct materials, labor, subcontractors, and other indirect costs related to contract performance. we recognize solar module and direct material costs as incurred when such items have been installed in a system.
cost based input methods of revenue recognition require us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete our projects. in making such estimates, significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to the amount of net contract revenues, including the impact of any performance incentives, liquidated damages, and other payments to customers. significant judgment is also required to evaluate assumptions related to the costs to complete our projects, including materials, labor, contingencies, and other system costs. if the estimated total costs on any contract, including any inefficient costs, are greater than the net contract revenues, we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. the cumulative effect of revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues or costs to complete contracts are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract. such revisions could occur in any reporting period, and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates.
as part of our solar power system sales, we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement. in addition, we may provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system's operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable period meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation, after certain adjustments. these tests are based on meteorological, energy, and equipment performance data measured at the system's location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period. in certain instances, a bonus payment may be received at the end of the applicable test period if the system performs above a specified level. conversely, if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests, we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price. such performance guarantees represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur.
revenue recognition - operations and maintenance. we recognize revenue for standard, recurring o&m services over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services. costs of o&m services are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. as part of our o&m service offerings, we typically offer an effective availability guarantee, which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside our control as the service provider. these tests are based on meteorological, energy, and equipment performance data measured at the system's location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period. if system availability exceeds a contractual threshold, we may receive a bonus payment, or if system availability falls below a separate threshold, we may incur liquidated damages for certain lost energy under the ppa. such bonuses or liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the o&m services.
accrued solar module collection and recycling liability. we previously established a module collection and recycling program, which has since been discontinued, to collect and recycle modules sold and covered under such program once the modules reach the end of their service lives. for legacy customer sales contracts that were covered under this program, we recognized expense at the time of sale for the estimated cost of our obligations to collect and recycle such modules. we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials; the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center; material, labor, and capital costs; and by-product credits for certain materials recovered during the recycling process. we base these estimates on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules and certain assumptions regarding costs at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability and classify the corresponding expense within "selling, general and administrative" expense on our consolidated statements of operations. we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly.
product warranties. we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12 years. we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years. among other things, our solar module warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking.
as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty, we have also offered an aggregated or system-level limited module performance warranty. this system-level limited module performance warranty is designed for utility-scale systems and provides 25-year system-level energy degradation protection. this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying, from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility-scale system, individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules. the system-level limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system's expected energy production, adjusted for certain actual site conditions, with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion, but never falling below 80% during the term of the warranty.
in addition to our limited solar module warranties described above, for pv solar power systems we construct, we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design, installation, and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system.
when we recognize revenue for module or system sales, we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations. we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations, our historical experience with and projections of warranty claims, and our estimated per-module replacement costs. we also monitor our expected future module performance through certain quality and reliability testing and actual performance in certain field installation sites. in general, we expect the return rates for our newer series of module technology to be lower than our older series. we estimate that the return rate for such newer series of module technology will be less than 1%.
income taxes. we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states, its states and municipalities, and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. such tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant taxing authorities. we make judgments and interpretations regarding the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and also make estimates about when in the future certain items are expected to affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the relevant taxing authority upon examination or audit. we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of our taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations, and we record tax liabilities as appropriate.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations, assess uncertain tax positions, and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense. conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense.
we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions. once established, we adjust these liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment. significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment, fine, or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities, if any.
we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our global operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives, including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions, indefinite reinvestment exception assertions, and the realizability of deferred tax assets, in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained, or when the initiatives are materially complete.
asset impairments. we assess long-lived assets classified as "held and used," including our property, plant and equipment; pv solar power systems; project assets; operating lease assets; and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise, including consideration of technological obsolescence, that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, and these assessments require significant judgment in determining whether such events or changes have occurred. these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition; a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of future losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, and we must also exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels.
when impairment indicators are present, we compare undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the asset group's carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value. fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted cash flows for the asset group, (ii) third-party valuations, and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market value for such assets. if the fair value of an asset group is determined to be less than its carrying value, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and such projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized.

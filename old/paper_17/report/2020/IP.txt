item 1a. risk factors the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance. the board of directors exercises oversight of the company's enterprise risk management program, which includes strategic, operational and financial matters, as well as compliance and legal risks. the audit and finance committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the board's standing committees and management, and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year.
in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (particularly in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations), or in the company's other filings with the securities and exchange commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. if any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures.
overall risks the current covid-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on portions of our business, and may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly if negative economic conditions associated with covid-19 persist or deteriorate. the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities throughout the world implementing widespread measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of covid-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home orders, the promotion of social distancing and limitations on business activity, including business closures. these measures and the pandemic have caused a significant global economic downturn, disrupting supply chains, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, and adversely impacting consumer confidence and spending. the continued spread of covid-19 has also led to significant disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial markets.
although governments of countries in which we operate have generally considered forest products and the supply chain on which we depend to be "essential industries" that should remain operational during this pandemic, any significant disruption in operations at one or more of our mills, plants or other table of contents facilities as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, including precautionary measures we take or are taken by governmental authorities that limits in-person workplace contact at any of our facilities to reduce the potential for employee exposure to covid-19, could have an adverse effect on our business or operations. if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to measures taken in response to the covid-19 pandemic such as those described herein, our operations will likely be negatively impacted.
covid-19 has had a significant negative impact on demand for our printing papers products. in addition, our operations in industrial packaging experienced higher supply chain costs due to the impact of covid-19.
in addition to the reduction in demand for our products that the covid-19 pandemic has had or could have, other negative impacts on our business, include, but are not limited to, the following:
•we rely on a global workforce, and we take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and others with whom we do business, while continuing to effectively manage our employees and maintain business operations. during the pandemic, we have taken additional measures and incurred additional expenses to protect the health and safety of our employees to comply with applicable government requirements and safety guidance. our business operations may be additionally disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work safely and effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions or measures responsive to the pandemic. measures taken across our business operations to address health and safety may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid-19 among our employee base, customers and others.
•a significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business, continue to work remotely in response to the covid-19 pandemic. our business operations may be disrupted, and we may experience increased risk of adverse effects to our business, if a significant portion of our workforce or certain business operations are negatively impacted as a result of remote work arrangements, including due to cyber risks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure.
•cost management and various cost-containment actions implemented across our business in response to the covid-19 pandemic could hinder execution of our business strategy, including deferral of planned capital expenditures, and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
while we are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, the extent of the impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and financial performance, as well as our ability to execute near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and which we cannot predict or control, and some of which we are not currently aware, including, but not limited to: (a) the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic, including additional waves, increases and spikes in the number of covid-19 cases in certain areas; (b) rapidly-changing governmental and public health directives to contain and combat the outbreak, including the duration, degree and effectiveness of directives, as well as the easing, removal and potential reinstitution of directives; (c) the availability and wide-spread administration of treatments and vaccines for covid-19; (d) the extent and duration of the pandemic's adverse effect on economic and social activity, consumer confidence, discretionary spending and preferences, labor and healthcare costs, and unemployment rates, any of which may reduce demand for our products; (e) any temporary reduction in our workforce, closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations; and (f) the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue their operations, which could result in terminations of contracts, losses of revenue, adverse effects to our supply chain. if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or impacts our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs.
given the inherent uncertainty surrounding covid-19, we expect the pandemic will continue to have an adverse impact on portions of our business in the near term. if these conditions persist for a prolonged period, the covid-19 pandemic, including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition.
table of contents we are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and global, regional and local weather conditions.
our operations and the operations of our suppliers are subject to climate variations, which impact the productivity of forests, the frequency and severity of wildfires, the distribution and abundance of species, and the spread of disease or insect epidemics. additionally, the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, snow, ice storms, the spread of disease, and insect infestations could also affect timber supply or cause variations in the cost of raw materials. changes in precipitation could make wildfires more frequent or more severe, and could adversely affect timber harvesting. the effects of climate change and global, regional and local weather conditions could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
risks relating to industry conditions changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy and transportation could affect our profitability. we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda and starch), energy sources (principally biomass, natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. the global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by trade policies between countries, individual governments' legislation and regulations, as well as changes in the global economy. in addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices. energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. the availability of labor and the market price for fuel may affect our costs for third-party transportation. our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.
the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences. fluctuations in the prices of, and the demand for, our products could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. in addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber substitutes. moreover, consumer preferences are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience and health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions. these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products. consequently, our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products.
competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results. we operate in a competitive environment, both in the united states and internationally, in all of our operating segments. product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, and marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results.
risks relating to market and economic factors adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations. general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. in addition, volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.
changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. specifically, russia, brazil, poland, and turkey, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world. fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the u.s. dollar, downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences or rulings, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements, could negatively affect our financial results. trade protection measures in favor table of contents of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. likewise, disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries (e.g., the u.s. and china), which can result in tariffs, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders. in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad, and the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign asset control and other non-u.s. government entities maintain economic sanctions targeting various countries, persons and entities. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.
the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business. as of december 31, 2020, international paper had approximately $8.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:
•it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;
•a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;
•the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;
•it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and
•it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.
in addition, we are subject to agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants. a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions, or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives. moreover, the restrictions associated with these financial ratios and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. additionally, despite these restrictions, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above.
moreover, certain of our variable rate debt uses the london interbank offering rate ("libor") as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. the u.k. financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021. in november 2020, the administrator of libor announced it will consult on its intention to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates whereby the publication of the one week and two month libor offered rates will cease after december 31, 2021, but the publication of the remaining libor offered rates will continue until june 20 2023. in addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. the discontinuation, reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. additionally, uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt.
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our table of contents financial strategy, and a downgrade of the company's ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market, may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. the company's desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.
under the terms of the agreements governing approximately $1.0 billion of our debt as of december 31, 2020, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade. as a result, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense. there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. any such downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.
downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes. we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes, including those delivered to temple-inland in connection with temple-inland's 2007 sales of forestlands, may be downgraded below a required rating. since 2007, certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, a number of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $488 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained. the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the company's consolidated financial statements. see note 15, variable interest entities, on pages 70 through 72, and note 13, income taxes, on pages 65 through 68, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all u.s. salaried employees hired prior to july 1, 2004 (or later for certain acquired populations, as described in note 19. retirement plans, on pages 78 through 84, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data) and substantially all hourly union and non-union employees regardless of hire date. the company has frozen participation under these plans for u.s. salaried employees, including credited service and compensation on or after january 1, 2019; however, the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through december 31, 2018. we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former u.s. employees, as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former u.s. salaried employees. our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may impact pension costs in future periods. likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs. drivers for fluctuating health costs include unit cost changes, health care utilization by participants, and potential legislative impacts and government oversight.
our pension plans are currently underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis, and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans, reducing the cash available for our business. we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," at december 31, 2020 was $1.1 billion. the amount and timing of future contributions, which could be material, will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
risks relating to our operations material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could table of contents negatively impact our financial results. we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:
•fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;
•the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;
•the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities;
•disruption in the supply of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs;
•terrorism or threats of terrorism;
•information system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes, including cyber-attacks;
•domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;
•unscheduled maintenance outages;
•prolonged power failures;
•an equipment failure;
•a chemical spill or release;
•explosion of a boiler or other equipment;
•damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;
•disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;
•a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, such as the outbreak of the covid-19 virus, or any other public health crisis;
•failure of our third party service providers and business partners to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms;
•labor difficulties; and
•other operational problems.
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.
certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit. certain operations in russia are carried on by a joint venture, ilim. in joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. in general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. in joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. in addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so we receive only our portion of those benefits.
the announced proposed spin-off of our printing papers business may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, and we may not achieve the expected benefits from the separation. on december 3, 2020, we announced a plan to pursue a spin-off of our printing papers segment into spinco, a standalone, publicly traded company. international paper will distribute shares of spinco to international paper shareholders on a pro rata basis in a manner intended to be tax-free to international paper and its shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the transaction is expected to be completed in late third quarter 2021. the proposed spin-off is subject to customary conditions, including final approval by the international paper board of directors, receipt of a tax opinion and the filing and effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission. no assurance can be given regarding the form that a spin-off transaction may take or the specific terms or timing thereof, or that a spin-off will in fact occur. in addition, international paper expects to retain up to 19.9% of the shares of table of contents spinco at the time of the separation, with the intent to monetize in the future and provide additional proceeds to international paper. no assurance can be given that we will be able to monetize the shares of spinco at a favorable price or at all, or the timing thereof.
international paper and spinco may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits, including cost savings, from the separation on the expected timeframe or at all. as independent publicly-traded companies, international paper and spinco will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, such as changes in the industrial packaging or printing papers industry, which could result in increased volatility in their respective cash flows, working capital and financing requirements and could materially and adversely affect the respective business, financial condition and results of operations. in connection with the transaction, spinco is expected to pay international paper a dividend to be used to pay down outstanding international paper indebtedness. there can be no assurance that spinco will be able to pay a dividend, the amount of any such dividend, or that any dividend paid will be sufficient to repay the amount of indebtedness expected. further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of international paper's common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.
moreover, substantial expenses will be incurred in connection with the transaction. such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates. accordingly, the benefits from the transaction may be offset by costs or delays incurred in effectuating the transaction. executing the proposed transaction will require significant time and attention from international paper's senior management and employees, which could disrupt international paper's ongoing business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations.
we may not achieve the expected benefits from strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we have pursued or may pursue. our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we may pursue and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions, and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits. this failure could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net earnings. among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper.
corporate transactions of this nature which we may pursue involve a number of special risks, including with respect to our inability to realize our business goals with respect to such transactions as noted above, the focus of our management's attention on these transactions and the assimilation of acquired businesses into our operations, the demands on our financial, operational and information technology systems resulting from acquired businesses, and the possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities as the result of acquisitions or other corporate transactions.
we are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company, customer, employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes. our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers or joint venture partners, could become subject to employee error or malfeasance, cyber-attacks, such as ransomware and data theft, by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social activist ("hacktivist") organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events. network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper. access to applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, table of contents employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.
risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways, and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations.  our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. laws, regulations and other government requirements -- including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, tax, trade and health care. there can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs.
for example, we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. our environmental expenditures include, among other areas, those related to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater, including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party. moreover, we may be directly impacted by, and are working to manage, the risks and costs to us, our customers and our vendors of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and the availability of energy and water resources. these risks include the potentially adverse impact on forestlands, which are a key resource in the production of our products, increased product costs and a change in the types of products that customers purchase. we also face risks arising from the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, deforestation, and land use. these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. these risks could expose us to market, operational, and execution costs or risks. there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.
our global operations subject us to complex and evolving u.s and international privacy laws and regulations, such as general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), brazil's lei geral de pnoteçāo de dados ("lgpd") and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ("ccpa") and the california privacy rights act ("cpra"). these laws require the company to comply with a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. these are significant penalties for non-compliance including monetary fines, disruption of operations and reputational harm. moreover, governmental authorities around the world are considering, or are in the process of implementing new data protection regulations.
many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application, interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims, changes to our business practices, data processing and security systems, penalties, increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses. the recently enacted laws often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as private rights of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. ip proactively uses internal and external resources to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and continually evaluates and, where necessary, modifies its data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws. nevertheless, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. in addition, there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper disclosure of personal data. improper disclosure of personal data in violation of the gdpr, the ccpa and/or of other personal data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer table of contents confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.
as a final example, the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities. additionally, administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent, and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain. while we believe the positions reported by the company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations, taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently. we are currently subject to tax audits in the u.s., brazil, poland, russia and other taxing jurisdictions around the world. in some cases, we have appealed and may continue to appeal, assessments by taxing authorities in the court system. as such, tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses, higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties.
results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial results. we are a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters, including with respect to environmental matters. in addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. should an unfavorable outcome occur in connection with our legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial results.
if the spin-off were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then international paper, spinco and our shareholders may be subject to significant u.s. federal income taxes. international paper intends to receive an opinion of tax counsel, to the effect that the spin-off and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to spinco, international paper and its shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes. a tax opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. in addition, international paper's tax counsel will rely on certain representations and covenants delivered by international paper and spinco in rendering such opinion. international paper may also pursue a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that the spin-off and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to international paper, spinco and international paper shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes.
if the irs ultimately determines that the spin-off is taxable, then the spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to the international paper shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes, international paper could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities, and spinco may be required to indemnify international paper for such tax liability pursuant to a tax matters agreement. there can be no assurance that spinco would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify international paper for any such tax liability.
even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss under internal revenue code ("the code") section 355 of the code, the spin-off may be taxable to international paper (but not international paper's shareholders) pursuant to section 355(e) of the code if there is a 50% or more (by vote or value) change in ownership of either international paper or spinco, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off. for this purpose, any acquisitions of international paper's or spinco's common stock within two years before or after the spin-off are presumed to be part of such a plan, although international paper or spinco may be able to rebut that presumption based on either applicable facts and circumstances or a "safe harbor" described in the u.s. income tax regulations.

the following generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. discussion of historical items in 2018, and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018, can be found in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019, filed with the sec on february 19, 2020, under part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
executive summary full-year 2020 net earnings attributable to shareholders were $482 million ($1.22 per diluted share) compared with $1.2 billion ($3.07 per diluted share) for full-year 2019.
international paper navigated the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 to deliver solid earnings and outstanding cash generation. our 2020 performance demonstrates the strength and resilience of our employees, our diverse customer base and our world class manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. we ran our manufacturing system well and leveraged the flexibility of our mill and converting systems to overcome significant challenges due to the pandemic, while managing costs extremely well across our three businesses, with no material operational disruptions due to the pandemic. we continued to grow value for our shareholders with a return above our cost of capital, which marks the eleventh consecutive year with value-creating returns. we generated full-year cash from operations of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.3 billion. given the significant economic uncertainty, we took prudent and early actions to reinforce cash generation and enhance our financial strength. we continued to execute on our capital allocation framework. in 2020, we returned $820
million to shareowners and reduced debt by $1.7 billion. we also invested in our north american and emea corrugated packaging businesses to enhance our capabilities and grow earnings. finally, in the fourth quarter, we announced plans to spin-off our printing papers business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, which we expect to complete in the third quarter 2021.
compared to 2019, the company's 2020 results reflect strong execution and effective cost management to mitigate the impact of market disruptions associated with the pandemic. price and mix were negatively affected by the full-year impact of 2019 price index movements in our north america packaging business, as well as lower average pricing in our global cellulose fibers and printing papers businesses. volume was also an earnings headwind due to the unprecedented decline in demand for printing papers related to the pandemic. these price and volume headwinds were partly offset by strong volume growth in our north american packaging business, outstanding cost management and lower maintenance outage expenses. during 2020, we made choices around planned maintenance and other spending priorities in response to market disruptions resulting from the pandemic. operating costs were higher in 2020, primarily due to higher costs in the latter part of the year, as we flexed our system to meet strong packaging demand. overall, input costs were favorable in 2020, driven by lower wood, energy and distribution costs although we did see an increase in recovered fiber, energy and distribution in the fourth quarter. equity earnings were lower in 2020 due to decreased ilim earnings, driven by the challenging global pulp markets along with a foreign exchange loss on ilim's u.s. dollar denominated net debt.
looking ahead to the first quarter 2021, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, in our industrial packaging business, we expect price and mix to improve on the realization of prior price index movement. volume is expected to be flat sequentially with continued strong box demand in north america. operations and costs are expected to improve sequentially, resulting from the non-repeat of isolated reliability issues and other unfavorable one-time items in the fourth quarter 2020. maintenance outage expense is expected to be higher along with increased input costs, mainly due to higher recovered fiber and distribution costs. in our global cellulose fibers business, we expect improved price and mix on the realization of prior price index movements. volume is expected to be stable and operations and costs are expected to improve on the non-repeat of unfavorable fourth quarter items. maintenance outage expenses are expected to decrease moderately and input costs are expected to increase on seasonally table of contents higher wood and energy costs. in our printing papers business, price and mix is expected to be stable and volume is expected to decrease, mostly due to lower seasonal demand in brazil and russia. operations and costs are expected to improve and maintenance outage expense is expected to be flat. input costs are expected to be higher, primarily due to higher seasonal wood and energy costs. lastly, for our ilim joint venture, we expect lower earnings on the non-repeat of the foreign currency gain on us denominated debt recognized in the fourth quarter 2020.
as we enter 2021, we are mindful that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic and there is still uncertainty. accordingly, we remain committed to our covid-19 principles to focus on what we need to do as a company to remain strong and resilient for all our stakeholders - to keep our employees and contractors safe, to take care of our customers and to maintain our financial strength. looking to 2021, we anticipate continued strong demand for corrugated packaging and pulp and are poised to grow earnings. we remain focused on cash generation and will continue to make choices consistent with our capital allocation framework to drive long-term value creation.
on march 11, 2020 the world health organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus ("covid-19") a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. since that time, most of our manufacturing and converting facilities have remained open and operational during the pandemic. the health and safety of our employees and contractors is our most important responsibility as we manage through the covid-19 pandemic. we have implemented work-systems across the company, including hygiene, social distancing, site cleaning, contact tracing, and other measures, as recommended by the cdc and who. our covid-19 measures are proving to be effective and we have not had any material disruptions to our operations.
we have seen a significant negative impact on demand for our printing papers products. demand for our pulp, containerboard and corrugated box products has not been negatively impacted by covid-19 to date, but our operations in industrial packaging experienced higher supply chain costs due to the impacts of covid-19. the recent resurgence of the virus in many areas has led to additional governmental measures, such as stay-at-home orders or business and school closures, negatively impacting our supply chain, and therefore our production.
there continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the covid-19 pandemic, including with respect to the various economic reopening plans and the resurgence of the virus in many areas; additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and private businesses to attempt to contain the covid-19 outbreak or to mitigate its impact; the extent and duration of social distancing and stay-at-home orders; the efficacy of various vaccines; and availability and the ongoing impact of covid-19 on unemployment, economic activity and consumer confidence. developments related to covid-19 are significantly adversely affecting portions of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly if negative global economic conditions persist for a significant period of time or deteriorate.
adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are non-gaap measures and are defined as net earnings (loss) attributable to international paper (a gaap measure) excluding net special items and non-operating pension expense (income). net earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders are the most directly comparable gaap measures. the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of non-operating pension expense (income) and items considered by management to be unusual (net special items) from the earnings reported under gaap. adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results. the company believes that using this information, along with the most direct comparable gaap measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations.

cash provided by operations totaled $3.1 billion and $3.6 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively. the company generated free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion in both 2020 and 2019. free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations. management utilizes this measure in connection with managing our business and believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, service debt and make investments for future growth. it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the company's ongoing underlying operational performance, we believe that free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods.

table of contents results of operations while the operating results for international paper's various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in international paper's operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america, europe, russia, latin america, north africa and the middle east.
factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable goods production, consumer preferences, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and location, and movements in currency exchange rates.
product prices are affected by a variety of factors including general economic trends, inventory levels, currency exchange rate movements and worldwide capacity utilization. in addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recovered fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; mill outage costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.

liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper's liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. while changes in key operating cash costs, such as raw material, energy, mill outage and distribution, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on commercial and operational excellence, as well as our ability to tightly manage costs and working capital has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.
use of cash during 2020 was primarily focused on capital spending, debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends.
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operations totaled $3.1 billion in 2020, compared with $3.6 billion for 2019. cash provided by working capital components (accounts receivable, contract assets and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other) totaled $324 million in 2020, compared with cash provided by working capital components of $342 million in 2019. cash dividends received from equity investments were $162 million in 2020, compared with $273 million in 2019.
investment activities cash outflows from investment activities in 2020 decreased from 2019, as 2019 included higher capital spending. the company made a concerted effort to control spending in 2020 and will continue to do so throughout 2021. capital spending was $751 million in 2020, or 58% of depreciation and amortization, compared with $1.3 billion in 2019, or 98% of depreciation and amortization. across our segments, capital spending as a percentage of depreciation and amortization ranged from 35.8% to 63.6% in 2020.
the following table shows capital spending by business segment for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019:

(a)reductions related to notes with interest rates ranging from 3.00% to 9.50% with original maturities from 2021 to 2048 for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019.
(b)amounts are included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
the company's early debt reductions in 2020 were comprised of debt tenders of $406 million with an interest rate of 7.50% due in 2021, $658 million with an interest rate of 3.65% due in 2024, $127 million with an interest rate of 3.80% due in 2026, and $297 million with an interest rate of 3.00% due in 2027. in table of contents addition to these debt tenders, the company had early debt extinguishments of approximately $152 million from open market repurchases related to debt with interest rates ranging from 3.00% to 4.40% and maturities dates from 2026 to 2048.
the company had debt issuances in 2020 of $583 million related primarily to the ar securitization program and international debt. in addition to the early debt reductions, the company had debt reductions of $638 million in 2020 related primarily to the ar securitization program, commercial paper, and international debt.
other financing activities during 2020 included the net issuance of approximately one million shares of treasury stock. repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $42 million, including $14 million related to shares repurchased under the company's share repurchase program. the company has repurchased 69.3 million shares at an average price of $47.17, for a total of approximately $3.3 billion, since the repurchase program began in september 2013 through december 31, 2020. the company paid cash dividends totaling $806 million during 2020.
other financing activities during 2019 included the net repurchase of approximately 8.5 million shares of treasury stock, including restricted stock tax withholding. repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $535 million, including $485 million related to shares repurchased under the company's share repurchase program. the company paid cash dividends totaling $796 million during 2019.
interest rate swaps our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. to manage this risk, international paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt. during the first quarter of 2020, international paper terminated its interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $700 million and maturities ranging from 2024 to 2026 with an approximate fair value of $85 million. subsequent to the termination of the interest rate swaps, the fair value basis adjustment is amortized to earnings as interest income over the same period as a debt premium on the previously hedged debt (see note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 73 through 77 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). at december 31, 2019 the company had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $700 million and during 2019, the inclusion of the offsetting interest income from short term investments reduced the effective interest rate from 4.8% to 4.4%.
variable interest entities information concerning variable interest entities is set forth in note 15 variable interest entities on pages 70 through 72 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. in connection with the 2006 international paper installment sale of forestlands, we received $4.8 billion of installment notes. these installment notes were used by variable interest entities as collateral for borrowings from third-party lenders. these variable interest entities were restructured in 2015 when the installment notes and third-party loans were extended. the restructured variable interest entities hold installment notes of $4.8 billion that mature in august 2021 and third-party loans of $4.2 billion, which, as a result of an extension in november 2020, mature in august 2021. these installment notes and third-party loans are shown in current nonrecourse financial assets of variable interest entities and current nonrecourse financial liabilities of variable interest entities, respectively, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. we will settle the third-party loans at their maturity in august 2021 with the proceeds from the installment notes which also mature in august 2021 resulting in expected cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 billion representing our equity in the variable interest entities. maturity of the installment notes and termination of the monetization structure is expected to result in a $75 million cash tax payment in 2021.
liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2021
we expect another year of solid cash generation in 2021. furthermore, we intend to continue to make choices for the use of cash that are consistent with our capital allocation framework to drive long-term value creation. these include maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, returning meaningful cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and making organic investments to maintain our world-class system and strengthen our packaging business.
under our share repurchase program most recently approved by our board of directors on october 9, 2018, which does not have an expiration date, approximately $1.73 billion aggregate amount of shares of common stock remains authorized for purchase under this program. we may continue to repurchase shares under such authorization in open market transactions (including block trades), privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, restrictions in our debt documents, applicable securities laws requirements and other factors. in addition, we pay regular quarterly cash dividends and expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
table of contents each quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors, and is subject to restrictions in our debt documents.
capital expenditures and long-term debt capital spending for 2021 is planned at approximately $800 million, or about 61% of depreciation and amortization.
at december 31, 2020, international paper's credit agreements totaled $2.8 billion, which is comprised of the $750 million contractually committed revolving credit agreement, the $1.5 billion contractually committed bank credit agreement, and up to $550 million under the receivables securitization program. management believes these credit agreements are adequate to cover expected operating cash flow variability during the current economic cycle. the credit agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a pre-determined margin dependent upon international paper's credit rating. at december 31, 2020, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the $750 million revolving credit agreement, the $1.5 billion credit agreement, or the $550 million receivables securitization program. the company's credit agreements are not subject to any restrictive covenants other than the financial covenants as disclosed on pages 72 and 73 in note 16 - debt and lines of credit of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, and the borrowings under the receivables securitization program being limited by eligible receivables. the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31, 2020 and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in the credit agreements. further the financial covenants do not restrict any borrowings under the credit agreements. after considering the company's liquidity position in relation to covid-19 and the current economic environment, the company's receivable securitization program was amended from a committed financing arrangement to an uncommitted financing arrangement in february 2021 with the borrowing limit and expiration date remaining unchanged."
in addition to the $2.8 billion in credit agreements, international paper has a commercial paper program with a borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion. under the terms of the program, individual maturities on borrowings may vary, but not exceed one year from the date of issue. interest bearing notes may be issued either as fixed or floating rate notes. the company had no borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2020, and $30 million of borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2019, under this program.
international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt and meet working capital and dividend requirements for the next 12 months with current cash balances and cash from operations, supplemented as required by its existing credit facilities. the company will continue to rely on debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives. the primary goals of the company's capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and maintain appropriate levels of liquidity to meet our needs while managing balance sheet debt and interest expense. the majority of international paper's debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors. during 2020, management took various actions to further strengthen the company's liquidity position in response to the covid-19 pandemic. this included the company amending its receivable securitization program from an uncommitted financing arrangement to a committed financing arrangement in april 2020 and also deferring the payment of our payroll taxes as allowed under cares act. the cares act allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer portion of social security taxes accrued between march 27, 2020, and december 31, 2020. under the cares act 50% of the deferred payroll taxes will be paid by december 31, 2021 and the remainder will be paid by december 31, 2022. we believe that our credit agreements, commercial paper program, and the actions taken in response to covid-19 provide us with sufficient liquidity to operate in this uncertain environment; however, an extended period of economic disruption could impact our access to additional sources of liquidity.
maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper's financing strategy. at december 31, 2020, the company held long-term credit ratings of bbb (stable outlook) and baa2 (stable outlook) by s&p and moody's, respectively.
contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31, 2020, were as follows:

(b)not included in the above table due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $163 million. also not included in the above table is $117 million of deemed repatriation transition tax associated with the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act which will be settled from 2021 - 2026.
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2020, to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no u.s. income taxes have been provided thereon (see note 13 income taxes on pages 65 through 68 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.
the company expects significant cash generation through various transactions in 2021 including the sale of the kwidzyn, poland mill, further monetization of our investment in graphic packaging, the printing papers spin-off, the unwind of the 2005 timber monetization structure and the sale of its ownership interest in olmuksan international paper. we will deploy this cash in a manner consistent with our capital allocation framework by maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders and investing in opportunities that generate returns above our cost of capital and grow earnings and cash.
pension obligations and funding at december 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation for the company's u.s. defined benefit plans determined under u.s. gaap was approximately $1.0 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets, excluding non-u.s. plans. approximately $595 million of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. under current irs funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits (the "projected benefit obligation") for accounting purposes. in december 2008, the worker, retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 ("wera") was passed by the u.s. congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections. funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company, and the timing of its implementation, as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected not to make any voluntary contributions in 2018, 2019 or 2020. at this time, we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2021, although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. the timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
ilim shareholder's agreement in october 2007, in connection with the formation of the ilim joint venture, international paper entered into a shareholder's agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners. this agreement provides that at any time, either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock agreement. if these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholder's agreement are commenced, although it is not obligated to do so, the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners' 50% interest in ilim. any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities. based on the provisions of the agreement, the company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners' 50% interests would be approximately $700 million, which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock, or some combination of the two, at the company's option. the purchase by the company of its partners' 50% interest in ilim would result in the consolidation of ilim's financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods. the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions of the shareholder's agreement.
critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper, and that can require judgments by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and income taxes. the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of table of contents the company's board of directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm.
while we have taken into account certain impacts arising from covid-19 in connection with the accounting estimates reflected in this annual report on form 10-k, the full impact of covid-19 is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. however, we have made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. to the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements may be affected.
contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities, including personal injury, product liability, environmental, asbestos and other legal matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical litigation and settlement experience and recommendations of legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. liabilities for asbestos-related matters require reviews of recent and historical claims data. the company utilizes its in-house legal and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal, environmental and asbestos obligations, supplemented as needed by third-party specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities.
we calculate our workers' compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors. the workers' compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure. while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the ultimate settlement of workers' compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements.
impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows from future operations or disposals. a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. additionally, evaluation for possible impairment of goodwill is required annually. the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments may require the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management's best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets. as these key factors change in future periods, the company will update its impairment analysis to reflect its latest estimates and projections.
asu 2011-08, "intangibles - goodwill and other," allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. if a qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test unless the entity determines that, based on that qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value.
the company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test for its north america industrial packaging, emea industrial packaging, european papers, russian papers, and brazilian papers reporting units as of october 1, 2020. the company elected to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for its reporting units due to the current economic environment. the quantitative goodwill impairment test was performed by comparing the carrying amount of each respective reporting unit to its estimated fair value. the company calculated the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units with goodwill using a weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. the determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, operating profit margins, and discount rates. the determination of fair value using market multiples and transaction multiples requires management to make significant assumptions related to revenue multiples and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda") multiples. the results of our annual impairment test indicated that the carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of any reporting units. for our emea packaging reporting unit, the fair value exceeded the carrying amount by 13%. while the reporting unit's forecasted results support the fair value, significant changes in or inability to achieve the forecasts could result in the impairment of all or a portion of the reporting unit's $70 million goodwill balance as of december 31, 2020. while the printing papers table of contents segment has experienced a significant decline in demand for its products in the current year as a result of covid-19, the company has determined the fair values for those reporting units have not been materially impacted based on management's cumulative long-term outlook and forecasts, which are inherently subjective given the uncertainty around the duration and magnitude of the economic impact of covid-19. currently all of our printing papers reporting units fair values exceed carrying values by more than 85%.
in addition, the company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation. in consideration of all relevant factors, there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to october 1, 2020.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments, the company calculated the estimated fair value of the global cellulose fibers reporting unit, and it was determined that all of the goodwill in the reporting unit, totaling $52 million, was impaired. this impairment charge was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019. the decline in the fair value of global cellulose fibers and resulting impairment charge was due to a change in the outlook of the global cellulose fibers reporting unit's operations.
pension benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper's consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases and mortality rates.
the calculations of pension obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities.
benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31, 2020, for international paper's pension plan were as follows:
in millions                              benefit   fair value of obligation   plan assets u.s. qualified pension             $12,613         $12,018
u.s. nonqualified pension              407         -
non-u.s. pension                       264                 190
the table below shows the discount rate used by international paper to calculate u.s. pension obligations for the years shown:
2020                                      2019          2018
discount rate           2.60   %      3.40   %      4.30   %
international paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on december 31 of each year or more frequently if required, to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan's investment portfolio. the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.
the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31, 2020 was 7.00%.
increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets by an additional 0.25% would decrease (increase) 2021 pension expense by approximately $28 million, while a (decrease) increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately $27 million.
actual rates of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:
year         return        year         return
2020      24.7    %        2015       1.3    %
2019      23.9    %        2014       6.4    %
2018     (3.0)    %        2013      14.1    %
2017      19.3    %        2012      14.1    %
2016       7.1    %        2011       2.5    %
the 2012, 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and temple-inland asset returns. international paper and temple-inland assets were combined in october 2014. the annualized time-weighted rate of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets was 13.9% and 10.7% for the past five and ten years, respectively.
asc 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense

table of contents prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years.
net periodic pension plan expenses, calculated for all of international paper's plans, were as follows:
in millions                  2020        2019          2018          2017          2016
pension expense u.s. plans                $32         $93          $632          $717          $809
non-u.s. plans              5           6             4             5             4
net expense               $37         $99          $636          $722          $813
the decrease in 2020 pension expense primarily reflects a higher return on assets and lower interest costs slightly offset by higher service cost.
assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31, 2020, projected future net periodic pension plan expense (income) would be as follows:
in millions                      2022            2021
pension expense (income)
u.s. plans                       $(181)          $(114)
non-u.s. plans                   4                       5
net (income) expense             $(177)          $(109)
the company estimates that it will record net pension income of approximately $114 million for its u.s. defined benefit plans in 2021, compared to expense of $32 million in 2020. the estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2021 is primarily due to higher return on assets, lower interest cost and lower amortization of actuarial losses partially offset by higher service cost.
the market value of plan assets for international paper's u.s. qualified pension plan at december 31, 2020 totaled approximately $12.0 billion, consisting of approximately 40% equity securities, 48% debt securities, 7% real estate funds and 5% other assets. the company's funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the company, and other factors. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. there were no required contributions to the u.s. qualified plan in 2020. the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled $31 million for the year ended december 31, 2020.
income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the company's evaluation of the "more likely than not" outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.
while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.
legal proceedings information concerning the company's environmental and legal proceedings is set forth in note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 68 through 70 of item  8. financial statements and supplementary data.
recent accounting developments see note 2 recent accounting developments on pages 54 and 55 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
effect of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood fiber and chemical costs, have an impact on the company's operating results, changes in general inflation have had minimal impact table of contents on our operating results in each of the last three years. sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors.
foreign currency effects international paper has operations in a number of countries. its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with, imports from other regions. as such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company's financial statements. direct impacts include the translation of international operations' local currency financial statements into u.s. dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the united states (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). in general, a weaker u.s. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper. the currencies that have the most impact are the euro, the brazilian real, the polish zloty and the russian ruble.
market risk we use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. information related to international paper's debt obligations is included in note 16 debt and lines of credit on pages 72 and 73 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 73 through 77 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. we invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. our investments in marketable securities at december 31, 2020 and 2019 are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.
we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions. derivative instruments, such as, interest rate swaps, may be used to execute this strategy. at december 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $9.3 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively. the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately $443 million and $511 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
commodity price risk the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. at both december 31, 2020 and 2019, the net fair value of these contracts was immaterial and the potential loss in fair value from a 10% adverse change in quoted commodity prices for these contracts was also immaterial.
foreign currency risk international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts. at december 31, 2020 and 2019, the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a $3 million liability and a $16 million asset, respectively. the table of contents potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately $26 million and $87 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

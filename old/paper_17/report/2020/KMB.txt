item 1a.    risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us.
business operations we face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks. the ongoing covid-19 pandemic could have negative impacts on our business, including causing significant volatility in demand for our products, changes in consumer behavior and preference, disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain operations, disruptions to our cost saving programs and restructuring initiatives, limitations on our employees' ability to work and travel, significant changes in the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate and related currency and commodity volatility. despite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.
cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could disrupt our business operations and cause us financial and reputational damage.
increased cyber-security threats and computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations regarding the handling of personal data, such as the general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act. any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, supplier, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. any such event, or any failure to comply with these data privacy requirements or other laws in this area, could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in legal liability, or regulatory or other penalties. in addition, we may incur large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2020 annual report our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business. these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. the risk of cyber-based attacks is heightened with many of our employees working and accessing our technology infrastructure remotely as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.
significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation or other necessary supplies or services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results.
increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, supplier consolidation which could limit our sources of supply for these items, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in past years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. in some instances, we utilize negotiated short-term contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility, but we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks.
a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products and disposable wipes, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials.
our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources.
there can be no assurance that our efforts to increase selling prices in response to increased costs will be successful.
our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results.
our strategy includes operations growth outside the u.s., especially in developing markets such as china, eastern europe, asean and latin america. about half of our net sales come from markets outside the u.s. we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 34 countries and sell products in a substantial majority of countries around the world. our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks:
•exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts where available and economically advantageous. we do not generally hedge our income statement translation exposure with respect to foreign operations.
•increases in currency exchange restrictions. these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. or obtain currency exchange for u.s. dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries.
•adverse political conditions. risks related to political instability, expropriation, new or revised legal or regulatory constraints, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax kimberly-clark corporation - 2020 annual report consequences, including the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union (brexit) and the related ongoing negotiations with the european union, could adversely affect our financial results.
•increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations.
the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") and item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of highly inflationary accounting in argentina.
damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business.
developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management), inclusion and diversity, human rights and other sustainability or similar matters, or breaches of consumer, customer, supplier, employee or other confidential information, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. in addition, our products could face withdrawal, recall or other quality issues. consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity, potentially with negative perception of our products or brands. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination, or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.
disruption in our supply chain or our manufacturing or distribution operations could adversely affect our business.
our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, epidemics, pandemics (including the ongoing covid-19 pandemic), import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address.
in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our suppliers, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.
there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.
we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist. in january 2018, we announced a global restructuring program. the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees, suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results.
we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses, which could impact our results.
we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties, including our recent acquisition of softex indonesia. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future, or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2020 annual report we may periodically divest product lines or businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses. furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products.
the inability to effectively and efficiently manage acquisitions and divestitures with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
marketing and competition increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business.
our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and e-tailers. with the consolidation of retail trade, both traditional retailers and e-tailers, we are increasingly dependent on key customers, and some of these customers, including large-format retailers and large e-tailers, may have significant bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory destocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
intense competition for sales of our products, changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, a growing e-commerce marketplace, and customers' and competitors' actions. our competitors for these markets include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers. some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. e-commerce potentially intensifies competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, which could adversely affect our financial results.
we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products. demand for our products may change based on many factors, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products and mid to lower-tier value products, low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, negative consumer response to pricing actions, consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to e-tailers, changing consumer preferences due to increased concerns in regard to post-consumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability, or other changes in consumer trends or habits. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease.
our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. also, if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights, we may be less competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2020 annual report legal and regulatory government regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
as a global company, we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-bribery or anti-corruption, product liability, environmental, intellectual property or other matters, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions.
if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures, and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image.
in addition, new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business, including in connection with brexit, which could adversely impact our financial results. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance, or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs, excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials.
new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies, including tax reform in the u.s. that was enacted in december 2017. other jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this md&a is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and prospects. this discussion and analysis compares 2020 results to 2019. for a discussion that compares our 2019 results to 2018, see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7 of our 2019 annual report on form 10-k. the reference to "n.m." indicates that the calculation is not meaningful. in addition, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix and net selling prices on net sales. changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions also impact the year-over-year change in net sales. dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.
the following will be discussed and analyzed:
•overview of business
•overview of 2020 results
•impact of covid-19
•results of operations and related information
•unaudited quarterly data
•liquidity and capital resources
•critical accounting policies and use of estimates
•new accounting standards
•information concerning forward-looking statements throughout this md&a, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., or gaap, and are therefore referred to as non-gaap financial measures. these measures include adjusted gross and operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted other (income) and expense, net, and adjusted effective tax rate. we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management.
non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable gaap measures, and they should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.  there are limitations to these non-gaap financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded.  we compensate for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as a supplement to the gaap measures and by providing reconciliations of the non-gaap and comparable gaap financial measures.
the non-gaap financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this md&a:
•2018 global restructuring program - in 2018, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. see item 8, note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•softex indonesia acquisition-related costs - transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of softex indonesia. see item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•brazil business tax credits - in the fourth quarter of 2020, we received a favorable legal ruling that resolved certain matters related to prior years' business taxes in brazil. see item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•property sale gain - in the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized a gain on the sale of property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed in 2012 as part of a past restructuring.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2020 annual report overview of business we are a global company focused on leading the world in essentials for a better life, with manufacturing facilities in 34 countries, including our equity affiliates, and products sold in more than 175 countries and territories. our products are sold under well-known brands such as kleenex, scott, huggies, pull-ups, kotex and depend. we have three reportable business segments: personal care, consumer tissue and k-c professional. these business segments are described in greater detail in item 8, note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
in operating our business, we seek to:
•grow our portfolio of brands through innovation, category development and commercial execution,
•leverage our cost and financial discipline to fund growth and improve margins, and
•allocate capital in value-creating ways.
we describe our business outside north america in two groups - developing and emerging markets ("d&e") and developed markets. d&e markets comprise eastern europe, the middle east and africa, latin america and asia-pacific, excluding australia and south korea. developed markets consist of western and central europe, australia and south korea.
on october 1, 2020, we acquired softex indonesia, a leader in the fast-growing indonesian personal care market, in an all-cash transaction for approximately $1.2 billion. this transaction significantly expands our presence in an important d&e market and is a strong strategic fit with our core business. softex indonesia generated net sales of approximately $420 in 2019. we financed the transaction through a combination of short-term commercial paper, cash on hand and the issuance of a $600 bond. see item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
overview of 2020 results
•net sales of $19.1 billion increased 4 percent. organic sales increased 6 percent. changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by 2 percent.
•in north america, organic sales increased 10 percent in consumer products and decreased 5 percent in k-c professional.
•outside north america, organic sales increased 3 percent in d&e markets and 6 percent in developed markets.
•operating profit and net income attributable to kimberly-clark were $3,244 and $2,352 in 2020, respectively.
•diluted earnings per share were $6.87 in 2020 compared to $6.24 in 2019. results in 2020 and 2019 include net charges of $0.94 and $0.72, respectively, related to the 2018 global restructuring program. results in 2020 also include acquisition-related costs of $0.08 associated with the acquisition of softex indonesia and a benefit of $0.15 related to the resolution of certain business tax matters in brazil. results in 2019 also include a net gain of $0.07 related to the sale of property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed as part of a past restructuring.
•we continue to focus on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders. cash provided by operations was $3.7 billion in 2020. we raised our dividend in 2020 by 4 percent, the 48th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. altogether, share repurchases and dividends in 2020 amounted to $2.15 billion.
in 2021, we plan to continue to execute our strategies for long-term success which include delivering balanced, sustainable growth by growing our brands in-line with or ahead of category growth, leveraging our cost and financial discipline to fund growth and improve margins, and allocating capital in value-creating ways. our growth strategy is built on two pillars. elevate our core business is our first pillar and is driven by delivering value-added innovations and driving category opportunities. accelerating growth in d&e markets is our second pillar and emphasizes personal care and k-c professional with latin america, china, eastern europe and asean as our priority markets. both strategies are enabled by our focus on accelerating and investing in our commercial capabilities through digital marketing, revenue growth management, consumer-inspired innovation and strong in-market execution.
our strong legacy of financial discipline supports our growth strategy by driving ongoing supply chain productivity through our force (focused on reducing costs everywhere) program, completing the execution of the 2018 global restructuring program, controlling discretionary spending, driving down working capital and maintaining the top-tier return on invested kimberly-clark corporation - 2020 annual report capital. our capital allocation strategy is consistent with our historical approach of disciplined capital spending, payment of a top tier dividend, evaluation of acquisition opportunities and allocation of excess cash flow to share repurchases.
we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which can affect our business operations and financial results. see item 1a, "risk factors" in this form 10-k for additional information.
impact of covid-19
we continue to actively address the covid-19 situation and its impact globally. we believe that we will emerge from these events well positioned for long-term growth, though we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this global pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our business and results.
we have experienced increased volatility in demand for some of our products as consumers adapt to the evolving environment. beginning in the first quarter of 2020, particularly in march, demand increased in our consumer tissue and personal care business segments across all major geographies as consumers increased home inventory levels in response to covid-19. the increase was followed by a period of demand softness as consumers used existing home inventories and demand returned to more normal levels. demand for our consumer tissue products was elevated throughout 2020 as more people spent more time at home. our k-c professional business experienced volume declines throughout 2020 reflecting the reduction in away from home demand.
during 2020, we experienced temporary closures of certain facilities, though we did not experience a material impact from a plant closure and our facilities were largely exempt or partially exempt from government closure orders. at many of our facilities, we have been experiencing increased employee absences, which may continue in the current situation.
during 2020, we also experienced increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, as certain countries experienced increased macro-economic volatility from the covid-19 situation.

•the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily superabsorbent materials, pulp and utilities. although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.
•the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts for goods and services we have negotiated for delivery.
the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain. the following payments are not included in the table:
•we will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately $50 to these plans in 2021.
•other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately $50 through 2030.
•accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests.
investing our capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020 and 2019, including incremental spending related to the 2018 global restructuring program. acquisition, net of cash acquired of $1.1 billion in 2020 reflected the purchase of softex indonesia.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2020 annual report proceeds from dispositions of property in 2019 of $242 primarily reflects the proceeds from the sales of manufacturing facilities and associated real estate related to the 2018 global restructuring program and property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed as part of a past restructuring. we expect capital spending to be approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in 2021, including spending associated with the 2018 global restructuring program and other growth initiatives.
financing we issue long-term debt in the public market periodically. proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness. see item 8, note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
our short-term debt, which consists of u.s. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-u.s. subsidiaries, was $223 as of december 31, 2020 (included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet). the average month-end balance of short-term debt for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020 was $365. these short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations. the level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions, dividends and income taxes.
at december 31, 2020, total debt was $8.4 billion compared to $7.7 billion at december 31, 2019.
we maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in june 2023 and a $750 revolving credit facility which expires in june 2021. these facilities, currently unused, support our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason.
in july 2017, the united kingdom's financial conduct authority, which regulates the london interbank offered rate (libor), announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021. we are currently evaluating the potential effect of the eventual replacement of the libor, but we do not expect the effect to be material. accounting guidance has been issued to ease the transition to alternative reference rates from a financial reporting perspective. see item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
we paid $1.5 billion in dividends in 2020. the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 6.5 percent for 2021. we repurchase shares of kimberly-clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. during 2020, we repurchased 4.9 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $700 through a broker in the open market. we are targeting full-year 2021 share repurchases between $650 and $750, subject to market conditions. on january 22, 2021, the corporation's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program, pursuant to which the corporation is authorized to repurchase up to 40 million shares of the corporation's common stock, subject to a limit of $5 billion in aggregate expenditures. the authorization is incremental to the remaining shares available to be repurchased under the current share repurchase program authorized on november 13, 2014.
we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, payments for our 2018 global restructuring program, capital spending, pension contributions, dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future. further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the u.s. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2020 annual report critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments. these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
sales incentives and trade promotion allowances trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales. promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs. generally, the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories, and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized. our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
employee postretirement benefits substantially all regular employees in the u.s. and the united kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain u.s. and united kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit (the "principal plans"). certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8, note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations:
•long-term rate of return on plan assets. the expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. in setting these assumptions, we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the target asset allocation. actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate.
as of december 31, 2020, the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $1.1 billion. these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, and whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the "corridor" as required. if the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2021.
•discount rate. the discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future u.s. pension obligation at december 31, 2020 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan. for the united kingdom plan, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities. each year's expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations. if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2021, and the december 31, 2020 pension liability would increase by about $146.
•other assumptions. there are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations, primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2020 annual report pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $85 in 2021, including incremental charges resulting from 2018 global restructuring program actions. pension expense beyond 2021 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans.
substantially all u.s. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate:
•discount rate. the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above, and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that country's pension obligation. if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the impact to 2021 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the december 31, 2020 benefit liability would not be material.
•health care cost trend rate. the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace.
deferred income taxes and potential assessments as a global organization, we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results, particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the u.s. and uncertain tax positions. our income tax related accounting policies, account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8, note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
•deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. we have recorded deferred tax assets related to, among other matters, income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. these carryforwards are primarily in non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the u.s. foreign tax credits earned in the u.s. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
•undistributed earnings. as of december 31, 2020, we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $7.9 billion. earnings of $5.2 billion were previously subject to tax, primarily due to the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings required by the tax cuts and jobs act.  any additional taxes due with respect to such previously-taxed earnings, if repatriated, would generally be limited to foreign and u.s. state income taxes. deferred taxes have been recorded on $0.7 billion of earnings, most of which were previously taxed for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated.  we do not intend to distribute the remaining $4.5 billion of previously taxed foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and u.s. state income taxes on such earnings.  while the transition tax resulted in a reduction of the excess amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, any remaining amount of financial reporting over tax basis after such reduction could be subject to additional taxes, if repatriated.  however, we consider any excess to be indefinitely reinvested.  the determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the $4.5 billion of previously taxed foreign earnings is not practicable.
•uncertain tax positions. we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate. where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2020 annual report goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 10 to 20 years. we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to measure the acquisition date fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired.
events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares, increased competition or loss of market share, obsolescence, product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life, deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results.
our related accounting policies and our acquisition of softex indonesia are discussed in item 8, notes 1 and 3, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill in our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors such as macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environments, historical and projected financial performance, significant changes in the reporting unit and the magnitude of excess fair value over carrying amount from the previous quantitative impairment testing. if the result of a qualitative test indicates a potential for impairment, a quantitative test is performed. when a quantitative test is considered necessary, estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model and a market-based approach. we use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and earnings. the other key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow include, but are not limited to, discount rates, actual business trends experienced, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, inflation and terminal growth rates.
for 2020, we completed the required annual assessment of goodwill for impairment for all of our reporting units using a qualitative assessment as of the first day of the third quarter, and we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than the carrying amount for each of our reporting units.
other intangible assets we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, primarily brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model and a market-based approach using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. the cash flows used in the discounted cash flow model are consistent with those we use in our internal planning, which gives consideration to actual business trends experienced and the long-term business strategy.
we performed our 2020 impairment assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the third quarter of 2020, and based upon a qualitative assessment, no impairment indicators were found to be present.

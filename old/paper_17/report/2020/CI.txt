item 1a. risk factors as a large global health service company operating in a complex industry, we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or the trading price of our securities. you should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, together with other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, including management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us. the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use; however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance.
strategic and operational risks future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational initiatives effectively.
the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to effectively implement and execute our strategic and operational initiatives. successfully executing on these initiatives depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:
•differentiate our products, services and solutions from those of our competitors;
•develop, introduce and partner to bring forward new and innovative products, solutions or programs that focus on improving patient outcomes and assist in controlling costs or are in response to government regulation and the increased focus on consumer-directed products;
•develop and create data and analytic solutions to support and improve outcomes for our products, services and solutions, including creating and developing solutions and services through partnerships with other industry participants;
•grow our product portfolio, expand our addressable markets and identify and introduce the proper mix, coordination or integration of products that will be accepted by the marketplace;
•evaluate drugs for efficacy, value and price to assist clients in selecting a cost-effective formulary;
•offer cost-effective home delivery pharmacy and specialty services;
•access or continue accessing key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories in our specialty pharmacy business;
•leverage purchase volume to deliver discounts to health benefit providers;
•attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees;
•attract, develop and maintain collaborative relationships with a sufficient number of qualified partners;
•attract new and maintain existing customer and client relationships;
•transition health care providers from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based system;
•improve medical cost competitiveness in our targeted markets;
•manage our medical, pharmacy, administrative and other operating costs effectively; and
•contract with health care providers, pharmacy providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers on favorable terms.
for our strategic initiatives to succeed, we must effectively collaborate across our operations, integrate our acquired businesses, actively work to ensure consistency throughout the organization and promote a global mind-set along with a focus on individual customers and clients. if we fail to do so, our business may be unable to grow as planned, or the result of expansion may be unsatisfactory. we will be unable to rapidly respond to competitive, economic and regulatory changes if we do not make important strategic and operational decisions quickly, define our appetite for risk, implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes smoothly and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly. if these initiatives fail or are not executed effectively, our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be negatively affected.
we operate in a highly competitive, evolving and rapidly changing industry and our failure to adapt could negatively impact our business.
the health service industry continues to be dynamic and rapidly evolving. any significant shifts in the structure of the industry could alter industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients and customers. industry shifts could result (and have resulted) from, among other things:
•a large intra- or inter-industry merger or industry consolidation;
•strategic alliances;
•new or alternative business models or new government options or offerings;
•continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, as well as changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians, hospitals and health care providers;
•new market entrants, including those not traditionally in the health service industry;
•the ability of larger employers and clients to contract directly with providers;
•technological changes and rapid shifts in the use of technology, such as telehealth;
•the impact or consequences of legislation or regulatory changes;
•changes in the united states postal service or the consolidation of shipping carriers;
•increased drug acquisition cost or unexpected changes to drug pricing trend;
•changes in the generic drug market or the failure of new generic drugs to come to market; or
•changes in utilization of health care, prescription drugs or other covered services and items, including under risk-based contracts in the health benefit management market and for those businesses that utilize risk adjustment methodology.
our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
the scale, scope and duration of the covid-19 pandemic continues to be unknown and the overall impact on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition has been and may continue to be material.
the covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected global economies, financial markets and the overall environment for our business, and the extent to which it may impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.
the covid-19 pandemic has in some instances, and may continue to, heighten the potential adverse effects on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition as described below or in other risk factors within this section of the form 10-k including, but not limited to, the likelihood of and impact from:
•unfavorable economic conditions on our clients and customers (both employers and individuals), health care providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacy providers and third-party vendors, as well as federal and state entities and programs;
•changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns or procedures; changes in customer base and product mix; changes in utilization of prescription drugs, medical or other covered items or services, including increased behavioral health services utilization; changes in medical cost trends; changes in our health management practices; and the introduction of new benefits and products causing actual claims to exceed our estimates;
•changes in health care utilization patterns, provider billing practices and other external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control impacting our ability to accurately predict, price for and manage health care costs and ultimately our profitability, including impacts from care deferral on, among other things, risk adjustment revenue and acuity of future care;
•increased costs or reductions in revenue, including costs for covid-19-related care, testing and treatment and related cost-share waivers for our customers; vaccine and other coverage mandates; and support for employees, clients, customers and providers;
•significant disruptions in service within our operations or among our key suppliers or other third parties, including decreased worker productivity and operational and sales disruptions, including as a result of remote working arrangements, increased medical, emergency or other leave, quarantines, government actions or restrictions;
•compliance with substantial government regulation, including privacy and security requirements associated with providing telehealth and remote care options for individuals and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, such as vaccine and coverage mandates and premium deferrals, which laws or regulations may vary significantly by jurisdiction;
•prioritization of matters relating to covid-19 resulting in delays in responsiveness by regulatory agencies and other third parties in matters arising in the ordinary course of business;
•cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents, including as a result of the transition to a remote work environment by substantially all of our workforce and the workforces of third parties with whom we contract;
•significant shifts in the structure of the industry which could alter dynamics and, if we fail to adapt, negatively impact our business;
•risks inherent in foreign operations, including political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks;
•economic and market conditions affecting the value of our financial instruments and the value of particular assets and liabilities; and
•fluctuations in equity market prices, interest rates and credit spreads limiting our ability to raise or deploy capital and affecting our overall liquidity.
additionally, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if our clients or customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.
we believe covid-19's adverse impact on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition will be driven primarily by the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the impact of the breadth and timing of implementation and the efficacy and costs of vaccination programs, the pandemic's impact on our employees, clients, customers, suppliers and partners, as well as the u.s.
and global economies and the continued actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. those primary drivers are largely beyond our knowledge and control, and may be more adverse than our current expectations. given these uncertainties, we cannot estimate the full impact covid-19 will have on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition, but the adverse impact could be material.
our failure to compete effectively, to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors and maintain or increase market share could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we operate in a highly competitive environment and an industry subject to significant market pressures brought about by customer and client needs, legislative and regulatory developments and other market factors. in particular markets, our competitors may have greater, better or more established capabilities, resources, market share, reputation or business relationships, or lower profit margin or financial return expectations. our clients are well informed and organized and can easily move between our competitors and us. our express scripts client contracts generally have three-year terms and may be subject to periodic renegotiation of pricing terms based on market factors. as described in greater detail in the description of our business in item 1 of this form 10-k, one of our key clients in the evernorth segment is the united states department of defense. if one or more of our large clients terminates or does not renew a contract for any reason, including as a result of being acquired, or if the provisions of a contract with a large client are modified, renewed or otherwise changed with terms less favorable to us, our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could experience a negative reaction in the investment community resulting in decreases in the trading price of our securities or other adverse effects.
our success depends, in part, on our ability to compete effectively in our markets, set prices appropriately in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, increase customers as planned, differentiate our business offerings by innovating and delivering products and services that provide enhanced value to our customers, provide quality and satisfactory levels of service and retain accounts with favorable medical cost experience or more profitable products versus retaining or increasing our customer base in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience or less profitable products.
we must remain competitive to attract new customers, retain existing customers and further integrate additional product and service offerings. to succeed in this highly competitive marketplace, it is imperative that we maintain a strong reputation. the negative reputational impact of a significant event, including a failure to execute on customer or client contracts or strategic or operational initiatives, failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or failure to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate greater value to our customers, could affect our ability to grow and retain profitable arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we face price competition and other pressures that could compress our margins or result in premiums that are insufficient to cover the cost of services delivered to our customers.
while we compete on the basis of many service and quality-related factors, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. our client contracts are subject to negotiation as clients seek to contain their costs, including by reducing benefits offered. increasingly, our clients seek to negotiate performance guarantees that require us to pay penalties if the guaranteed performance standard is not met. clients can easily move between our competitors and us. our clients are well informed and typically have knowledgeable consultants that seek competing bids from our competitors before contract renewal. in addition, as brokers and benefit consultants seek to enhance their revenue streams, they look to take on services that we typically provide. each of these events could negatively impact our financial results.
federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict or prevent entirely our ability to implement changes in premium rates. fiscal or other concerns related to the government-sponsored programs in which we participate, such as medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans, may cause decreasing reimbursement rates, delays in premium payments, restrictions on implementing changes in premium rates or insufficient increases in reimbursement rates. any limitation on our ability to maintain or increase our premium or reimbursement levels, or a significant loss of customers or clients resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
premiums in the u.s. medical segment are generally set for one-year periods and are priced well in advance of the date on which the contract commences or renews. our revenue on medicare advantage plans, individual and family plans ("ifp") and medicare part d plans is based on rates and bids submitted midyear in the year before the contract year. although we base the premiums we charge and our medicare advantage, ifp and medicare part d rates and bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the contract period, actual costs may exceed what we estimate in setting premiums. our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control, including changes in regulations, as well as provider billing practices and changes in customers' health care utilization patterns, which may, among other things, impact our ability to appropriately document their health conditions. our participation in health insurance exchanges through our ifp offerings involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accurately predict, price for and effectively manage future health care costs. relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenue can result in significant changes in our financial results.
strong competition within the pharmacy benefit business has also generated greater demand for lower product and service pricing, increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings. these competitive factors have historically applied pressure on our operating margins and caused many companies, including us, to reduce the prices charged for products and services while sharing with clients a greater portion of the formulary fees and related rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. our inability to maintain positive trends, or failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients or sell additional services, which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
the reserves we hold for expected medical claims are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially adversely affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to contain future costs may be limited.
we maintain and record medical claims reserves on our balance sheet for estimated future payments. our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors, including historical claim experience, but this estimation process requires extensive judgment. considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns or procedures, changes in customer base and product mix, changes in the utilization of prescription drugs, medical or other covered items or services, changes in medical cost trends, changes in our health management practices, changes in regulations and the introduction of new benefits and products. if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited. additionally, we must estimate the amount of rebates payable by us under the aca's and cms' minimum loss ratio rules and the amounts payable by us to, and receivable by us from, the united states federal government under the aca's remaining premium stabilization program. because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing reserves which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health service providers and with producers and consultants, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
we contract with or employ physicians, hospitals and other health service providers and facilities to provide health services to our customers. our results of operations are substantially dependent on our ability to contract for these services at competitive prices. in any particular market, physicians, hospitals and health service providers may enter into exclusive arrangements with competitors or simply refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or less desirable products or services for our customers. in some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations and multispecialty physician groups, may have significant or controlling market positions that could result in a diminished bargaining position for us. if providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially adversely affected. additionally, certain regulations may impact our ability to obtain competitive prices. establishing collaborative arrangements with physician groups, specialist groups, independent practice associations, hospitals and health care delivery systems is key to our strategic focus to transition from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based health care system. if such collaborative arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements, or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors, our attractiveness to customers may be reduced and our ability to profitably grow our business may be adversely affected.
our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with providers may also be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us, such as changes in medicare or medicaid reimbursement levels, increasing pressure on revenue and other pressures on health care providers and increasing consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and providers. continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other providers, the emergence of accountable care organizations, vertical integration of providers and other entities, changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians, hospitals and providers and new market entrants, including those not traditionally in the health care industry, may affect the way providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape in which we operate. in some instances, these organizations may compete directly with us, potentially affecting the way we price our products and services or causing us to incur increased costs if we change our operations to be more competitive.
out-of-network providers are not limited by any agreement with us in the amounts they bill. while benefit plans place limits on the amount of charges that will be considered for reimbursement and regulations seek to prescribe payment levels, establish methodologies and dispute resolution processes, out-of-network providers are increasingly sophisticated and aggressive. as a result, the outcome of disputes where we do not have a provider contract may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected.
additionally, certain of our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we compete. our sales could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels.
if we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers, which provide us with, among other things:
•discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies;
•discounts, in the form of rebates, for drug utilization;
•fees for administering rebate programs, including invoicing, allocating and collecting rebates;
•fees for services provided to pharmaceutical manufacturers by our specialty pharmacies; and
•access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticals by our specialty pharmacies.
our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers are typically nonexclusive and terminable on relatively short notice by either party. the consolidation of pharmaceutical manufacturers, the termination or material alteration of our contractual relationships, or our failure to renew such contracts on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. in addition, arrangements between payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums. adoption of new laws, rules or regulations or changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, rules or regulations, relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
if significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace, or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks, including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
more than 67,700 pharmacies participated in one or more of our networks as of december 31, 2020. the ten largest retail pharmacy chains represent approximately 64% of the total number of stores in our largest network. in certain geographic areas of the united states, our networks may be comprised of higher concentrations of one or more large pharmacy chains. contracts with retail pharmacies are generally nonexclusive and are terminable on relatively short notice by either party. if one or more of the larger pharmacy chains terminates its relationship with us, or is able to renegotiate terms substantially less favorable to us, our customers' access to retail pharmacies or our business could be materially adversely affected. the entry of one or more additional large pharmacy chains into the pharmacy benefit management business, the consolidation of existing pharmacy chains or increased leverage or market share by the largest pharmacy providers could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies. changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks, or reduced pharmacy access under our networks, could have a negative impact on our claims volume or our competitiveness in the marketplace, which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations.
changes in drug pricing or industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance.
contracts in the prescription drug industry, including our contracts with retail pharmacy networks and our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy clients, generally use pricing metrics published by third parties as benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs. if these benchmarks are no longer published by third parties, we, or our contractual partners, adopt other pricing benchmarks for establishing prices within the industry, legislation or regulation requires the use of other pricing benchmarks, or future changes in drug prices substantially deviate from our expectations, the short- or long-term impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
as a global company, we face political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that present challenges and could negatively affect our multinational operations or our long-term growth.
as a global company, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. these risks can vary substantially by market, and include political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks, including government intervention that we do not face in our u.s. operations. the global nature of our business and operations may present challenges including, but not limited to, those arising from:
•geopolitical business conditions and demands, including the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union;
•regulation that may discriminate against u.s. companies, favor nationalization or expropriate assets;
•price controls or other pricing issues and exchange controls; restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds out of the countries in which we operate; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations and restrictions on converting currencies from foreign operations into other currencies; uncertainty with respect to the interpretation of tax positions;
•reliance on local employees and interpretations of labor laws in foreign jurisdictions;
•managing our partner relationships in countries outside of the united states;
•providing data protection on a global basis and sufficient levels of technical support in different locations;
•the global trend for companies to enact local data residency requirements;
•acts of civil unrest, war and terrorism, as well as other political and economic conflicts such as through imposition of economic or political sanctions;
•man-made disasters, natural disasters and pandemics, such as the covid-19 pandemic, in locations where we operate; and
•general economic and political conditions.
these factors may increase in significance as we continue to expand globally and operating in new foreign markets may require considerable management time before operations generate any significant revenues and earnings. any one of these challenges could negatively affect our operations or long term growth. for example, due to the concentration of our international business in south korea, the international markets segment is exposed to potential losses resulting from economic and regulatory changes in that country and the geopolitical climate in the korean peninsula, as well as foreign currency movements affecting the south korean currency, that could have a significant impact on the segment's results and our consolidated financial results.
international operations also require us to devote significant resources to implement controls and systems in new markets to comply with, and to ensure that our vendors and partners comply with, u.s. and foreign laws prohibiting bribery, corruption and money laundering, in addition to other regulations regarding, among other things, our products, direct-to-consumer communications, customer privacy, data protection and data residency. violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm. our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges. our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with non-u.s. regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and long-term growth.
strategic transactions involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of integration difficulties, underperformance relative to our expectations and other challenges.
as part of our strategy, we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing arrangements, divestitures and other relationships (collectively referred to as "strategic transactions"). there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities and we may be unable to identify and successfully complete strategic transactions in the future. in addition, from time to time, we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic, growth or profitability objectives, and we may divest or wind down such businesses. we may be unable to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us, within the expected timeframes, or at all. we may have continued financial exposure to divested businesses following the completion of any such transaction, including increased costs due to potential litigation, contingent liabilities and indemnification of the buyer related to, among other things, lawsuits, regulatory matters or tax liabilities.
our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of strategic transactions, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to successfully combine or separate business operations, resources and systems, including data security systems and internal financial control standards, in an efficient and effective manner. integration and separation activities may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected. these activities are complex, costly and time-consuming and may divert management's attention from ongoing business concerns. delays or issues encountered in these activities could have a material adverse effect on the revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition of the company.
strategic transactions could result in increased costs, including facilities and systems consolidation or separation costs and costs to retain key employees, decreases in expected revenues, earnings or cash flows and goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges. as of december 31, 2020, our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of approximately $80 billion, representing 51% of our total consolidated assets. the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if the businesses we acquire do not perform in a manner consistent with our assumptions. future evaluations requiring an impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders' equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. a material decrease in shareholders' equity could negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. in addition, the trading price of our securities may decline if, among other things, we are unable to achieve our estimates of earnings growth and operational cost savings, or the transaction costs related to acquisitions, integrations or divestitures are greater than expected. the trading price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of a transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.
additionally, joint ventures and equity investments present risks that are different from acquisitions, including risks related to: specific operations and finances of the businesses we invest in, selection of appropriate parties, differing objectives of the various parties, competition between and among parties, compliance activities (including compliance with applicable cms requirements), growing the business in a manner acceptable to all the parties, maintaining positive relationships among the parties, clients and customers, initial and ongoing governance of joint ventures and customer and business disruption that may occur upon a joint venture termination.
further, we may finance strategic transactions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price that could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders, or by incurring additional debt that could increase costs and impact our ability to access capital in the future.
in addition, effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to mitigate the risk of fraud. the integration of businesses is likely to cause increasing complexity in our systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. any difficulties in assimilating businesses into our control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. we also rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of joint venture entities and other entities in which we invest and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information that could negatively impact the trading price of our securities and our access to capital.
we are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions.
to improve operating costs, productivity and efficiencies, we contract with third parties for the provision of specific services. our operations may be adversely affected if a third party fails to satisfy its obligations to us, if the arrangement is terminated in whole or in part or if there is a contractual dispute between us and the third party. even though contracts are intended to provide certain protections, we have limited control over the actions of third parties. for example, noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations, any security breach involving one of our third-party vendors or a dispute between us and a third-party vendor related to our arrangement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.
outsourcing also may require us to change our existing operations, adopt new processes for managing these service providers or redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies. if there are delays or difficulties in changing business processes or our third-party vendors do not perform as expected, we may not realize, or not realize on a timely basis, the anticipated economic and other benefits of these relationships. this could result in additional costs or regulatory compliance issues or create other operational or financial problems for us. terminating or transitioning, in whole or in part, arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties, risks of operational delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase. we may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. if there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a security breach, termination or transition in services, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
a significant disruption in service within our operations or among our key suppliers or other third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as claims processing and payment, internet support and customer call centers, data centers and corporate facilities, processing new and renewal business, maintaining appropriate shipment and storage conditions for prescriptions (such as temperature and protection from contamination) and home delivery processing. in some instances, our ability to provide services or products (including processing and dispensing prescriptions) depends on the availability of services and products provided by suppliers, providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, vendors or shipping carriers. a disruption, or threat of disruption, in our supply chain, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, or inability to access or deliver products that meet requisite quality safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our business. additionally, any failure or disruption of our performance of, or our ability to perform, key business functions, including through unavailability or cyberattack of our information technology systems or those of third parties, could cause slower response times, decreased levels of service satisfaction and harm to our reputation. our information technology and other systems interface with and depend on third-party systems and we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could significantly reduce our ability to provide products and services to our customers and clients, which could have material adverse effects on our business and results of operations.
our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems.
our business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care providers and to operate our business. if our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error, or if we, or any of the third-party service providers we engage, were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our clients, customers and health care providers and hinder our ability to provide services and products, establish appropriate pricing for products and services, retain and attract clients and customers, establish reserves and report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance, among other things.
our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success. we must continue to invest in long-term solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations, enhance the customer experience, act as a differentiator in the market and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats. our success is dependent, in large part, on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient and resource-efficient manner. increasing regulatory and legislative changes will place additional demands on our information technology infrastructure that could have a direct impact on resources available for other projects tied to our strategic initiatives. in addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important. we must also develop new systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and customer needs. failure to do so may present compliance challenges and impede our ability to deliver services in a competitive manner. further, because system development projects are long-term in nature, they may be more costly than expected to complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion. our failure to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.
as a large health service company, we are subject to cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents. if we are unable to prevent or contain the effects of any such attacks, we may suffer exposure to substantial liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue or other damages.
our business depends on our clients' and customers' willingness to entrust us with their health-related and other sensitive personal information. computer systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses or malware, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. we have been, and will likely continue to be, the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyberattacks or other computer-related penetrations. there have been, and will likely continue to be, large scale cyberattacks within the health service industry. additionally, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design, manufacturer defects or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information technology. human or technological error has and could in the future result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third-party data or systems; theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service.
as we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally, our exposure to unintended disclosures, data security and related cybersecurity risks increases, including the risk of undetected attacks, damage, loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary or personal information, and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases. if disruptions, disclosures or breaches are not detected quickly, their effect could be compounded. we have implemented security technologies, processes and procedures to protect consumer identity and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware and other cyber risks; however, there are no assurances that such measures will be effective against all types of breaches.
cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to our proprietary systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated. cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties, such as external service providers, and the techniques used change frequently or are often not recognized until after they have been launched. those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. in addition, while we have certain standards for all vendors that provide us services, our vendors, and in turn, their own service providers, may become subject to the same types of security breaches. finally, our offices may be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, misplaced or lost data, human error or similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customers' and clients' data.
the costs to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.
in addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us, our customers or other third parties could expose our customers' private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft. unauthorized dissemination of confidential and proprietary information about our business and strategy could also negatively affect the achievement of our strategic initiatives. such events could cause us to breach our contractual obligations and violate applicable laws. these events would negatively affect our ability to compete, others' trust in us, our reputation, customer base and revenues and expose us to mandatory disclosure requirements, litigation and other enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties or remediation costs and compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages, consent orders and other adverse actions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
in managing medical practices and operating pharmacies, onsite clinics and other types of medical facilities, we may be subject to additional liability that could result in significant time and expense.
in addition to contracting with physicians and other health care providers for services, we employ physicians, pharmacists, nurses and other health care providers at our home delivery and specialty pharmacies, onsite low acuity and primary care practices and infusion clinics that we manage and operate for our customers, as well as certain clinics for our employees. we also provide in-home care through health care providers that we employ, as well as, through third-party contractors. as such, we may be subject to liability for certain acts, omissions, or injuries caused by our employees or agents, or occurring at one of these practices, pharmacies or clinics. the defense of any actions may require the diversion of personnel and other resources and the incurrence of significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.
legal and compliance risks our business is subject to substantial government regulation, as well as new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. the laws and rules governing our business and related interpretations are increasing in number and complexity, are subject to frequent change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other. noncompliance with applicable regulations by us or our third-party vendors could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.
we must identify, assess and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment, as well as comply with the various existing regulations applicable to our business. there are currently pending, and in the future there will likely be, legislative or regulatory proposals which seek to manage the health services industry, including managing prescription drug costs and health records, as well as regulating drug distribution. we expect federal and state governments to continue to enact and seriously consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system. in addition, changes to government policies not specifically targeted to the health services industry, such as a change in tax laws and the corporate tax rate or government spending cuts, could have significant impacts on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. the trading price of our securities may react to the announcement of such proposals. we are unable to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted, or the specific terms thereof, including their effect on our operations; however, certain of these proposals could, if enacted, adversely impact our business and results of operations.
existing or future laws, rules, regulatory interpretations or judgments could force us to change how we conduct our business, affect the products and services we offer and where we offer them, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our costs, including medical, operating, health care technology and administrative costs, and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment. for example, a decision invalidating the aca or portions thereof could result in material changes to the way we conduct our business, as well as the loss of subsidies related to our ifp offerings. we are required to obtain and maintain insurance and other regulatory approvals to, among other things, market many of our products, expand into additional geographic or product markets, increase prices for certain regulated products and consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions. delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. existing or future laws and rules could also require or lead us to take other actions such as changing our business practices, and could increase our liability.
further, failure to effectively implement or adjust our strategic and operational initiatives, such as by reducing operating costs, adjusting premium pricing or benefit design or transforming our business model in response to regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
for more information on regulations affecting our business, see "business - regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
there are various risks associated with participating in government-sponsored programs, such as medicare, including dependence upon government funding, compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight and enforcement.
through our u.s. government business, we contract with cms and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services including medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans. additionally, our evernorth business provides services to government entities and payers participating in government health care programs.
our revenues from government funded programs, including our medicare programs and our government clients, are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state or local governments. funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities. these entities generally have the right to not renew or cancel their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available. unanticipated changes in funding, such as the application of sequestration by the federal or state governments or the failure to provide for continued appropriations or regular ongoing scheduled payments to us, could substantially reduce our revenues and profitability.
the medicare program has been the subject of regulatory reform initiatives. the premium rates paid to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans are established by contract, although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors, some of which are outside our control. for example, the base premium rate paid differs depending upon a combination of various factors such as defined upper payment limits, a member's health status, age, gender, county or region, benefit mix, member eligibility category and risk scores. additionally, a portion of each medicare advantage plan's reimbursement is tied to the plan's star rating, with those plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for quality-based bonus payments. a plan's star rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform well are able to offer enhanced benefits, market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans. the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms, which may make it more difficult to achieve four stars or greater. our medicare advantage plans' and medicare part d plans' operating results, premium revenue and benefit offerings are likely to continue to be significantly determined by their star ratings. there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years. in addition, audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings. accordingly, our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses, which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership or impact our financial performance. see part ii, item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of information - industry developments and other matters affecting our evernorth and u.s. medical segments for additional information on our star ratings.
additionally, if we fail to comply with cms' contractual requirements, including data submission, enrollment and marketing, provider network adequacy, provider directory accuracy, quality measures, claims payment, continuity of care, timely and accurate processing of appeals and grievances, oversight of first tier downstream and related entities and call center performance, we may be subject to administrative actions, including enrollment sanctions or contract termination, fines or other penalties that could impact our profitability. as described under "business - regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k, on november 1, 2018, cms released a proposed rule that would revise its radv methodology and, if adopted in its current form, could result in some combination of degraded plan benefits, higher monthly premiums or reduced choice for the population served by all medicare advantage insurers. while it is uncertain whether cms will finalize the rule as proposed, if adopted, it could have a material impact on the company's future results of operations.
any failure to comply with various state and federal health care laws and regulations, including those directed at preventing fraud and abuse in government funded programs, could result in investigations or litigation, such as actions under the federal false claims act and similar whistleblower statutes under state laws. this could subject us to damage awards, including treble damages, fines, penalties or other enforcement actions, restrictions on our ability to market or enroll new customers, limits on expansion, restrictions or exclusions from programs or other agreements with federal or state governmental agencies, which could adversely impact our business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
we face risks related to litigation, regulatory audits and investigations.
we are routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits, investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of business. these legal matters could include benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, claims arising from consumer protection laws, false claims act laws, claims disputes under federal or state laws and disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements, employment and employment discrimination-related suits, antitrust claims, employee benefit claims, wage and hour claims, tax, privacy, intellectual property and whistleblower claims, shareholder suits and other securities law claims, real estate disputes, claims related to disclosure of certain business practices and claims arising from customer audits and contract performance, including government contracts. in addition, we have incurred and likely will continue to incur liability for practices and claims related to our health care business, such as marketing misconduct, failure to timely or appropriately pay for or provide health care, provider network structure, poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged, provider disputes including disputes over compensation or contractual provisions, erisa claims, allegations related to calculations of cost sharing and claims related to our administration of self-funded business. we are also routinely involved in legal matters arising from our health services business, including without limitation claims related to the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our home delivery and specialty pharmacies, pharmacy benefit management services, such as formulary management services, health benefit management services and provider services. there are currently, and may be in the future, attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the company and other companies in our industry; individual plaintiffs also may bring multiple claims regarding the same subject matter against us and other companies in our industry.
court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. in some cases, substantial noneconomic or punitive damages may be sought. we procure insurance coverage to cover some of these potential liabilities, however we also self-insure a significant portion of our litigation risks. while we maintain some third-party insurance coverage, including excess liability insurance with third-party insurance carriers, certain liabilities or types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may be insufficient to cover the entire damages awarded. resolving disputes is often expensive and disruptive, regardless of the outcome. additionally, it is possible that the resolution of current or future legal matters and claims could result in changes to our industry and business practices, losses material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity or damage to our reputation.
we are frequently the subject of regulatory market conduct and other reviews, audits and investigations by state insurance and health and welfare and pharmacy departments, attorneys general, doj, cms, dol and the oig and comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. additionally, we are, and may in the future be, subject to qui tam actions in which the government may or may not intervene. with respect to our medicare advantage and medicare part d businesses, cms and oig perform audits to determine a health plan's compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations, including compliance with proper coding practices and fraud and abuse enforcement practices through audits designed to detect and correct improper payments. certain of our contracts are currently subject to radv audits by cms and the oig. the doj is conducting an industry-wide investigation of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes, including review of medical charts and health exams, of cigna and a number of other medicare advantage organizations under medicare parts c and d. there also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health services industry, including with respect to claims payment and related escheat practices, and increased scrutiny by other federal and state governmental agencies (such as state attorneys general) empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings.
in addition, various government agencies have conducted investigations and audits into certain pharmacy benefit management practices. many of these investigations and audits have resulted in other companies being subject to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements. we cannot predict what effect, if any, such government investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the industry in general. however, we will likely continue to experience government scrutiny and audit activity, which has and may in the future result in civil penalties.
regulatory audits, investigations or reviews or actions by other government agencies could result in changes to our business practices, retroactive adjustments to certain premiums, significant fines, penalties, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities or other sanctions, including corporate integrity agreements, restrictions on our ability to participate in government programs, market certain products or engage in business-related activities, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, disclosure of an adverse investigation or audit or the imposition of fines or other sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in certain markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services.
a description of material pending legal actions and other legal and regulatory matters is included in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. the outcome of litigation and other legal or regulatory matters is always uncertain.
if we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.
most of our activities involve the receipt, use, storage or transmission of a substantial amount of individuals' protected health information and personally identifiable information. we also use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes, and in some cases, provide access to such de-identified data, or analytics created from such data, to pharmaceutical manufacturers and third-party data aggregators and analysts. we may also use such information to create analytic models designed to predict, and potentially improve, outcomes and patient care. the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with clients. in some cases, such laws, rules, regulations and contractual requirements also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such requirements. we are also subject to various other consumer protection laws that regulate our communications with customers. certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard, which is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. international laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information, such as the gdpr, can be more stringent than in the united states, and they vary across jurisdictions. in addition, more jurisdictions are regulating the transfer of data across borders and domestic privacy and data protection laws are generally becoming more onerous.
these laws, rules and contractual requirements are subject to change and the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding. compliance with existing or new privacy, security and data laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. for more information on privacy regulations to which we are subject, see "business - regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
hipaa requires covered entities to comply with the hipaa privacy, security and breach rules. in addition, business associates must comply with the hipaa security and breach requirements. while we endeavor to provide appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers. hhs administers an audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates. in addition, hhs continues to exercise its enforcement authority, such as enforcement actions resulting from investigations brought on by notification to hhs of a breach. an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance or the implementation of an enforcement action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation.
noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could materially adversely affect our business and reputation, including our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
effective prevention, detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect us.
federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority. fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of customers, billing for unnecessary medical services, improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights. the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us are complex and subject to change. in addition, ongoing vigorous law enforcement, a highly technical regulatory scheme and the dodd-frank act and related regulations enhance regulators' enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections. our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources. failure of our prevention, detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees, could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings, fines and penalties.
in addition, provider or customer fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our self-insured clients. further, during an economic downturn, we may experience increased fraudulent claims volume that may lead to additional costs due to an increase in disputed claims and litigation.
economic risks economic and market conditions affect the value of our financial instruments and the value of particular assets and liabilities, investment income and interest expense.
as an insurer, we have substantial investment assets that support insurance and contractholder deposit liabilities and surplus requirements in our regulated companies. the market values of our investments vary depending on economic and market conditions with no offsetting change in the value of a majority of our liabilities. a substantial portion of our investment assets are in fixed interest-yielding debt securities of varying maturities and commercial mortgage loans. the value of these investment assets can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions. a rise in interest rates would likely reduce the value of our investment portfolio, increase interest expense on our indebtedness and increase investment income as investment assets mature and are replaced. in addition, an economic contraction could result in delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers, reducing our investment income and requiring us to write down the value of our investments.
significant stock market or interest rate declines could result in additional unfunded pension obligations resulting in the need for additional plan funding by us and increased pension expenses.
we currently have unfunded obligations in our frozen pension plans. a significant decline in the value of the plans' equity and fixed income investments or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially increase our expenses and change the timing and amount of required plan funding. this could reduce the cash available to us, including our subsidiaries. we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk associated with our pension obligations. sustained declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the funded status of our pension plans and our reinvestment yield on new investments. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our obligations under the pension plans.
a downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business, and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to access capital.
financial strength, claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are each important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies. ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. we believe that the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our products to certain customers. our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. each of the rating agencies reviews ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. a downgrade of any of these ratings in the future could make it more difficult to either market our products successfully or raise capital to support business growth.
we maintain significant indebtedness in the ordinary course of business and may incur further indebtedness in the future. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt service costs, leaving us with less cash flow from operations available to fund growth, stock repurchases, dividends and other corporate purposes.
the total indebtedness of cigna was approximately $32.9 billion as of december 31, 2020. carrying indebtedness:
•requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to debt payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund our operations and growth strategy, including investments, acquisitions and capital expenditures, make stock repurchases, pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;
•increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, which may require us to dedicate an even greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt and limit our access to capital markets such that additional capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms;
•exposes us to increases in interest rates to the extent increased interest expense is not offset by increased income from our investment assets; and
•limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry.
the covenants in our debt instruments may have the effect, among other things, of restricting our financial and operating flexibility to respond to significant changes in business and economic conditions. we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future which may subject us to additional restrictive covenants and increase the risks described above. if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek additional dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt.
unfavorable developments in economic conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
many factors, including geopolitical issues, future economic downturns, natural disasters and pandemics, availability and cost of credit and other capital and consumer spending can negatively impact the u.s. and global economies. our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on our clients and customers (both employers and individuals), health care providers, pharmacy manufacturers, pharmacy providers and third-party vendors. for example:
•employers may take action to reduce their operating costs by modifying, delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products or making changes in the mix of products purchased that are unfavorable to us.
•higher unemployment rates and workforce reductions could result in lower enrollment in our employer-based plans (including an increase in the number of employees who opt out of employer-based plans) or our individual plans.
•because of unfavorable economic conditions or the aca, employers may stop offering health care coverage to employees or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs.
•if clients are not successful in generating sufficient funds or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us.
•our clients or potential clients may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business.
•our clients may be acquired, consolidated, or otherwise fail to successfully maintain or grow their business or workforce, which could reduce the number of customers we serve or otherwise result in lower than anticipated utilization of our services.
•a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other health care providers, potentially increasing our medical costs.
•our third-party vendors could significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output to reduce their operating costs. our business depends on our ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion.
•other insurers' financial condition may be weakened, increasing the risk that we will receive significant assessments for obligations of insolvent insurers pursuant to guaranty associations, indemnity funds or other similar laws and regulations.
these factors could lead to a decrease in our customer base, revenues or margins or an increase in our operating costs.
in addition, during and following a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, federal and state budgets could be materially adversely affected, resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in federal and state government programs such as medicare and social security or under contracts with government entities. these federal and state budgetary pressures also could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments on us, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we are subject to the credit risk of our reinsurers.
we enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies, primarily in connection with acquisition or divestiture transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired or sold.
under all reinsurance arrangements, reinsurers assume insured losses, subject to certain limitations or exceptions that may include a loss limit. these arrangements also subject us to various obligations, representations and warranties with the reinsurers. reinsurance does not relieve us of liability as the originating insurer. we remain liable to the underlying policyholders if a reinsurer defaults on obligations under the reinsurance arrangement. although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, reinsurers may become financially unsound. if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract or if the liabilities exceed any applicable loss limit, we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies.
the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether the insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract, whether reinsurers or their affiliates have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of the reinsurance contract and the magnitude and type of collateral supporting our reinsurance recoverable, such as holding sufficient qualifying assets in trusts or letters of credit issued. although a portion of our reinsurance exposures are secured, the inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition as of december 31, 2020 compared with december 31, 2019 and our results of operations for 2020 compared with 2019 and 2018 and is intended to help you understand the ongoing trends in our business. we encourage you to read this md&a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k ("form 10-k") and the "risk factors" contained in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k. for comparisons of our results of operations for 2019 compared with 2018, please refer to the previously filed md&a included in part ii, item 7 of our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.
unless otherwise indicated, financial information in this md&a is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for additional information regarding the company's significant accounting policies. in some of our financial tables in this md&a, we present either percentage changes or "n/m" when those changes are so large as to become not meaningful. changes in percentages are expressed in basis points ("bps").
in this md&a, our consolidated measures "adjusted income from operations," earnings per share on that same basis and "adjusted revenues" are not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable gaap measures of "shareholders' net income," "earnings per share" and "total revenues." we also use pre-tax adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues to measure the results of our segments.
we use adjusted income from operations as our principal financial measure of operating performance because management believes it best reflects the underlying results of our business operations and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and profitability. we define adjusted income from operations as shareholders' net income (or income before taxes for the segment metric) excluding realized investment gains and losses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, special items and prior to 2020, results of anthem, inc. and coventry health care inc. ("coventry") (collectively, the "transitioning clients") (see the "key transactions and business developments" section of this md&a for further discussion of transitioning clients). cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the international markets segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. income or expense amounts excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of underlying performance or the responsibility of operating segment management include:
•realized investment gains (losses) including changes in market values of certain financial instruments between balance sheet dates, as well as gains and losses associated with invested asset sales.
•amortization of acquired intangible assets because these relate to costs incurred for acquisitions.
•results of transitioning clients prior to 2020, because those results are not indicative of ongoing results.
•special items, if any, that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to the nature or size of these matters.
the term adjusted revenues is defined as total revenues excluding the following adjustments: revenue contribution from transitioning clients prior to 2020, special items and cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the international markets segment using the equity method of accounting. we exclude these items from this measure because management believes they are not indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business.
executive overview cigna corporation, together with its subsidiaries (either individually or collectively referred to as "cigna," the "company," "we," "our" or "us") is a global health services organization with a mission of helping those we serve improve their health, well-being and peace of mind. we offer a differentiated set of pharmacy, medical, dental and related products and services offered by our subsidiaries. for further information on our business and strategy, see item 1, "business" in this form 10-k.
covid-19 update the novel strain of coronavirus ("covid-19") was declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020. from the onset of the covid-19 pandemic we have taken actions to drive affordability, reduce uncertainty and make health care easier. for customers, these actions include covid-19 related cost share waivers, expanded access to virtual care, support for access to medication and advocating for whole person health through various behavioral health initiatives. we have supported the medical community by simplifying processes and donating medications for a covid-19 clinical trial. cigna and the cigna foundation have assisted our communities through several initiatives including the launch of the brave of heart fund that provides financial assistance to survivors of front-line u.s. health care workers who gave their lives in the fight against covid-19. cigna also provides emotional support services to their families. the evernorth team launched parachuterx, a drug cost assistance program to certain customers without health coverage due to furlough or job loss. cigna medical group was among the first in the united states to administer antibody therapies to high-risk covid-19 patients in a non-hospital setting. cigna also partnered with other organizations on digital access to vaccination records for those who have received the covid-19 vaccine to facilitate return to work and daily activities.
we have continued to support our workforce by enabling remote work where appropriate, and implemented enhanced safety protocols and programs that support the health and mental well-being of our employees. we have continued to execute our business continuity plans over our operations such as leveraging purchasing volume across the pharmaceutical supply chain in order to mitigate risk associated with prescription drug supply. we did not incur significant disruptions to our operations during 2020 from covid-19.
we will continue to work with our clients, customers, providers and employees to provide support during the pandemic.
the covid-19 pandemic has pervasively impacted the economy, financial markets and the global health care delivery systems. the effects of the covid-19 pandemic on the company began to emerge in the united states at the end of the first quarter and were not material to the company's results of operations or financial condition for that period.
beginning in april, we experienced a significant deferral of care by our customers. the deferral of care moderated over the course of the second quarter with utilization levels eventually returning to nearly normal levels by the end of june. in the third quarter, we experienced increased medical utilization as we observed a reduction to the level of deferred care and our customers sought care for covid-19 testing and treatment.
in the fourth quarter, as covid-19 cases increased, the costs for testing and treatment exceeded the savings related to the deferral of care. these impacts were most prevalent in the u.s. medical segment where fourth quarter earnings were adversely impacted by increased costs of covid-19 care and decreased contributions from our specialty products. full year u.s. medical results reflect covid-19 impacts of deferral of care by our customers partially offset by the cost of covid-19 care, the cost of covid-19 related actions including premium relief programs for employer clients, cost share waivers for customers, customer disenrollment and actions to support providers and employees.
our group disability and other results reflect significantly elevated life insurance claims related to the covid-19 pandemic and its effects in the third and fourth quarters. quarterly and year-to-date earnings in our evernorth segment also reflected effects of the pandemic, specifically, a favorable mix of claims as a result of both the type of drugs dispensed as well as the distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling, partially offset by lower 30-day retail script volume. segment results are discussed further in the "segment reporting" section of this md&a and discussion of the impact of covid-19 on our investment portfolio and related considerations regarding our investment outlook can be found in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and in the "investment assets" discussion of this md&a.
while it is difficult to predict the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our results beyond 2020, we believe that such results may be impacted by, among other things, higher medical costs to treat those affected by the virus, lower customer volumes due to rising unemployment, lower future risk adjustment revenue due to disrupted care impeding appropriate documentation of customer risk profiles in our medicare advantage business, the return of costs for those who had previously deferred care, vaccine costs, continued cost share waivers, the potential for continued deferral of care, or lower investment returns.
cigna has taken actions to enhance our liquidity that, combined with our other sources of liquidity described in the "liquidity and capital resources outlook" section below, and our current projections for operating cash flows, we believe are sufficient to support our operations and meet our obligations.
the situation surrounding covid-19 remains fluid, and we are actively managing our response and assessing impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as adverse developments in our business.

commentary: 2020 versus 2019
unless indicated otherwise, the commentary presented below, and in the segment discussions that follow, compare results for the year ended december 31, 2020 with results for the year ended december 31, 2019.
shareholders' net income increase was driven by the gain on sale of the group disability and life business, lower amortization charges and higher adjusted income from operations, partially offset by the absence of earnings from transitioning clients.
adjusted income from operations increased, driven in part by higher earnings in the evernorth segment reflecting customer growth and increased script volumes, an increase in the international markets segment results and lower interest costs in corporate due to a lower level of outstanding debt. these favorable effects were partially offset by lower earnings in the group disability and other segment reflecting significantly elevated life claims related to the effects of covid-19.
medical customers decreased due to declines in the middle market and national accounts market segments and increased disenrollment driven by the impacts of covid-19. those decreases were partially offset by growth in the select, international and medicare advantage segments.
pharmacy revenues increased, reflecting the transition of u.s. medical's customers to evernorth, higher claims volumes, driven by the evernorth collaboration with prime therapeutics and an increase in pricing, primarily due to inflation on branded drugs. these factors were substantially offset by the absence of revenues from the transitioning clients and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the generic fill rate. see the "evernorth segment" section of this md&a for further discussion of pharmacy revenues.
premiums increased, reflecting customer growth in insured products and rate increases reflecting expected medical cost inflation and the return of the health insurance industry tax. these factors were partially offset by the impact of premium relief programs implemented in response to significantly lower than historical utilization as customers deferred care in 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic.
fees and other revenues decreased, primarily reflecting the transition of u.s. medical's commercial customers to evernorth's retail pharmacy network beginning in the third quarter of 2019 (see note 3(k) to the consolidated financial statements for further information).
net investment income decrease was driven by lower yields, including lower income from partnership investments due to current economic conditions. these effects were partially offset by higher average assets. see the "investment assets" section of this md&a for further discussion.
pharmacy and other service costs increased, reflecting the transition of u.s. medical's customers to evernorth, higher claims volumes, driven by the evernorth collaboration with prime therapeutics and an increase in pricing, primarily due to inflation on branded drugs. these factors were substantially offset by the impact of the absence of the transitioning clients and, to a lesser extent, effective management of supply chain and the favorable impact of the mix of claims.
medical costs and other benefit expenses increased, reflecting both customer growth and direct costs associated with covid-19, partially offset by care deferrals in insured products in u.s. medical and higher life claims in group disability and other due to the effects of the covid-19 pandemic.
selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat, primarily reflecting lower charges in 2020 for the organizational efficiency plan and the risk corridors claim recovery recognized in the third quarter of 2020 (see the "risk mitigation programs - individual aca business" section of this md&a and note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion), offset by the return of the health insurance industry tax.
amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased, primarily reflecting lower amortization of customer-related intangibles associated with the transitioning clients.
income tax expense increased for 2020, largely attributable to the sale of cigna's group disability and life business. the consolidated effective tax rate decreased slightly, driven by recognition of certain incremental federal and state tax benefits, largely offset by the return of the nondeductible health insurance industry tax.
key transactions and business developments sale of group disability and life business as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, cigna sold the u.s. group disability and life business to new york life insurance company for $6.2 billion on december 31, 2020. the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a provides discussion of the use of proceeds from this divestiture.
organizational efficiency plan consistent with our commitment to affordability for our customers and clients, during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company committed to a plan to increase our organizational alignment and operational efficiency and reduce costs. as a result, we recognized a charge in selling, general and administrative expenses of $207 million, pre-tax ($162 million, after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and an additional charge of $31 million pre-tax ($24 million, after-tax) in the first quarter of 2020. we expect to realize annualized after-tax savings of approximately $200 million. a substantial portion of the savings was realized in 2020.
merger with express scripts as discussed in more detail in our 2019 form 10-k, cigna acquired express scripts on december 20, 2018 in a cash and stock transaction valued at $52.8 billion. costs related to this transaction are reported in "integration and transaction-related costs" as a special item and excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of future underlying performance of the business. the integration of this acquisition has been completed.
on january 30, 2019, anthem, a former client, exercised its early termination right and terminated its pharmacy benefit management services agreement with us, effective march 1, 2019. there was a twelve-month transition period that ended march 1, 2020. we excluded the results of express scripts' contract with anthem (and also coventry) from our non-gaap reporting metrics adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations for 2019 and refer to these clients as transitioning clients. as of december 31, 2019, the transition was substantially complete; therefore, beginning in 2020, we no longer exclude results of transitioning clients from our reported adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations.
industry developments and other matters the "business - regulation" section of this form 10-k provides a detailed description of the patient protection and affordable care act ("aca") provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our businesses, including regulations issued by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ("cms") and the departments of the treasury and health and human services. our businesses continue to operate in a dynamic environment, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including the aca, continue to be subject to legislative, regulatory and judicial challenges. the following table provides information on the expected impact of these items and other matters:
item                             description medicare advantage ("ma")        medicare star quality ratings ("star ratings"): cms uses a star rating system to measure how well ma plans perform and scores performance in several categories, including quality of care and customer service. star ratings range from one to five stars. cms recognizes plans with star ratings of four stars or greater with quality bonus payments and the ability to offer enhanced benefits. approximately 77% of our ma customers were in four star or greater plans for bonus payments received in 2020 and 87% for bonus payments to be received in 2021. in october 2020, cms announced the star ratings for bonus payments to be received in 2022. we expect the percentage of our ma customers in four star or greater plans will increase to 88% for bonus payments to be received in 2022.
ma rates: final ma reimbursement rates for 2021 were published by cms in april 2020, and final rates for 2022 were published by cms in january 2021. we do not expect the new rates to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in 2021 or 2022.
risk adjustment: as discussed in the "regulation" and "risk factors" sections of this form 10-k, our ma business is subject to reviews, including risk adjustment data validation ("radv") audits by cms and the office of the inspector general ("oig"). we expect that cms, oig and other federal agencies will continue to closely scrutinize components of the medicare program.
the "regulation" section of this form 10-k also discusses a proposed rule issued by cms in 2018 for radv audits of contract year 2011 and all subsequent years that included, among other things, extrapolation of the error rate related to radv audit findings without applying the adjustment for underlying fee-for-service data errors as currently contemplated by cms' radv audit methodology. radv audits for our contract years 2011 through 2015 are currently in process. cms has announced its intent to use third-party auditors to audit all medicare advantage contracts by either a comprehensive or a targeted radv review for each contract year. if the proposed rule is adopted in its current form, it could result in some combination of degraded plan benefits, higher monthly premiums and reduced choice for the population served by all ma insurers. the company, along with other ma organizations and additional interested parties, submitted comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. the comment period concluded on august 28, 2019 and cms is expected to act by november 2021. if cms adopts the rule as proposed, there could be a material impact on the company's future results of operations, though we expect the rule would be subject to legal challenges. in addition, the company is subject to oig radv audits that are in process.
also, as described in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the u.s. department of justice is currently conducting an industry-wide investigation of risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes, which in the case of certain other ma organizations has resulted in litigation.

aca litigation: as described in the "business - regulation" section of this form 10-k, a federal district court ruled that the "individual mandate" in the aca is unconstitutional and that the entire law must be struck down. on appeal, the court of appeals for the fifth circuit agreed that the "individual mandate" is unconstitutional but ordered the district court to reexamine whether the other provisions of the aca can remain in effect, thereby leaving in doubt whether the entire aca is unconstitutional until there is a final judicial determination on appeal. the california-led states and the u.s. house of representatives filed petitions seeking to appeal the fifth circuit's ruling to the u.s. supreme court. on march 2, 2020, the supreme court agreed to hear the appeals. the case was argued before the supreme court on november 10, 2020, and a decision is expected by the end of june 2021.
risk mitigation programs - individual aca business risk corridors. in 2016, we recorded an allowance for the balance of our aca risk corridors receivable based on court decisions and the large program deficit. on april 27, 2020, the u.s. supreme court ruled that insurers are entitled to the full amount due under the risk corridors program. the supreme court remanded the cases before it to the lower courts for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. we filed a lawsuit in may 2020 seeking payment of these funds. we received $120 million in payments in september 2020, which resolved our risk corridors claim.
risk adjustment. at the end of each program year the risk adjustment balances are subject to audit by cms through the radv program. radv audits for the 2017 and 2018 benefit years have been completed, subject to the error rates appeal period. final settlement for the 2017 and 2018 benefit years is expected in 2021 and 2022, respectively. based on the information currently available, we have adjusted our risk adjustment balances to reflect our estimate of expected outcome as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019.

liquidity we maintain liquidity at two levels: the subsidiary level and the parent company level.
liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of:
•pharmacy, medical costs and other benefit payments;
•expense requirements, primarily for employee compensation and benefits, information technology and facilities costs;
•income taxes; and
•debt service.
our subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by:
•maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments;
•using cash flows from operating activities;
•matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities;
•selling investments; and
•borrowing from affiliates, subject to applicable regulatory limits.
60
liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of:
•debt service;
•payment of declared dividends to shareholders;
•lending to subsidiaries as needed; and
•pension plan funding.
the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by:
•maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments;
•collecting dividends from its subsidiaries;
•using proceeds from issuing debt and common stock; and
•borrowing from its subsidiaries, subject to applicable regulatory limits.
dividends from our insurance, health maintenance organization ("hmo") and foreign subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these restrictions. most of evernorth's subsidiaries are not subject to regulatory restrictions regarding dividends and therefore provide significant financial flexibility to cigna.

the following discussion explains variances in the various categories of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities consist principally of cash receipts and disbursements for pharmacy revenues and costs, premiums, fees, investment income, taxes, benefit costs and other expenses.
cash flows from operating activities increased, primarily driven by higher pharmacy and services costs payables due to business growth, offset by increases in accounts receivable due to business growth, higher inventory purchases and the resumption of the health insurance industry tax.
investing and financing activities cash flows from investing activities increased, primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of the group disability and life business, partially offset by higher net investment purchases.
cash used in finance activities increased, primarily due to stock repurchases and debt repayments, partially offset by higher debt issuance.
we maintain a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors. under this program, we may repurchase shares from time to time, depending on market conditions and alternate uses of capital. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, general business and market conditions and alternate uses of capital. the share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases in compliance with rule 10b-18 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, including through rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions. the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, we repurchased 21.9 million shares for approximately $4.1 billion. from january 1, 2021 through february 24, 2021, we repurchased 8.1 million shares for approximately $1.7 billion. share repurchase authority was $2.1 billion as of february 24, 2021.
capital resources our capital resources consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and investments maintained at regulated subsidiaries required to underwrite insurance risks, cash flows from operating activities, our commercial paper program, credit agreements and the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities. our businesses generate significant cash flow from operations, some of which is subject to regulatory restrictions relative to the amount and timing of dividend payments to parent. dividends from u.s. regulated subsidiaries were $2.3 billion in 2020 and 2019. nonregulated subsidiaries also generate significant cash flow from operating activities, which is typically available immediately to parent for general corporate purposes.
we prioritize our use of capital resources to:
•invest in capital expenditures, primarily related to technology to support innovative solutions for our customers, provide the capital necessary to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to repay debt and fund pension obligations if necessary;
•pay dividends to shareholders;
•consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous; and
•return capital to shareholders through share repurchases.
at december 31, 2020, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 39.5%, a decline from 45.2% at december 31, 2019.
in connection with the sale of the group disability and life business that closed on december 31, 2020, we deployed approximately $3.0 billion to debt repayment by: (i) repaying in full our $1.4 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement entered into on april 1, 2020, on december 31, 2020; (ii) redeeming in full the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of cigna's senior floating rate notes due 2021 on january 15, 2021 at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the indenture governing the notes; and (iii) repaying certain of our outstanding commercial paper balances in january 2021.
in 2018, cigna entered into a $3.25 billion five-year revolving credit agreement and a $3.0 billion term loan credit agreement in financing the express scripts acquisition. the term loan credit agreement was repaid in full and terminated in the fourth quarter of 2019.
in 2019, cigna entered into an additional $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement that expired in october 2020, at which point we replaced the revolving credit agreement with a new $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement which will expire in october 2021.
our revolving credit agreements provide us the ability to borrow amounts for general corporate purposes, including for purpose of providing liquidity support if necessary under our commercial paper program discussed below. as of december 31, 2020, there were no outstanding balances under either of the revolving credit agreements.
cigna also maintains a commercial paper program and may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes privately placed on a discount basis through certain broker dealers at any time not to exceed $4.25 billion. the net proceeds of issuances have been and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. the commercial paper program had approximately $1.0 billion outstanding at december 31, 2020 at an average interest rate of 0.2%.
see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our credit agreements and commercial paper program.
our capital management strategy to support the liquidity and regulatory capital requirements of our foreign operations and certain international growth initiatives is to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings generated by our foreign operations. this strategy does not materially limit our ability to meet our liquidity and capital needs in the united states.
liquidity and capital resources outlook we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs through our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash flows from operations, commercial paper program, credit agreements and the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities. as of december 31, 2020, we had $4.25 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our revolving credit agreements (which amounts are available for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity support for our commercial paper program), $3.2 billion of remaining capacity under our commercial paper program and $10.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately $5.2 billion of which was held by the parent company or certain nonregulated subsidiaries. we actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy. a description of our outstanding debt can be found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
on january 6, 2021, cigna initiated a quarterly cash dividend and declared the first quarterly cash dividend of $1.00 per share of cigna common stock to be paid on march 25, 2021 to shareholders of record as of march 10, 2021. cigna currently intends to pay regular quarterly dividends, with future declarations subject to approval by its board of directors and the board's determination that the declaration of dividends remains in the best interests of cigna and its shareholders. the decision of whether to pay future dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be based on the company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, the requirements of applicable law and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant.
as of december 31, 2020, our unfunded pension liability was $977 million, an increase of $104 million from december 31, 2019, primarily attributable to a decrease in discount rates of approximately 80 basis points, partially offset by investment asset returns. in 2020, we made an immaterial pension contribution as required under the pension protection act of 2006. we expect the required contributions for 2021 to be immaterial. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
risks to our liquidity and capital resources outlook include cash projections that may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if our ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the "risk factors" section of this form 10-k. though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity, significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs. in addition to the sources of liquidity discussed above, the parent company can borrow an additional $1.7 billion from its subsidiaries without further approvals as of december 31, 2020.
guarantees and contractual obligations we are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. see the: "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a for additional information on how we manage our liquidity requirements related to these obligations. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of various guarantees.

on balance sheet:
•insurance liabilities. excluded from the table above are $4 billion of insurance liabilities ($3 billion in contractholder deposit funds; $1 billion in future policy benefits) associated with the sold retirement benefits, individual life insurance and annuity businesses, reinsured workers' compensation, as well as the group life and personal accident businesses as their related net cash flows are not expected to impact our cash flows. excluding these amounts, the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of $17 billion recorded on the balance sheet. this is because some of the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting, charges and fees. the timing and amount of actual future cash flows may differ from those presented above.
◦contractholder deposit funds: see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy for this liability. expected future cash flows presented above also include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees for universal life policies.
◦future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses: see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies for these liabilities. expected future cash flows for these liabilities presented in the table above are undiscounted. the expected future cash flows for guaranteed minimum death benefit ("gmdb") reported in future policy benefits do not consider any of the related reinsurance arrangements.
•long-term debt includes scheduled interest payments and current maturities of long-term debt. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding long-term debt. finance leases are included in long-term debt and primarily represent obligations for information technology network storage, servers and equipment. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding finance leases.
•other noncurrent liabilities include estimated payments for guaranteed minimum income benefit ("gmib") contracts (without considering any related reinsurance arrangements), pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations, supplemental and deferred compensation plans, interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and reinsurance liabilities. estimated payments of $61 million for deferred compensation, non-qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year and are included in the table above. we expect to make immaterial contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during 2021 and they are reflected in the above table. we expect to make payments subsequent to 2021 for these obligations; however, subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension obligations.
•operating leases see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the table above excludes the liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such future payments. in the event we are unable to sustain all of our $1.2 billion of uncertain tax positions it could result in future tax payments of approximately $900 million. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on uncertain tax positions.

(1)see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
our estimated future service commitments primarily represent contracts for certain outsourced business processes and information technology maintenance and support. we generally have the ability to terminate these agreements, but do not anticipate doing so at this time. purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancellable without penalty and those that do not contractually require minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.
guarantees we are contingently liable for various financial and other guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
•it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and
•changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
management has discussed how critical accounting estimates are developed and selected with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below. we regularly evaluate items that may impact critical accounting estimates.
as discussed in the executive overview of this md&a, the covid-19 pandemic has pervasively impacted the economy, financial markets and the global health care delivery systems. if the impact of the covid-19 pandemic beyond 2020 is worse than management's current projections, these adverse effects to our business could impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units.
in addition to the estimates presented in the following tables, there are other accounting estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements, including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits, as well as estimates with respect to pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions and certain compensation accruals.
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience significantly differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition. the tables below present the adverse impacts of certain possible changes in assumptions. the effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, except for assessing impairment of goodwill.

the company conducts its quantitative evaluation for goodwill impairment at least annually during the third quarter at the reporting unit level and performs qualitative impairment assessments on a quarterly basis to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
goodwill and other intangibles as of december 31 were as follows (in millions): ·2020 - goodwill $44,648; other intangible assets $35,179·2019 - goodwill $44,602; other intangible assets $36,562 see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our goodwill and other intangible assets.

segment reporting the following section of this md&a discusses the results of each of our segments. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our segments.
in segment discussions, we present adjusted revenues and "pre-tax adjusted income from operations," defined as income before taxes excluding realized investment gains (losses), amortization of acquired intangible assets, special items and, for periods prior to 2020, results of transitioning clients. ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as pre-tax adjusted income from operations. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these metrics and a reconciliation of income before income taxes to pre-tax adjusted income from operations, as well as a reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues. note 22 to the consolidated financial statements also explains that segment revenues include both external revenues and sales between segments that are eliminated in corporate.
in these segment discussions, we also present "pre-tax adjusted margin," defined as pre-tax adjusted income from operations divided by adjusted revenues.
as of the third quarter 2020, the segment previously reported as health services is reported as evernorth, and the segment previously reported as integrated medical is reported as u.s. medical. there are no changes to the underlying business reported in either segment.
see the "executive overview" section of this md&a for summarized financial results of each of our segments.
evernorth segment evernorth includes a broad range of coordinated and point solution health services, including pharmacy solutions, benefits management solutions, care solutions and intelligence solutions. as described in the introduction to segment reporting, evernorth performance is measured using the below metrics:
•adjusted gross profit and pre-tax adjusted income from operations, which exclude the impact of special items.
•adjusted pharmacy script volume is calculated by multiplying the total non-specialty network scripts filled through 90-day programs and home delivery scripts by three and counting all other network and specialty scripts as one script.
•generic fill rate is defined as the total number of generic scripts divided by the total overall scripts filled. generally, higher generic fill rates reduce revenues, as generic drugs are typically priced lower than the branded drugs they replace. however, as ingredient cost paid to pharmacies on generic drugs is incrementally lower than the price charged to our clients, higher generic fill rates generally have a favorable impact on our gross profit. the home delivery generic fill rate is currently lower than the network generic fill rate as fewer generic substitutions are available among maintenance medications (such as therapies for chronic conditions) commonly dispensed from home delivery pharmacies as compared to acute medications that are primarily dispensed by pharmacies in our retail networks.
the key factors that impact evernorth revenues and costs of revenues are volume, mix of claims and price. these key factors are discussed further below. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for additional information on revenue and cost recognition policies for this segment.
•as our clients' claim volumes increase or decrease, our resulting revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly increase or decrease. our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of changes in purchasing discounts.
•the mix of claims generally considers the type of drug and distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling. types of drugs can have an impact on our pharmacy revenues, pharmacy and other service costs and gross profit, including amounts payable under certain financial and performance guarantees with our clients. in addition to the types of drugs, the mix of generic claims (i.e., generic fill rate) also impacts our gross profit. furthermore, our gross profit differs among network, home delivery and specialty distribution methods and can impact our profitability.
•our client contract pricing is impacted by our ongoing ability to negotiate supply chain contracts for pharmacy network, pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing and manufacturer rebates. as we seek to improve the effectiveness of our integrated solutions for the benefit of our clients, we are continuously innovating and optimizing the supply chain. our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of supply chain initiatives implemented. inflation also impacts our pricing because most of our contracts provide that we bill clients and pay pharmacies based on a generally recognized price index for pharmaceuticals. therefore, the rate of inflation for prescription drugs and our efforts to manage this inflation for our clients can affect our revenues and cost of revenues.
in this md&a, we present revenues and gross profit, as well as adjusted revenues and adjusted gross profit, consistent with our segment reporting metrics, which exclude special items and, for periods prior to 2020, contributions from transitioning clients. as of december 31, 2019, the transition of these clients was substantially complete; therefore, beginning in 2020, we no longer exclude results of transitioning clients from our adjusted metrics. see the "key transactions and business developments" section of this form 10-k md&a for further discussion of transitioning clients and why we present this information.

2020 versus 2019
in the first quarter of 2020, u.s. government operating segment customers transitioned to express scripts' retail pharmacy network. in the third quarter of 2019, u.s. commercial operating segment customers transitioned to express scripts' retail pharmacy network. results of operations for 2018 reflected the results for the period following the acquisition of express scripts on december 20, 2018 along with the legacy cigna home delivery business.
adjusted network revenues. the increase reflected the transition of u.s. medical's customers, higher claims volume, due to our collaboration with prime therapeutics, and increased prices due to inflation on branded drugs. these favorable effects were partially offset by claims mix due to the increase in the generic fill rate.
adjusted home delivery and specialty revenues. the increase reflected higher prices, due to inflation on branded drugs and higher home delivery and specialty claims volume. these increases were partially offset by claims mix due to an increase in the generic fill rate.
adjusted gross profit. the increase reflected customer growth, higher adjusted pharmacy script volumes, benefits from the effective management of supply chain and the favorable impact of claims mix as a result of the types of drugs dispensed, the distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling and an increase in the generic fill rate.
pre-tax adjusted income from operations. the increase reflected customer growth, higher adjusted pharmacy scripts volumes, benefits from the effective management of supply chain, and the favorable impact of claims mix as a result of the types of drugs dispensed, the distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling and an increase in the generic fill rate, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses due to client transitions.
u.s. medical segment u.s. medical includes cigna's u.s. commercial and u.s. government businesses that provide comprehensive medical and coordinated solutions to clients and customers. u.s. commercial products and services include medical, pharmacy, behavioral health, dental, vision, health advocacy programs and other products and services for insured and self-insured customers. u.s. government solutions include medicare advantage, medicare supplement, and medicare part d plans for seniors, medicaid plans, and individual health insurance plans both on and off the public exchanges. as described in the introduction to segment reporting, performance of the u.s. medical segment is measured using pre-tax adjusted income from operations. key factors affecting profitability for this segment include:
•customer growth;
•revenues from integrated specialty products, including pharmacy services sold to clients and customers across all funding solutions;
•percentage of medicare advantage customers in plans eligible for quality bonus payments;
•benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums (medical care ratio or "mcr") for our insured commercial and government businesses; and
•selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of adjusted revenues (expense ratio).

2020 versus 2019
adjusted revenues. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared with 2019 reflects customer growth in our medicare advantage and u.s. commercial insured businesses, as well as higher premium rates due to anticipated underlying medical cost trend and the resumption of the health insurance industry tax. these favorable effects were partially offset by the impact of premium relief programs for clients beginning in the second quarter of 2020 in response to significantly lower than historical utilization as individuals deferred care due to the covid-19 pandemic.
pre-tax adjusted income from operations was essentially flat reflecting customer growth in our u.s. commercial insured and medicare advantage businesses and net favorable covid-19 related impacts; offset by the return of the health insurance industry tax and less favorable prior period development. covid-19 related impacts include deferral of care by our customers; partially offset by direct covid-19 costs, costs of actions we have taken to support customers, providers and employees, and increased disenrollment resulting from the economic impacts of the pandemic.
medical care ratio. the decrease reflects covid-19 related impacts and the pricing effect of the health insurance industry tax. covid-19 related impacts include deferral of care by our customers; partially offset by direct covid-19 costs and premium relief programs extended to employer clients.
expense ratio. the expense ratio was flat reflecting higher insured revenues as well as efficiencies from continued disciplined expense management and the resumption of the health insurance industry tax.
other items affecting u.s. medical results unpaid claims and claim expenses our unpaid claims and claim expenses liability was higher as of december 31, 2020 compared with december 31, 2019, primarily due to customer growth in our medicare advantage and u.s. commercial insured businesses.
medical customers our medical customer base decreased at december 31, 2020 compared with december 31, 2019, reflecting a lower customer base in our middle markets and national accounts segments and increased disenrollment resulting from the economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic; partially offset by growth in our select segment and our medicare advantage business.
a medical customer is defined as a person meeting any one of the following criteria:
•is covered under a medical insurance policy, managed care arrangement or service agreement issued by us;
•has access to our provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or

2020 versus 2019
adjusted revenues increased mainly due to business growth in asia and europe, partially offset by premium relief programs, primarily in europe and unfavorable foreign currency movements.
pre-tax adjusted income from operations increased reflecting lower acquisition and loss ratios and business growth, primarily in asia, partially offset by higher expense ratios. the ratios in 2020 reflect the costs of actions to support clients; additionally, the expense ratio reflects actions to support employees and investments in the business for future growth.
the segment's loss ratio decreased reflecting lower medical utilization due to the covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by premium relief programs.
the acquisition cost ratio decreased reflecting an update to our commission deferral process and lower acquisition expenses in asia, partially offset by premium relief programs.
the expense ratio (excluding acquisition costs) increased, reflecting strategic investments and the unfavorable impact of premium relief programs.
other items related to international markets results south korea is the single largest geographic market for our international markets segment. for the year ended december 31, 2020, south korea generated 38% of the segment's adjusted revenues and 60% of the segment's pre-tax adjusted income from operations.

•premium growth, including new business and customer retention;
•net investment income;
•benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums (loss ratio); and
•selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues excluding net investment income (expense ratio).

adjusted revenues increased due to growth in disability, life and voluntary products, partially offset by lower investment income.
pre-tax adjusted income from operations and margin decreased due to unfavorable life claims experience related to the covid-19 pandemic, unfavorable disability claims experience and lower investment income, partially offset by favorable results in our voluntary products.
sale of u.s. group disability and life business. as discussed further in the executive overview section of this md&a, we sold our u.s. group disability and life business on december 31, 2020. because this business constituted the vast majority of the segment, going forward, we would expect a substantial decline in adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations in this segment.

as a result of the u.s. group disability and life business divestiture, $7.8 billion of debt securities were transferred to new york life on december 31, 2020, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. the debt securities transferred to new york life were primarily corporate and state and local government sectors. this decrease in our debt securities portfolio was partially offset by an increase in valuations due to decreasing yields and net purchase activity during the year.
as of december 31, 2020, $15.6 billion, or 86% of the debt securities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (baa and above, or equivalent) and the remaining $2.5 billion were below investment grade. the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. although our allocation to below investment grade bonds has increased since the prior year, these quality characteristics have not otherwise changed materially from the prior year and remain consistent with our investment strategy.
investments in debt securities are diversified by issuer, geography and industry as appropriate. on an aggregate basis, the debt securities portfolio continues to perform according to original investment expectations. however, due to the economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, there are certain issuers, particularly within the aviation, energy and hospitality sectors, that are showing signs of distress, primarily in the form of requests for temporary covenant relief. there were no material unrealized losses in any of these sectors as of the reporting date. we continue to monitor the economic environment and its effect on our portfolio, and consider the impact of various factors in determining the allowance for credit losses on debt securities, which is discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
foreign government obligations are concentrated in asia, primarily south korea, consistent with our risk management practice and local regulatory requirements of our international business operations. corporate debt securities include private placement assets of $6.0 billion. these investments are generally less marketable than publicly-traded bonds; however, yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly-traded bonds with comparable credit risk. we perform a credit analysis of each issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions, if warranted.
commercial mortgage loans as of december 31, 2020, the $1.4 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 45 loans that are in good standing. our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower. given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash invested generally ranging between 30 and 40%, we remain confident that the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms. for further discussion of the results and changes in key loan metrics, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
as a result of the u.s. group disability and life business divestiture, $0.6 billion of commercial mortgage loans were transferred to new york life on december 31, 2020, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. loans are secured by high quality commercial properties, located in strong institutional markets, and are generally made at less than 65% of the property's value at origination of the loan. property value, debt service coverage, quality, building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations. we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans.
covid-19 has negatively impacted commercial real estate fundamentals and capital market activity with concentrated weakness in hotels and regional malls. our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified by property type and geography with no material exposure to hotels and no exposure to regional shopping malls. we continue to monitor the long-term impacts on the office sector due to growing headwinds: expanded remote working flexibility, shorter term leases and corporate migration to lower cost states. our mortgage loans secured by office properties are in good standing.
other long-term investments other long-term investments of $2.8 billion as of december 31, 2020 included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships, direct investments in real estate joint ventures and other deposit activity that is required to support various insurance and health services businesses. the increase in other long-term investments is driven by net new funding activity. these limited partnership entities typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately-held companies and equity real estate. given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities, we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns. to mitigate risk, these investments are diversified across approximately 175 separate partnerships and approximately 90 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships. also, the underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type and geographic region. no single partnership investment exceeded 4% of our securities and real estate partnership portfolio.
income from our limited partnership investments is generally reported on a one quarter lag due to the timing of when financial information is received from the general partner or manager of the investments. we could experience losses into future periods, but the magnitude of these losses will depend in part on the length and extent of the economic disruption, the speed of the recovery and the overall economic impacts.
we participate in an insurance joint venture in china with a 50% ownership interest. we account for this joint venture on the equity method of accounting and report our share of the net assets of $0.8 billion in other assets. our 50% share of the investment portfolio supporting the joint venture's business is approximately $5.6 billion, primarily invested in chinese corporate and government debt securities diversified by issuer, industry and geography, as appropriate. to a lesser extent and consistent with its investment strategy, the joint venture is invested in chinese equity investments comprised of approximately 50% equity mutual funds, with the remainder invested in equity securities and private equity partnerships. we participate in the approval of the joint venture's investment strategy and continuously review its execution. there were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of december 31, 2020.
investment outlook the impact of covid-19 on the economy, despite unprecedented monetary and fiscal support, and the uncertainty as to the strength and sustainability of the recovery prior to a widely available vaccine, continues to dominate financial markets. the low interest rate environment continues to pressure income from both short-term and longer-term investments. u.s. treasury rates remain near all-time lows and the wider market credit spreads experienced during the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 have meaningfully narrowed, resulting in historically low yields for investment grade assets. we continue to actively monitor the economic impact of the pandemic, as well as fiscal and monetary responses, and their potential impact on the portfolio. net investment income projections into 2021 reflect continued market volatility and portfolio impacts, particularly in certain sectors such as aviation, hospitality and energy, as well as other areas most severely impacted by covid-19. future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date. these future conditions are not reasonably predictable; however, we believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms. based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities, we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long-term. although future impairment losses resulting from interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investment-specific and the global economic uncertainties discussed above remain possible, we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.
market risk financial instruments our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices. consistent with disclosure requirements, the following items have been excluded from this consideration of market risk for financial instruments:
•changes in the fair values of insurance-related assets and liabilities because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk;
•changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans (and related assets); and
•changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, deferred policy acquisition costs, taxes and various accrued liabilities. because they are not financial instruments, their primary risks are other than market risk.
excluding these items, our primary market risk exposures from financial instruments are:
•interest-rate risk on fixed-rate, medium-term instruments. changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return.
•foreign currency exchange rate risk of the u.s. dollar, net of derivatives used for hedging, is primarily to the south korean won, chinese yuan renminbi and new zealand dollar. an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
our management of market risks we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk:
•investment/liability matching. we generally select investment assets with characteristics (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity) that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations. shorter-term investments generally support shorter-term life and health liabilities. medium-term, fixed-rate investments support interest-sensitive and health liabilities. longer-term investments generally support products with longer payout periods such as annuities.
•use of local currencies for foreign operations. we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies. this technique limits exchange rate risk to our net assets.
•use of derivatives. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our primary market risks. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.
effect of market fluctuations assuming a 100 basis point increase in interest rates and 10% strengthening in the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies, the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments, subject to the exclusions noted above (particularly insurance liabilities), would have been as follows as of december 31:
market scenario for certain non-insurance financial instruments                                                loss in fair value
(in billions)                                                                 2020                    2019
100 basis point increase in interest rates (excluding long-term debt)                     $1.4                          $1.6
10% strengthening in u.s. dollar to foreign currencies                                    $0.4                          $0.3
the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates, primarily on debt securities and commercial mortgage loans, was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models, primarily duration modeling. the decrease in our sensitivity to market interest rates since the prior year is primarily due to our decreased interest sensitive investment portfolio base, due to the transfer of debt securities and commercial mortgage loans to new york life on december 31, 2020. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the divestiture of our u.s. group disability and life business.
in the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the fair value of the company's long-term debt would decrease approximately $3.0 billion at december 31, 2020 and $2.5 billion at december 31, 2019. changes in the fair value of our long-term debt do not impact our financial position or operating results. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company's debt.
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of certain financial instruments held by us was estimated to be 10% of the fair value of these instruments, translated to the u.s. dollar. our foreign operations hold investment assets, such as debt securities, cash and cash equivalents that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities.

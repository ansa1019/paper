item 1a.risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and operations.
our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers. in addition to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models, we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet. international, national, regional and local economic conditions, such as recessionary economic cycles, protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products. demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services, which fluctuates based on numerous factors, including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers, as well as general economic conditions. moreover, the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it services, such as cloud computing and highly orchestrated software defined networking environments. as a result, spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted. in addition, customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis and to reduce their total cost of ownership. these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
cloud-based computing trends present competitive and execution risks customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloud-based software and services accessed via various smart client devices. pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloud-based services for customers. in addition, new cloud infrastructures are enabling the emergence of new competitors including large cloud providers who offer their own adc functionality as well as smaller companies targeting the growing numbers of "born in the cloud" applications. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloud-based software and services strategies. while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloud-based services provides us with a strong foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful. in addition to software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud-computing services. these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas, including:
•continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloud-based services that generate increasing traffic and market share;
•maintaining the utility, compatibility and performance of our software on the growing array of cloud computing platforms and the enhanced interoperability requirements associated with orchestration of cloud computing environments; and
•implementing the infrastructure to deliver our own cloud-based services.
these new business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
industry consolidation may result in increased competition some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered. we have also entered into large, strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace. as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery, mobility, cloud networking and cloud platform markets, these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterprise-level hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships. these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial, technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services. the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can. these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application services market the markets we serve are new, rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future. our principal competitors in the application services market include citrix systems, inc., radware ltd., and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set, such as: a10 networks, amazon web services, haproxy, microsoft azure, and vmware.
in related markets, we compete with companies such as the following:
•cisco, juniper networks, and a10 networks for carrier-grade firewall capabilities;
•akamai, imperva, and citrix systems in the web application firewall market;
•cisco, juniper networks, and a10 networks in carrier grade nat;
•symantec/blue coat and a10 networks in ssl orchestration;
•pulse security and ping identity for access policy manager;
we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets. as we continue to expand globally, we may see new competitors in different geographic regions. in addition, larger companies with significant resources, brand recognition, and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application services solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors. potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance.
our success depends on our timely development of new products and features, market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products the markets for our products and services are characterized by:
•rapid technological change;
•evolving industry standards;
•consolidation of network and application functions into existing network infrastructure products;
•requirements that our products interoperate with those of other it vendors to enable ease of management;
•fluctuations in customer demand;
•changes in customer requirements; and
•frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements.
our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes, and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers. in addition, our products must interoperate with our end customers' it infrastructure, which often have different specifications, deploy products from multiple vendors, and utilize multiple protocol standards. our customers' it infrastructure is becoming more complex and we may be reliant on orchestration and interoperability with third party vendors on whom we are reliant for testing and support of new product versions and configurations. if we are unable to identify, develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis, our business and results of operations may be harmed.
the current development cycle for our products is on average 12-24 months. the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction, and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products. this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales, increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence. we have also experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements. this has led to, and may in the future lead to, delayed sales, increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated. also, in the development of our products, we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products, which in turn has led to delays in product introductions. in addition, complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the end-of-life stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses. any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations.
our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery controller and application security product lines we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our application delivery controller (adc) and application security products in the future. implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability, performance and security problems for our customers. if our products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in product feature sets needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment, our business and results of operations will be harmed.
security vulnerabilities in our it systems or products as well as unforeseen product errors could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations, financial condition and reputation in the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal data, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners on our networks. in addition, we store sensitive data through cloud-based services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties. the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. our information systems and those of our partners and customers are subject to the increasing threat of intrusions by a wide range of actors including computer programmers, hackers or sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors or they may be compromised due to employee error or wrongful conduct, malfeasance, or other disruptions. despite our security measures, and those of our third-party vendors, our information technology and infrastructure has experienced breaches or disruptions and may be vulnerable in the future to breach, attacks or disruptions. if any breach or attack compromises our networks, creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products, the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed and modified, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, and we may be subject to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, and suffer reputational and financial harm.
in addition, our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as well as our internal it systems. as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions, we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products or it systems.
we devote significant resources to addressing security vulnerabilities in our it systems, product solutions and services through our efforts to engineer more secure solutions and services, enhance security and reliability features in our solutions and services, deploy security updates to address security vulnerabilities and seek to respond to known security incidents in sufficient time to minimize any potential adverse impact. despite our efforts to harden our infrastructure and build secure solutions, from time to time, we experience attacks and other cyber-threats. these attacks can seek to exploit, among other things, known or unknown vulnerabilities in technology included in our it infrastructure, solutions and services. while we have undertaken efforts to mitigate these vulnerabilities, they could render our internal systems, products, and solutions and services susceptible to a cyber-attack.
our products may also contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released. we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades. as our products and customer it infrastructures become increasingly complex, customers may experience unforeseen errors in implementing our products into their it environments. we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments. these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems. we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects. while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability, these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted. a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations.
our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors. as a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. the occurrence of software or hardware problems, whether caused by our products or another vendor's products, may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations.
any errors, defects or vulnerabilities in our products or it systems could result in:
•expenditures of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work-around errors and defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;
•remediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs or system damage;
•increased cybersecurity protection costs which may include systems and technology changes, training, and engagement of third party experts and consultants;
•increased insurance premiums;
•loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners;
•loss of proprietary information leading to lost competitive positioning and lost revenues;
•negative publicity and damage to our reputation;
•delayed or lost revenue;
•delay or failure to attain market acceptance;
•an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect our gross margins; and
•litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation.
we are dependent on various information technology systems, and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business many of our business processes depend upon our it systems, the systems and processes of third parties, and on interfaces with the systems of third parties. for example, our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers, which enables them to build and ship our products. if those systems fail or are interrupted, or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted, our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all. this would harm our ability to ship products, and our financial results may be harmed.
in addition, reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be time-consuming and costly. to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities, our financial results may be harmed.
our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business a wide variety of local, state, national, and international laws, directives and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. these data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance. certain safe-harbor exemptions upon which the company relies for data transfers have been challenged and may no longer be available to us in the future. our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by end-customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing end-customers and prospective end-customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the european union, the united states, and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of ip addresses, machine identification, location data, and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. the evolving data protection regulatory environment may require significant management attention and financial resources to analyze and modify our it infrastructure to meet these changing requirements all of which could reduce our operating margins and impact our operating results and financial condition.
our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire, retain and motivate qualified executives, sales and marketing, operations, product development and professional services personnel our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, engage, retain, and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and equity-based compensation. if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. we have recently experienced changes in our senior leadership team and we expect to continue to see changes as we build the team that is needed to execute our strategy. changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. the complexity of our products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support, as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort, requires us to retain highly trained developers, professional services, customer support and sales personnel. competition for qualified developers, professional services, customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense, especially in silicon valley and seattle where we have substantial operations and a need for highly skilled personnel, because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products. also, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, that they have violated non-compete obligations to their prior employers, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product. our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock or our ability to get approval from shareholders to offer additional common stock to our employees, since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units. the loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations. in addition, we recently announced a restructuring to re-align our workforce to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth, including a reduction in force program impacting a number of employees. this restructuring could lead to increased attrition amongst those employees who were not directly affected by the reduction in force program.
we recently implemented a restructuring program, which we cannot guarantee will achieve its intended result in the first fiscal quarter of 2020, we completed a restructuring program to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth. we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans, and our restructuring activities may subject us to litigation risks and expenses. our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future. in addition, our restructuring plans may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us. as a result, our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future.
the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase, which may negatively impact revenues and profits it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures, increased sales discounts, new product introductions by us or our competitors, as well as the shift to more software consumption based and "as a service based" models, or other factors. therefore, in order to maintain our profits, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs. our failure to do so could cause our revenue and profits to decline, which would harm our business and results of operations. in addition, we may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices.
our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications. we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past. however, if we experience major delays in the future or other problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product, any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations. the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations. in particular, we currently subcontract manufacturing of our products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a long-term contract. if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired, and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.
if the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases, contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions. any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue, may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers.
our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our third-party sources we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources. lead times for these components vary significantly. the unavailability of suitable components, any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, may delay assembly and sales of our products and, hence, our revenues, and may harm our business and results of operations.
it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict. historically, our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as our products become increasingly complex. also, as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model, utilizing value-added resellers, distributors and systems integrators, the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions. sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits. sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require. for example, customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase. customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us. as a result, our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results.
we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships, and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally, including leading industry distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, service providers and other indirect channel partners. we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels, and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships. recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources. these channel partners may also market, sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales and support of such competitive products. our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies. if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in addition, one worldwide distributor of our products accounted for 16.7% of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2020. a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners, if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks sales to u.s. and foreign, federal, state, and local governmental agency end-customers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities. sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners. government certification requirements for products like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services. government entities may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results. governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors' administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services, a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way. finally, for purchases by the u.s. government, the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the u.s. government, affecting our ability to sell these products to the u.s. government.
misuse of our products could harm our reputation our products may be misused by end-customers or third parties that obtain access to our products. for example, our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet. such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation. in addition, as many of our products are subject to export control regulations, diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations, penalties, fines, trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may cause our stock price to fluctuate our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the changing and recently volatile u.s. and global economic environment, which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. in particular, we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts. a delay in the recognition of revenue, even from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period. in the past, a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter. accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that fiscal year. additionally, we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and sub-tenants. although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately. we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements, seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses. if there is a deterioration of a sub-tenant's or a major customer's creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. further, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years. our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock. such a decline could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenue and/or earnings guidance.
reliance on fulfillment at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter. in addition, any significant interruption in our information technology systems, which manage critical functions such as order processing, revenue recognition, financial forecasts, inventory and supply chain management, and trade compliance reviews, could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter. if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize, our third party contract manufacturers' inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter, our failure to manage inventory to meet demand, our inability to release new products on schedule, any failure of our systems related to order review and processing, or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements, our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.
changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future. changes to existing rules, or changes to the interpretations of existing rules, could lead to changes in our accounting practices, and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected as a public company, we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting, which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm. we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs, implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements. if in the future, our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness, investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.
we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be affected by changes in our business operations, including acquisitions, new offerings, and changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate. the provision for income taxes may also be impacted by changes in stock-based compensation, changes in the research and development tax credit laws, earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, transfer pricing adjustments, not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in actual results versus our estimates, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, including changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. our results of operations and cash flows could be affected by future guidance implementing the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act. in addition, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service and other tax authorities. while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets our products are subject to u.s. export controls and may be exported outside the u.s. only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products. in addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers' ability to implement our products in those countries. changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states.
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. in the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims and such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur. also, as we have gained greater visibility, market exposure and competitive success, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, or if we otherwise settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights. any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all or may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimate, if any, which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses. similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical. in addition, we have initiated, and may in the future initiate, claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors. any of these claims, whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others, or vice versa, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology, develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. further, our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers, distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology, which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers, distributors or resellers. any of the above-described circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed.
we incorporate open source software into our products. although we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by u.s. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products. in either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties. in the future, it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology. these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. the inability to obtain certain licenses, or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. furthermore, we license some third party intellectual property on a non-exclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products.
our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce as our international sales increase, our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks. additionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:
•greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;
•the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
•greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties;
•risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including the importation, certification, and localization of our products required in foreign countries;
•greater risk of a failure of foreign employees, partners, distributors, and resellers to comply with both u.s. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;
•heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements;
•increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;
•greater difficulty in recruiting local experienced personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;
•management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;
•fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business;
•economic uncertainty around the world, including continued economic uncertainty as a result of sovereign debt issues in europe; and
•general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets.
in addition, in june 2016, voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union (commonly referred to as brexit). the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdom's withdrawal and its consequences, may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our products and services.
we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations. to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing, and retaining an international staff, and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel, we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets. we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence. if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships, our future success in these international markets could be limited. business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts. we intend to continue expanding into international markets. sales outside of the americas represented 44.0% and 44.5% of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business.
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations our sales contracts are denominated in u.s. dollars, and therefore, substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. however, a strengthening of the u.s. dollar could increase the real cost of our solutions to our end customers outside of the united states, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. in addition, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states, is denominated in foreign currencies, and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our operating results could be adversely affected. to date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative instruments.
changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including, but not limited to, environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology. changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals, permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues, business and operations.
new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products in august 2012, the sec adopted new requirements under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (or the dodd-frank act) for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals (referred to as conflict minerals, regardless of their country of origin) in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. the dodd-frank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries. we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 29, 2020. these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. in addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products. we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. as a result, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk.
we face litigation risks we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. litigation in general, and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular, can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. responding to lawsuits has been, and will likely continue to be, expensive and time-consuming for us. an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction with respect to our past acquisitions, as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake, we may find that the acquired businesses, products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected, that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change, all of which may generate future impairment charges. our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business, and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business. we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines. our ongoing business and management's attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations. we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across locations. we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality, technology and other matters.
our inability to successfully operate and integrate newly-acquired businesses appropriately, effectively and in a timely manner, or to retain key personnel of any acquired business, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology, as well as on our revenues, gross margins and expenses.
anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. further, certain provisions of our bylaws, including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. similarly, state anti-takeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company.
our stock price could be volatile, particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past. the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future. some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include:
•actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results;
•analyst reports or recommendations;
•rumors, announcements or press articles regarding our competitors' operations, management, organization, financial condition or financial statements; and
•other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.
the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment.
if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, or discontinue publishing research about our business, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our securities to decline.
we face risks associated with having operations and employees located in israel we have offices and employees located in israel. as a result, political, economic, and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations. the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors remains uncertain. there has been a significant increase in hostilities and political unrest in israel in the past year. the effects of these hostilities and violence on the israeli economy and our operations in israel are unclear, and we cannot predict the effect on us of further increases in these hostilities or future armed conflict, political instability or violence in the region. in addition, many of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances. we cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future, particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs. if many of our employees in israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time, our operations and our business could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity. current or future tensions and conflicts in the middle east could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a fire, a flood, or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area, a region known for seismic activity. in addition, natural disasters could affect our supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers' ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis. in the event our or our service providers' information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. in addition, cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, or other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners, or end-customers or the economy as a whole. any disruption in the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end-customers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results. all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the delay in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.
the effects of a pandemic or widespread health epidemic such as the coronavirus outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in march 2020, the world health organization declared covid-19 a global pandemic. the impact on the global population and the duration of the covid-19 pandemic is difficult to assess or predict and depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or effectively respond to, including, without limitation: the duration and scope of the outbreak; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the outbreak; the effect on economic activity and actions taken in response.
while our analysis shows covid-19 did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020, the impacts of the global pandemic on our business and financial outlook are currently unknown. areas that may or may not be adversely disrupted or impacted by the covid-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to: customer demand for our products and services, reductions in customer spend, delayed or the inability to collect from our customers, disruptions to our supply chain that could result in delays, shortages or increased costs of our products, disruptions to our operations in servicing our customers as a result of working remotely or business location closures, which all may adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods.
in addition to other risks listed in this "risk factors" section, factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to:
•fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to changing market conditions, pricing conditions, technology evolution, seasonality, or other changes in the global economic environment;
•changes or fluctuations in sales and implementation cycles for our products and services;
•changes in the mix of our products and services, including increases in subscription-based offerings;
•changes in the growth rate of the application delivery market;
•reduced visibility into our customers' spending and implementation plans;
•reductions in customers' budgets for data center and other it purchases or delays in these purchases;
•changes in end-user customer attach rates and renewal rates for our services;
•fluctuations in our gross margins, including the factors described herein, which may contribute to such fluctuations;
•our ability to control costs, including operating expenses, the costs of hardware and software components, and other manufacturing costs;
•our ability to develop, introduce and gain market acceptance of new products, technologies and services, and our success in new and evolving markets;
•any significant changes in the competitive environment, including the entry of new competitors or the substantial discounting of products or services;
•the timing and execution of product transitions or new product introductions, and related inventory costs;
•variations in sales channels, product costs, or mix of products sold;
•our ability to establish and manage our distribution channels, and the effectiveness of any changes we make to our distribution model;
•the ability of our contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide component parts, hardware platforms and other products in a timely manner;
•benefits anticipated from our investments in sales, marketing, product development, manufacturing or other activities;
•impacts on our overall tax rate caused by any reorganization in our corporate structure;
•changes in tax laws or regulations, or other accounting rules; and
•general economic conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets.

overview f5 is a leading provider of multi-cloud application services which enable our customers to develop, deploy, operate, secure, and govern applications in any architecture, from on-premises to the public cloud. our enterprise-grade application services are available as cloud-based, software-as-a-service, and software-only solutions optimized for multi-cloud environments, with modules that can run independently, or as part of an integrated solution on our high-performance appliances. we market and sell our products primarily through multiple indirect sales channels in the americas (primarily the united states); europe, the middle east, and africa (emea); and the asia pacific region (apac). enterprise customers (fortune 1000 or business week global 1000 companies) in the technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing, and health care industries, along with government customers, continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base.
on january 24, 2020, we completed the acquisition of shape security, a provider of fraud and abuse prevention solutions. together, f5 and shape represent an end-to-end application security solution, reducing infrastructure complexity while protecting every aspect of the 'code to customer' journey against losses from online fraud, reputational damage, and disruptions to critical online services.
our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance on a consolidated basis. those indicators include:
•revenues. the majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our application delivery controller (adc) products including our big-ip appliances and viprion chassis and related software modules and our software-only virtual editions; local traffic manager (ltm), dns services (formerly global traffic manager); advanced firewall manager (afm) and policy enforcement manager (pem), that leverage the unique performance characteristics of our hardware and software architecture; and products that incorporate acquired technology, including application security manager (asm) and access policy manager (apm); nginx plus and nginx controller; shape defense and enterprise defense; and the secure web gateway and silverline ddos and application security offerings which are sold to customers on a subscription basis. we also derive revenues from the sales of services including annual maintenance contracts, training and consulting services. we carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period. we believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are indicators of future trends. we also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends. we are also monitoring the uncertainty related to the impacts that the covid-19 pandemic has on the global economy and our customer base.
•cost of revenues and gross margins. we strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins. significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third-party software license fees, software-as-a-service infrastructure, amortization of developed technology and personnel and overhead expenses. our margins have remained relatively stable; however, factors such as sales price, product and services mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases, warranty costs, and the uncertainty surrounding the covid-19 pandemic and its potential impacts to our supply chain could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis.
•operating expenses. operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses. existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends. other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees, computer costs related to the development of new products and provision of services, facilities and depreciation expenses.
•liquidity and cash flows. our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments. the decrease in cash and cash equivalents for fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to $955.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of shape in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as $100.0 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2020 and $59.9 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide as well as investments in information technology infrastructure and equipment purchases to support our core business activities. going forward, we believe the primary driver of cash flows will be net income from operations. the decrease in cash and cash equivalents for fiscal year 2020 was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $660.9 million and $400.0 million in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt in connection with our acquisition of shape. we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe are strategic, which may require the use of cash. additionally, on january 31, 2020, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the "revolving credit agreement") that provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the "revolving credit facility"). we have the option to increase commitments under the revolving credit facility from time to time, subject to certain conditions, by up to $150.0 million. as of september 30, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and we had available borrowing capacity of $350.0 million.
•balance sheet. we view cash, short-term and long-term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health. deferred revenues continued to increase in fiscal 2020 due to the growth of our subscriptions business, including the acquired deferred revenue associated with the shape acquisition. our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 was 43. days sales outstanding is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable by revenue per day for a given quarter.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that, of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition. on october 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard by applying the modified retrospective approach to those contracts which were not completed as of october 1, 2018. results for reporting periods beginning after october 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue recognition standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior periods.
we sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly to end users. revenue related to our contracts with customers is recognized by following a five-step process:
•identify the contract(s) with a customer. evidence of a contract generally consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a distributor, reseller or end user agreement.
•identify the performance obligations in the contract. performance obligations are identified in our contracts and include hardware, hardware-based software, software-only solutions, cloud-based subscription services as well as a broad range of service performance obligations including consulting, training, installation and maintenance.
•determine the transaction price. the purchase price stated in an agreed upon purchase order is generally representative of the transaction price. we offer several programs in which customers are eligible for certain levels of rebates if certain conditions are met. when determining the transaction price, we consider the effects of any variable consideration.
•allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. the transaction price in a contract is allocated based upon the relative standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation identified in the contract.
•recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. we satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time as discussed in further detail below. revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of promised products and services to a customer.
the following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue:
product revenue from the sale of our hardware and perpetual software products is generally recognized at a point in time when the product has been fulfilled and the customer is obligated to pay for the product. we also offer several products by subscription, either through term-based license agreements or as a service through our cloud-based platform. revenue for term-based license agreements is recognized at a point in time, when we deliver the software license to the customer and the subscription term has commenced. for our software-as-a-service offerings, revenue is recognized ratably as the services are provided. hardware, including the software run on those devices is considered systems revenue. perpetual or subscription software offerings that are deployed on a standalone basis, along with software sold as a service are considered software revenue. when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse. payment terms to customers are generally net 30 days to net 60 days.
services revenues for post-contract customer support (pcs) are recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract term. pcs includes a limited period of telephone support, updates, repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement, bug fixes and rights to upgrades, when and if available. consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates, plus out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized as the consulting is completed. similarly, training revenue is recognized as the training is completed.
contract acquisition costs sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. sales commissions for initial service contracts and subscription offerings are deferred and then amortized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit which management has determined to be 4.5 years and 3 years, respectively.
significant judgments we enter into certain contracts with customers, including enterprise license arrangements, with non-standard terms and conditions. management exercises significant judgment in assessing contractual terms in these arrangements to identify and evaluate performance obligations and total consideration. management allocates consideration to each performance obligation based on relative fair value using standalone selling price and recognizes associated revenue as control is transferred to the customer.
business combinations. our business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
on january 24, 2020, we completed our acquisition of shape security, inc. for a total purchase price of $1.0 billion, of which approximately $120.0 million of finite-lived developed technology was recorded. management valued the developed technology using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the acquired developed technology, which involved the use of a significant assumption with respects to the revenue growth rate and technology migration curve.
covid-19 update management has prioritized a human-first approach to the covid-19 pandemic. for f5, this means ensuring the health and safety of employees, their families and our communities. further, this approach extends to our customers as we look for ways that we can support their operations during this crisis.
while our analysis shows covid-19 did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020, the impacts of the global pandemic on our business and financial outlook are currently unknown. we are conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and virtualization or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events, among other modifications. we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders. it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers and prospects, or on our financial results.
results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

net revenues. total net revenues increased 4.8% in fiscal year 2020 from fiscal year 2019, compared to an increase of 3.7% in fiscal year 2019 from the prior year. overall revenue growth for the year ended september 30, 2020 was due to increased product and service revenue. the product revenue increase was driven by software revenue increases, specifically from the addition of the software-as-a-service product offerings through the shape acquisition and our subscription-based offerings, which include our enterprise license agreement product offerings. service revenues increased as a result of our increased installed base of products. revenues outside of the united states represented 48.1%, 49.3% and 49.6% of net revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
net product revenues. net product revenues increased 4.1% in fiscal year 2020 from fiscal year 2019, compared to an increase of 2.7% in fiscal year 2019 from the prior year. the increase of $40.3 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2020 was due to an increase in software sales compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in systems revenue. the increase of $25.5 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase in software sales compared to the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in systems revenue.

other income, net. other income, net, consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. other income, net decreased $18.5 million in fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019 and increased $9.8 million in fiscal year 2019, as compared to fiscal year 2018. the decrease in other income, net for fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease of $13.1 million in interest income from our investments compared to the same period in the prior year. in addition, interest expense increased $7.5 million for fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior year as a result of $400.0 million of debt issued as part of our acquisition of shape in january 2020. the increase in other income, net for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $8.3 million in interest income, compared to the prior year, and foreign currency gains of $1.8 million, compared to the prior year.
provision for income taxes. we recorded a 22.4% provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2020, compared to 21.0% in fiscal year 2019 and 24.9% in fiscal year 2018. the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to an increase in the tax impact from stock based compensation and other non-deductible expenses. the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to a further reduction in the u.s. federal income tax rate to 21%, the non-recurring tax expense recorded in fiscal year 2018 for deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of net deferred tax assets, partially offset by a decrease in tax deductible stock compensation.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. in making these determinations we consider historical and projected taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. the net increase in the valuation allowance of $9.1 million for fiscal year 2020 and $0.7 million for fiscal year 2019 was primarily related to tax net operating losses and credits incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions and state tax carryforwards. our net deferred tax assets as of september 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $44.6 million, $27.4 million, and $33.4 million respectively.
our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including variations in projected taxable income in the various geographic locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate, and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate. we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense.
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations with our cash balances, cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities.

cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments totaled $1,312.8 million as of september 30, 2020, compared to $1,330.7 million as of september 30, 2019, representing a decrease of $17.9 million. the decrease was primarily due to $955.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of shape in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as $100.0 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2020 and $59.9 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide as well as investments in information technology infrastructure and equipment purchases to support our core business activities. the decrease was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $660.9 million and $400.0 million in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt in connection with our acquisition of shape. as of september 30, 2020, 59.1% of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the u.s. the cash and cash equivalents and investment balances outside of the u.s. are subject to fluctuation based on the settlement of intercompany balances. in fiscal year 2019, the decrease to cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments from the prior year was primarily due to $611.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of nginx in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as well as $201.0 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2019 and $103.5 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide. as of september 30, 2019, 55.8% of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the u.s.
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2020 was $660.9 million compared to $747.8 million in fiscal year 2019 and $761.1 million in fiscal year 2018. cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the covid-19 pandemic and other risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled "risk factors". however, we anticipate our current cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, anticipated cash flows generated from operations, and available borrowing capacity on the revolver credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.
cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2020 was $747.0 million compared to cash used in investing activities of $414.6 million in fiscal year 2019 and cash used in investing activities of $456.0 million in fiscal year 2018. cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2020 was primarily the result of $955.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of shape, along with capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and the purchase of investments, partially offset by the maturity and sale of investments. cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2019 was primarily the result of $611.6 million in cash paid for the acquisition of nginx, along with capital expenditures related to the build-out of our new corporate headquarters and the purchase of investments, partially offset by the maturity and sale of investments. cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2018 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide, partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments.
cash provided by financing activities was $337.2 million for fiscal year 2020, compared to cash used in financing activities of $155.4 million for fiscal year 2019 and $551.3 million for fiscal year 2018. cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2020 included $400.0 million in cash proceeds from a term loan, as well as cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of $52.8 million, partially offset by $100.0 million in cash used to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program and $10.0 million in cash used to make a principal payment on our term loan. cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2019 included $201.0 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of $45.6 million. cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2018 included $600.1 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of $48.8 million.
on january 31, 2020, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the "revolving credit agreement") that provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the "revolving credit facility"). we have the option to increase commitments under the revolving credit facility from time to time, subject to certain conditions, by up to $150.0 million. as of september 30, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and we had available borrowing capacity of $350.0 million.
based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that our existing cash and investment balances, together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products, the continuing market acceptance of our products and cash paid for future acquisitions.
obligations and commitments as of september 30, 2020, we had approximately $54.8 million of tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions (see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements). because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur.
as of september 30, 2020, our principal commitments consisted of borrowings under the term loan facility and obligations outstanding under operating leases.
in connection with the acquisition of shape, on january 24, 2020, we entered into a term credit agreement ("term credit agreement") with certain institutional lenders that provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million (the "term loan facility"). the proceeds from the term loan facility were primarily used to finance the acquisition of shape and related expenses. as of september 30, 2020, $390.0 million of principal amount under the term loan facility was outstanding. there is a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a leverage ratio, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda. this covenant may result in a higher interest rate on our outstanding principal borrowings on the term loan facility in future periods, depending on the company's performance. we will monitor the effect that the covid-19 pandemic may have on our leverage ratio calculation but do not believe there will be a material impact to the interest payable on our borrowings under the term loan facility. refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for the scheduled principal maturities of the term loan facility as of september 30, 2020.
we outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware platforms to contract manufacturers who assemble each product to our specifications. our agreement with our largest contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast. we are contractually obligated to purchase the component inventory in accordance with the forecast, unless we give notice of order cancellation in advance of applicable lead times.
recently adopted accounting standards in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09). asu 2014-09 and the related amendments outline a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. the new model requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. we adopted this new accounting standard and the related amendments on october 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. refer to note 2 - revenue from contracts with customers for further discussion.
in february 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asu 2016-02), which requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a corresponding lease liability for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. our leases consist primarily of operating leases for our offices and lab spaces. we do not have finance leases. the guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. we adopted this standard on october 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis by applying the new standard to our lease portfolio as of october 1, 2019. under the modified retrospective method, financial results reported in periods prior to fiscal 2020 are unchanged. as a result of the adoption of this standard, we recognized lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for our long-term leases for office space, which had a material impact to our consolidated balance sheets. the adoption of this standard had no impact on the consolidated income statements and consolidated statements of cash flows. refer to note 8 - leases for further discussion.
upon adoption of the standard, we elected the package of three practical expedients for existing and expired contracts to not reassess: the existence of additional leases, lease classification, or the treatment of initial direct costs. we also apply the short-term lease exemption for leases with an original expected term of 12 months or less and expense such leases month-to-month and do not record a right-of-use asset or lease liability. short-term lease activity under the exception is not significant. additionally, we do not separate lease and non-lease components in the allocation of minimum lease payments for our office space and equipment leases, as such separation is not significant.
we include in minimum lease payments, fixed and variable payments based on a rate or index, but exclude variable payments based on satisfying future benchmarks or actual future costs incurred; such amounts are expensed as incurred. to calculate the net present value, we apply an incremental borrowing rate. this incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. renewal options to extend lease terms are excluded from the minimum lease term at lease commencement.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (asu 2016-13), which modifies the accounting for credit losses for most financial assets and requires the use of an expected loss model, replacing the currently used incurred loss method. under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. the new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption is permitted. we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in august 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-15, intangibles - goodwill and other - internal-use software (subtopic 350-40) (asu 2018-15), which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software, and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license. the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this update. the new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption is permitted. we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

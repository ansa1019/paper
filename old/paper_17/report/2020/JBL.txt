item 1a. risk factors operational risks the effect of covid-19 on our operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers and logistics providers has, and is expected to continue to have, a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
our global operations expose us to the covid-19 pandemic, which has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our employees, operations, supply chain and distribution system. while we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. to date, covid-19 has increased our expenses, primarily related to additional labor costs and the procurement of personal protection equipment for our employees globally, and has caused a reduction in factory utilization due to travel disruptions and restrictions. covid-19 has now spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity, including our global manufacturing production sites. public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid-19, including travel restrictions and quarantines, are impacting our operations, including affecting the ability of our employees to get to our facilities, reducing capacity utilization levels, causing certain facility or intermittent business closures, and interrupting the movement or increasing the cost of moving components and products through our supply chain.  if additional factory closures are required or reductions in capacity utilization levels occur, we expect to incur additional direct costs and lost revenue. if our suppliers experience additional closures or reductions in their capacity utilization levels in the future, we may have difficulty sourcing materials necessary to fulfill production requirements. covid-19 has also impacted our customers and may create unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for our manufacturing services. our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees. the ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid-19. while we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees, these measures may not be successful, and we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures. in addition, responding to the continuing pandemic could divert management's attention from our key strategic priorities, cause us to reduce, delay, alter or abandon initiatives that may otherwise increase our long-term value or otherwise disrupt our business operations. while we are staying in close communication with our sites, employees, customers, suppliers and logistics partners and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation, the duration and extent of the effect of covid-19 on jabil is not determinable. we believe covid-19 will continue to have a material and adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the near term. in addition, the impact of the covid-19 pandemic could exacerbate the other risks we face.
if we do not manage our growth effectively, our profitability could decline.
our business at times experiences periods of rapid growth which can place considerable demands upon our management team and our operational, financial and management information systems. our ability to manage growth effectively requires us to continue to implement and improve these systems; avoid cost overruns; maintain customer, supplier and other favorable business relationships during transition periods; efficiently and effectively dedicate resources to existing customers as well as new projects; acquire or construct additional facilities; occasionally transfer operations to different facilities; acquire equipment in anticipation of demand; continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors; adapt relatively quickly to new markets or technologies and continue to hire, train, motivate and manage our employees. our failure to effectively manage growth, as well as our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the actions we take to try to manage our growth, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of those customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue.
we currently depend, and expect to continue to depend for the foreseeable future, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth, viability and financial stability. see "business - the company." in some instances, particular manufacturing services we provide for a customer represent a significant portion of the overall revenue we receive from that customer. as a result of this concentration, a reduction in business from one or more of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, if one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or otherwise become unable to pay us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
consolidation among our customers exposes us to increased risks, including reduced revenue and dependence on a smaller number of customers. increasing consolidation in industries that utilize our services may occur as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies, which could result in an increase in excess manufacturing capacity as companies seek to divest manufacturing operations or eliminate duplicative product lines. excess manufacturing capacity may increase pricing and competitive pressures for our industry as a whole and for us in particular. such consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our net revenue and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers.
our customers face numerous competitive challenges, which may materially adversely affect their business and ours.
factors adversely affecting our customers may also adversely affect us. these factors include:
•   recessionary periods in our customers' markets;
•   the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards, which may contribute to short product life cycles or shifts in our customers' strategies;
•   the inability of our customers to develop, market or gain commercial acceptance of their products, some of which are new and untested;
•   the potential that our customers' products become commoditized or obsolete;
•   loss of business or a reduction in pricing power experienced by our customers;
•   the emergence of new business models or more popular products and shifting patterns of demand; and
•   a highly-competitive consumer products industry, which is often subject to shorter product lifecycles, shifting end-user preferences and higher revenue volatility.
if our customers are unsuccessful in addressing these competitive challenges, their businesses may be materially adversely affected, reducing the demand for our services, decreasing our revenues or altering our production cycles and inventory management, each of which could adversely affect our ability to cover fixed costs and our gross profit margins and results of operations.
most of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, and they may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and manage capital expenditures and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity.
most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter. we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules and locations, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements. our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. in the past, we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand. on occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production for one or more of their products or request that we relocate our manufacturing operations or transfer manufacturing from one facility to another, which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins.
customers have canceled their orders, changed production quantities or designs, delayed production, changed their sourcing strategy and terminated their relationships with us. we cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their service arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce, cancel or delay the amount of services ordered. such changes, delays and cancellations have led to, and may lead in the future to a decline in our production and our possession of excess or obsolete inventory that we may not be able to sell to customers or third parties. this may result in write downs of inventories, reduction in the number of products that we sell, delays in payment for inventory that we purchased, and reductions in the use of our manufacturing facilities. as many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand, particularly a reduction in demand for a product that represents a significant amount of revenue, can harm our gross profit margins and results of operations.
in addition, we sometimes experience difficulty forecasting the timing of our receipt of payment from customers. the necessary process to begin manufacturing can be lengthy. because we make capital expenditures during this ramping-up process and do not receive payment until after we produce and ship the customer's products, any delays or unanticipated costs in the ramping-up process may have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows and our results of operations. servicing our largest customers may also require us to increase our capital expenditures.
customer relationships with emerging companies may present more risks than with established companies.
customer relationships with emerging companies present special risks because we do not have an extensive product or customer relationship history. there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products making it harder for us to anticipate requirements than with established customers. our credit risk on these customers, especially in trade accounts receivable and inventories, and the risk that these customers will be unable to fulfill indemnification obligations to us are potentially increased. we sometimes offer these customers extended payment terms, loans and other support and financial accommodations which may increase our financial exposure.
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and competitive conditions in our industry, and our ability to effectively adapt our services as our customers react to technological changes and competitive conditions in their respective industries.
if we are unable to offer technologically advanced, cost effective, quick response manufacturing services that are differentiated from our competition and adapt those services as our customers' requirements change, demand for our services will decline.
introducing new business models or programs requiring implementation of new competencies, such as new process technologies and our development of new products or services for customers, could affect our operations and financial results.
the introduction of new business models or programs requiring implementation or development of new competencies, such as new process technology within our operations and our independent development of new products or services for customers, presents challenges in addition to opportunities. the success of new business models or programs depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, a sufficient understanding of the new business or markets, timely and successful product development (by us and/or our customer), market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, our development or acquisition of appropriate intellectual property, the availability of supplies in adequate quantities and at appropriate costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, we cannot determine in advance the ultimate result of new business models or programs.
as a result, we must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our assumptions will accurately reflect customer demand for our services or for our customer's products. after the development of a new business model or program, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low cost. to accomplish this, we endeavor to accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements; however, we may not succeed at doing so.
we compete with numerous other diversified manufacturing service providers, electronic manufacturing services and design providers and others.
our business is highly competitive and our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection. we compete against numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturers, manufacturing service providers and design providers. the significant purchasing power and market power of these large companies could increase pricing and competitive pressures for us. most of our competitors have international operations and significant financial resources and some have substantially greater manufacturing, research and development (r&d) and marketing resources. these competitors may:
•   respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements;
•   have technological expertise, engineering capabilities and/or manufacturing resources that are greater than ours;
•   have greater name recognition, critical mass and geographic market presence;
•   be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities;
•   devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services and execution of their strategy;
•   be better positioned to compete on price for their services;
•   have excess capacity, and be better able to utilize such excess capacity;
•   have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers;
•   have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide;
•   be willing or able to make sales or provide services at lower margins than we do;
•   have increased vertical capabilities providing them greater cost savings.
we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. in the past, some of our customers moved a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity.
the actions of competitors and current and potential customers could cause a decline in our sales and/or compression of our profits.
our business could be adversely affected by any delays, or increased costs, resulting from common carrier or transportation issues.
we rely on a variety of common carriers to transport our materials from our suppliers and to our customers. problems suffered by any of these common carriers, including natural disaster, pandemic, labor problems, increased energy prices, or criminal activity, could result in shipping delays for products or materials, increased costs or other supply chain disruptions, and could therefore have a negative impact on our ability to receive products from suppliers and deliver products to customers, resulting in a material adverse effect on our operations.
we may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise.
many of the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to:
•   hire, retain and expand our pool of qualified engineering and technical personnel;
•   maintain and continually improve our technological expertise;
•   develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs; and
•   anticipate and respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis.
although we use the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. the emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive. the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment and the offering of new or additional services to our customers may require significant expense or capital investment, which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results. in facilities that we newly establish or acquire, we may not be able to insert or maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise. our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers' changing technological needs and requirements or to hire sufficient personnel to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we depend on attracting and retaining officers, managers and skilled personnel.
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our officers, managers and skilled personnel. these employees are not generally bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain them. to aid in managing our growth and strengthening our pool of management and skilled personnel, we will need to internally develop, recruit and retain skilled management personnel. if we are not able to do so, our business and our ability to continue to grow could be harmed.
efficient component and material purchasing is critical to our manufacturing processes and contractual arrangements. a shortage of components or an increase in price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profit, increase our inventory carrying costs, increase our risk of exposure to inventory obsolescence and cause us to purchase components of a lesser quality.
strategic and efficient component and materials purchasing is an aspect of our strategy. when prices rise, they may impact our margins and results of operations if we are not able to pass the increases through to our customers or otherwise offset them. most of our significant long-term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic prospective adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors; however, we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re-pricings or, if such re-pricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to purchase the components and materials needed to manufacture customer products at favorable prices. accordingly, certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins and results of operations.
some of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are only available from a single source. some of these components are subject to supply shortages from time to time. in some cases, supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component. a supply shortage can also increase our cost of goods sold if we have to pay higher prices for components in limited supply, or cause us to have to redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate a substitute component. in the past there have been industry wide conditions, natural disasters and global events that have caused material shortages. our production of a customer's product could be negatively impacted by any quality, reliability or availability issues with any of our component suppliers. the financial condition of our suppliers could affect their ability to supply us with components and their ability to satisfy any warranty obligations they may have, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
if a component shortage is threatened or anticipated, we may purchase such components early to avoid a delay or interruption in our operations. purchasing components early may cause us to incur additional inventory carrying costs and may cause us to experience inventory obsolescence, both of which may not be recoverable from our customers and could adversely affect our gross profit margins and net income. a component shortage may also require us to look to second tier vendors or to procure components through brokers with whom we are not familiar. these components may be of lesser quality than those we have historically purchased and could cause us to incur costs to bring such components up to our quality levels or to replace defective ones. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and "business - components procurement."
we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of different risks and often require more management time and expense than our domestic operations.
our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
•   difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and attempting to ensure compliance with our policies, procedures, and applicable local laws;
•   less flexible employee relationships that can be difficult and expensive to terminate due to, among other things, labor laws and regulations;
•   rising labor costs (including the introduction or expansion of certain social programs), in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate, due to, among other things, demographic changes and economic development in those regions;
•   labor unrest and dissatisfaction, including potential labor strikes or claims;
•   increased scrutiny by the media and other third parties of labor practices within our industry (including working conditions, compliance with employment and labor laws and compensation) which may result in allegations of violations, more stringent and burdensome labor laws and regulations, higher labor costs and/or loss of revenues if our customers become dissatisfied with our labor practices and diminish or terminate their relationship with us;
•   burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, domestic and foreign import and export controls, trade barriers (including tariffs and quotas), environmental policies and privacy issues, and local statutory corporate governance rules;
•   risk of non-compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") or similar regulations in other jurisdictions;
•   less favorable, less predictable, or relatively undefined, intellectual property laws;
•   lack of sufficient or available locations from which to operate or inability to renew leases on terms that are acceptable to us or at all;
•   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws or government or judicial interpretations of such regulatory requirements and laws and adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the u.s. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;
•   adverse changes in tax rates or accounting rules and the manner in which the u.s. and other countries tax multinational companies or interpret their tax laws or accounting rules or restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the u.s.;
•   limitations on imports or exports of components or products, or other trade sanctions;
•   political and economic instability and unsafe working conditions;
•   risk of governmental expropriation of our property;
•   inadequate infrastructure for our operations (e.g., lack of adequate power, water, transportation and raw materials);
•   legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;
•   health concerns, epidemics and related government actions;
•   increased travel costs and difficulty in coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones;
•   longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting trade accounts receivable;
•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•   economies that are emerging or developing or that may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks; and
•   international trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect our business. tariffs could increase the costs of the components and raw materials we use in the manufacturing process as well as import and export costs for finished products. countries could adopt other protectionist measures that could limit our ability to manufacture products or provide services. increased costs to our u.s. customers who use our non-u.s. manufacturing sites and components may adversely impact demand for our services and our results of operation and financial condition. additionally, international trade disputes may cause our customers to decide to relocate the manufacturing of their products to another location, either within country, or into a new country. relocations may require considerable management time as well as expenses related to market, personnel and facilities development before any significant revenue is generated, which may negatively affect our margin. furthermore, there can be no assurance that all customer manufacturing needs can be met in available locations within the desired timeframe, or at all, which may cause us to lose business, which may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.
in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing, design, support and storage operations are conducted in our facilities in china, and revenues associated with our china operations are important to our success. therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by economic, political, legal, regulatory, competitive and other factors in china. international trade disputes with china could result in tariffs and other measures that could adversely affect the company's business. the chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement and control over economic growth. in addition, our operations in china are governed by chinese laws, rules and regulations, some of which are relatively new. the chinese legal system continues to rapidly evolve, which may result in uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of chinese laws, rules and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. china experiences high turnover of direct labor in the manufacturing sector due to the intensely competitive and fluid market for labor, and the retention of adequate labor is a challenge. if our labor turnover rates are higher than we expect, or we otherwise fail to adequately manage our labor needs, then our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. we are also subject to risks associated with our subsidiaries organized in china. for example, regulatory and registration requirements and government approvals affect the financing that we can provide to our subsidiaries. if we fail to receive required registrations and approvals to fund our subsidiaries organized in china, or if our ability to remit currency out of china is limited, then our business and liquidity could be adversely affected.
these factors may harm our results of operations. also, any measures that we may implement to reduce risks of our international operations may not be effective, may increase our expenses and may require significant management time and effort. entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start-up expenses related to market, personnel and facilities development before any significant revenue is generated. as a result, initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable.
although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to cause compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
we have on occasion not achieved, and may not in the future achieve, expected profitability from our acquisitions.
we have in the past and will continue to seek and complete acquisitions. we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions. similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify future strategic acquisitions and adequately conduct due diligence, consummate these potential acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all, or if consummated, successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions. acquisitions involve significant risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us including:
•   financial risks, such as: (1) overpayment; (2) an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements; (3) exposure to liabilities of the acquired businesses, with contractually-based time and monetary limitations on a seller's obligation to indemnify us; (4) integration costs or failure to achieve synergy targets; (5) incurrence of additional debt; (6) valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets; (7) possible adverse tax and accounting effects; (8) the risk that we acquire manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenue; (9) the risk that, in the future, we may have to close or sell acquired facilities at our cost, which may include substantial employee severance costs and asset write-offs, which have resulted, and may result, in our incurring significant losses; and (10) costs associated with environmental risks including fines, remediation and clean-up.
•   operating risks, such as: (1) the diversion of management's attention and resources to the integration of the acquired businesses and their employees and to the management of expanding operations; (2) the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided; (3) the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources; (4) the need to maintain customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations and restructure or terminate unfavorable relationships; (5) the potential for deficiencies in internal controls of the acquired operations; (6) the inability to attract and retain the employees necessary to support the acquired businesses; (7) potential inexperience in a line of business that is either new to us or that has become materially more significant to us as a result of the transaction; (8) unforeseen difficulties (including any unanticipated liabilities) in the acquired operations; (9) the impact on us of any unionized work force we may acquire or any labor disruptions that might occur; (10) the possibility that the acquired business's past transactions or practices before our acquisition may lead to future commercial or regulatory risks; (11) the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image; (12) the possibility that we will have unutilized capacity due to our acquisition activity; (13) when acquiring an operation from a customer and continuing or entering into a supply arrangement, our inability to meet the expectations of the customer as to volume, product quality, timeliness and cost reductions.
although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of due diligence regarding the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses. until we actually assume operating control of such businesses and their assets and operations, we may not be able to ascertain the actual value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired entities and their operations.
most of our acquisitions involve operations outside of the u.s., which are subject to various risks including those described in "risk factors - we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense than our domestic operations."
we have acquired and may continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations from our customers (or potential customers). in these acquisitions, the divesting company will typically enter into a supply arrangement with the acquirer. therefore, our competitors often also pursue these acquisitions. in addition, certain divesting companies may choose not to offer to sell their operations to us because of our current supply arrangements with other companies or may require terms and conditions that may impact our profitability. if we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities at favorable terms, our growth and profitability could be adversely impacted.
we have expanded the primary scope of our acquisitions strategy beyond focusing on acquisition opportunities presented by companies divesting internal manufacturing operations. as we continue to pursue acquisitions that diversify our business into new industry sectors with new customers and services, the amount and scope of the risks associated may extend beyond those that we have traditionally faced in making acquisitions. these risks include greater uncertainties in the financial benefits and potential liabilities associated with this expanded base of acquisitions.
we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations.
over the past several years, we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings. these initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities, largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand. the process of restructuring entails, among other activities, moving production between facilities, transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies, closing facilities, reducing the level of staff, realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management.
restructurings could adversely affect us, including a decrease in employee morale, delays encountered in finalizing the scope of, and implementing, the restructurings, failure to achieve targeted cost savings, and failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the restructuring process. these risks are further complicated by our extensive international operations, which subject us to different legal and regulatory requirements that govern the extent and speed of our ability to reduce our manufacturing capacity and workforce.
any delay in the implementation of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs.
we are currently in the process of completing the installation of an enterprise resource planning system in certain of our manufacturing facilities, which will replace the existing planning and financial information systems. any delay in the implementation of these information systems could result in material adverse consequences, including disruption of operations, loss of information and unanticipated increases in costs.
disruptions to our information systems, including security breaches, losses of data or outages, and other security issues, could adversely affect our operations.
we rely on information systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to store, process and transmit confidential information, including financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and electronic communications, belonging to our customers, our suppliers, our employees and/or us. we attempt to monitor and mitigate our exposure and modify our systems when warranted and we have implemented certain business continuity items including data backups at alternative sites. nevertheless, these systems are vulnerable to, and at times have suffered from, among other things, damage from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunication services, physical and electronic loss of data, terrorist attacks, security breaches, cyberattacks and computer viruses. we regularly face attempts by others to access our information systems in an unauthorized manner, to introduce malicious software to such systems or both. the increased use of mobile technologies and the internet of things can heighten these and other operational risks. if we, or the third parties who own and operate certain of our information systems, are unable to prevent such breaches, losses of data and outages, our operations could be disrupted. also, the time and funds spent on monitoring and mitigating our exposure and responding to breaches, including the training of employees, the purchase of protective technologies and the hiring of additional employees and consultants to assist in these efforts could adversely affect our financial results. the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks requires us to continually evaluate the threat landscape and new technologies and processes intended to detect and prevent these attacks. there can be no assurance that the security measures and systems configurations we choose to implement will be sufficient to protect the data we manage. any theft or misuse of information resulting from a security breach could result in, among other things, loss of significant and/or sensitive information, litigation by affected parties, financial obligations resulting from such theft or misuse, higher insurance premiums, governmental investigations, negative reactions from current and potential future customers (including potential negative financial ramifications under certain customer contract provisions) and poor publicity and any of these could adversely affect our financial results. in addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulations intended to protect business and personal data in the u.s. and elsewhere. compliance with these regulations can be costly and any failure to comply could result in legal and reputational risks as well as penalties, fines and damages that could adversely affect our financial results.
regulatory risks we are subject to extensive government regulations and industry standards and the terms of complex contracts; a failure to comply with current and future regulations and standards, or the terms of our contractual arrangements, could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
we are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards relating to the products we design and manufacture as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support, privacy and data protection, the regulations that apply to government contracts, and many other facets of our operations. the regulatory climate in the u.s. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods. failure or noncompliance with such regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations. in addition, we regularly enter into a large number of complex contractual arrangements as well as operate pursuant to the terms of a significant number of ongoing intricate contractual arrangements. our failure or our customers' failure to comply with the terms of such arrangements could expose us to claims or other demands and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations.
if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, demand for our services may decline, our reputation may be damaged and we may be subject to liability claims.
our customers' products and the manufacturing processes and design services that we use to produce them often are highly complex. defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. if these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation may also be damaged. the failure of the products that we manufacture or of our manufacturing processes or facilities may subject us to regulatory enforcement, fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down, temporarily halt operations or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility. in addition, these defects may result in liability claims against us, expose us to liability to pay for the recall or remanufacture of a product or adversely affect product sales or our reputation. even if our customers are responsible for the defects or defective specifications, they may not, or may not have resources to, assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects, which could expose us to additional liability claims. any of these actions could increase our expenses, reduce our revenue or damage our reputation as a supplier to these customers.
we may face heightened liability risks specific to our medical device business as a result of additional healthcare regulatory related compliance requirements and the potential severe consequences (e.g., death or serious injury) that could result from manufacturing defects or malfunctions of the medical devices we manufacture or design.
as a service provider engaged in the business of designing and manufacturing medical devices for our customers, we have compliance requirements in addition to those relating to other industries we serve within our business. we are required to register with the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda's quality system regulation ("qsr"), including current good manufacturing practices (cgmps). this regulation establishes requirements for manufacturers of medical devices to implement design and process manufacturing controls, quality control, labeling, handling and documentation procedures. the fda, through periodic inspections and post-market surveillance, continuously and rigorously monitors compliance with these qsr requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements. if any fda inspection reveals noncompliance, and we do not address the fda's concerns to its satisfaction, the fda may elect to take enforcement action against us, including issuing inspection observations or a notice of violation or a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured, issuing an import detention on products entering the u.s. from an offshore facility or temporarily halting operations at or shutting down a manufacturing facility.
beyond the fda, our medical device business is also subject to applicable state and foreign regulatory requirements. within the european union ("eu"), we are required to fulfill certain internationally recognized standards and must undergo periodic inspections to obtain and maintain certifications to these standards. continued noncompliance to the eu regulations could stop the flow of products into the eu from us or from our customers. in china, the safe food and drug administration controls and regulates the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products. we must comply with the regulatory laws applicable to medical device manufactures or our ability to manufacture products in china could be impacted. in japan, the pharmaceutical affairs laws regulate the manufacture and commerce of healthcare products. these regulations also require that subcontractors manufacturing products intended for sale in japan register with authorities and submit to regulatory audits. other foreign countries where we operate have similar laws regarding the regulation of medical device manufacturing. in the event of any noncompliance with these requirements, interruption of our operations and/or ability to allow commerce in these markets could occur, which in turn could cause our reputation and business to suffer.
compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws or regulations could cause us significant expense.
we are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws and regulations, including those arising from global pandemics or relating to the use, generation, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process, those governing worker health and safety, those requiring design changes, supply chain investigation or conformity assessments and those relating to the recycling or reuse of products we manufacture. if we fail to comply with any present or future regulations or timely obtain any needed permits, we could become subject to liabilities, and we could face fines or penalties, the suspension of production, or prohibitions on sales of products we manufacture. in addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product or with changes in our operational, procurement and inventory management activities.
certain environmental laws impose liability for the costs of investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on an owner, occupier or operator of real estate, or on parties who arranged for hazardous substance treatment or disposal, even if such person or company was unaware of, or not responsible for, contamination at the affected site. soil and groundwater contamination may have occurred at or near, or may have arisen from, some of our facilities. from time to time we investigate, remediate and monitor soil and groundwater contamination at certain of our operating sites. in certain instances where contamination existed prior to our ownership or occupation of a site, landlords or former owners have retained some contractual responsibility for contamination and remediation. however, failure of such persons to perform those obligations could result in us being required to address such contamination. as a result, we may incur clean-up costs in such potential removal or remediation efforts. in other instances, we may be responsible for clean-up costs and other liabilities, including the possibility of claims due to health risks by both employees and non-employees, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites.
in addition, there is an increasing governmental focus around the world on global warming and environmental impact issues, which may result in new environmental, health and safety regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. this could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.
we have limited insurance coverage for potential environmental liabilities associated with current operations and we do not anticipate increasing such coverage in the future.
our manufacturing, production and design processes and services may result in exposure to intellectual property infringement and other claims.
providing manufacturing services can expose us to potential claims that products, designs or manufacturing processes we use infringe third party intellectual property rights. even though many of our manufacturing services contracts require our customers to indemnify us for infringement claims relating to their products, including associated product specifications and designs, a particular customer may not, or may not have the resources to, assume responsibility for such claims. in addition, we may be responsible for claims that our manufacturing processes or components used in manufacturing infringe third party intellectual property rights. providing turnkey design solutions, and design and other services can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face providing just manufacturing services, including an increase in exposure to potential claims that products we design or supply, or materials or components we use, infringe third party intellectual property rights. infringement claims could subject us to significant liability for damages, potential injunctive action, or hamper our normal operations such as by interfering with the availability of components. regardless of the merits of any such claim, it could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in the event of such a claim, we may spend significant amounts of money and effort to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain and maintain licenses. we may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining and maintaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all. our customers may be required to or decide to discontinue products that are alleged to be infringing, and such discontinuance may result in a significant decrease in our business and/or could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. these risks may be heightened in connection with our customer relationships with emerging companies.
components we purchase, products we design and/or manufacture and/or services we provide may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, some of whom may hold key intellectual property rights in areas in which we operate. our customers or suppliers could also become subject to infringement claims. patent clearance or licensing activities, if any, may be inadequate to anticipate and avoid third party claims. additionally, customers for our services in which we have significant technology contributions, typically require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement. if any claims are brought against our customers, our suppliers or us for such infringement, regardless of their merits, we could be required to expend significant resources in the defense or settlement of such claims, or in the defense or settlement of related indemnification claims. in the event of a claim, we may be required to spend significant amounts of money and effort to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain and maintain licenses. we may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining or maintaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all. we, our suppliers or our customers may be required to or decide to discontinue products, and such discontinuance may result in a significant decrease in our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
the success of certain aspects of our business depends in part on our ability to obtain, protect and leverage intellectual property rights.
in certain circumstances, we strive to obtain and protect certain intellectual property rights related to solutions, designs, processes and products that we create. we believe that obtaining a significant level of protected proprietary technology may give us a competitive advantage. in addition to selectively relying on patent rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including non-disclosure agreements with our customers, employees and suppliers and our internal security systems, policies and procedures to protect our know-how and trade secrets. however, we cannot be certain the measures we employ will result in protected intellectual property rights or will result in the prevention of unauthorized use of our technology. if we are unable to obtain and protect intellectual property rights embodied within our solutions, designs, processes and products, this could reduce or eliminate competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
even if we take steps to protect certain intellectual property rights, these mechanisms may not afford complete or sufficient protection, and misappropriation may still occur. further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire or enforce our patent or other rights, if any, and that others will not independently develop similar know-how and trade secrets, or develop better solutions, designs, processes and products than us. we have not historically sought patent protection for many of our proprietary processes, designs or other patentable intellectual property. further, we may not be able to prevent current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching non-disclosure agreements and misappropriating proprietary information. if any of the foregoing occur, it could impair our ability to compete with others in our industry, result in a significant decrease in our business and/or could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
financial risks exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect our financial results.
we provide manufacturing services to companies and industries that have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial difficulty. if our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our products from these customers could decline. additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty sourcing supplies necessary to fulfill production requirements. if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, a charge for inventory writeoffs, an impairment of contract assets, a reduction in revenue, and an increase in our working capital requirements due to higher inventory levels and increases in days our accounts receivable are outstanding. in addition, because we securitize certain of our accounts receivable, our securitization programs could be negatively affected by customer financial difficulty affecting the recovery of a significant amount of receivables.
when financial markets experience significant turmoil, the financial arrangements we may need to enter into, refinance or repay and our customers may be adversely affected.
credit market turmoil could negatively impact the counterparties and lenders to our forward foreign exchange contracts, trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs, unsecured credit and term loan facilities, commercial paper program, various foreign subsidiary credit facilities and other debt facilities. these potential negative impacts could limit our ability to borrow under these financing agreements, contracts, facilities and programs or renew or obtain future additional financing. credit market turmoil could also negatively impact certain of our customers and certain of their respective customers, which could cause them to reduce or cancel their orders and have a negative effect on our results of operations.
we can offer no assurance under the uncommitted trade accounts receivable sales programs that if we attempt to sell receivables through such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks, which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities.
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes.
we base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law (including adverse changes to the manner in which the u.s. and other countries tax multinational companies or interpret their tax laws). we cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes. in addition, our effective tax rate may be increased by changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our cash management strategies, changes in local tax rates or countries adopting more aggressive interpretations of tax laws, or other legislative changes, including the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("tax act").
several countries in which we are located allow for tax incentives to attract and retain business. we have obtained incentives where available and practicable. our taxes could increase if certain tax incentives are retracted, which could occur if we are unable to satisfy the conditions on which such incentives are based, if they are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions otherwise increase. due to the possibility of changes in existing tax law and our operations, we are unable to predict how any expirations will impact us in the future. in addition, acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase, depending on the jurisdictions in which the acquired operations are located.
certain of our subsidiaries provide financing, products and services to, and may undertake certain significant transactions with, other subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. several jurisdictions in which we operate have tax laws with detailed transfer pricing rules that require that all transactions with non-resident related parties be priced using arm's length pricing principles, and that contemporaneous documentation must exist to support such pricing. there is a risk that the taxing authorities may not deem our transfer pricing documentation acceptable. in addition, the organization for economic cooperation and development continues to issue guidelines and proposals related to base erosion and profit shifting which may result in legislative changes that could reshape international tax rules in numerous countries and negatively impact our effective tax rate.
our credit rating may be downgraded.
our credit is and certain of our financial instruments and our commercial paper are rated by credit rating agencies. any potential future negative change in our credit ratings may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all; negatively impact the price of our common stock; increase our interest payments under existing debt agreements; cause us to lose the ability to utilize our commercial paper program; and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, the interest rate payable under the credit facility (as such terms are defined in note 7 - "notes payable and long-term debt" to the consolidated financial statements) is subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit ratings change. thus, any potential future negative change in our credit rating may increase the interest rate payable on the credit facility and certain of our other borrowings.
our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future.
the company has a number of debt facilities. refer to "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources" and note 7 - "notes payable and long-term debt" to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities, undertake significant additional expansion activities, or make substantial investments in our infrastructure or in support of customer opportunities, our capital needs would increase and could result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. there can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. an increase in the level of our indebtedness, among other things, could:
•   make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for other acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business;
•   make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and
•   impact certain financial covenants that we are subject to in connection with our debt and asset-backed securitization programs.
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet future debt service obligations.
an adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition.
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and certain other long term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. an adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. if certain economic or fiscal issues occur, interest rates could rise, which would increase our interest costs and reduce our net income. also, increased interest rates could make any future fixed interest rate debt obligations more expensive.
in addition, the u. k.'s financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021. the alternative reference rates for u.s. dollar libor and other currencies have been announced. at this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to libor or the discontinuation of libor. if libor is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor, we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations.
although a significant number of our operations are located outside the united states, the majority of our business is conducted in u.s. dollars. changes in exchange rates will affect our net revenue, cost of sales, operating margins and net income. we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations. we use financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. we believe that our hedging activities enable us to largely protect ourselves from future exchange rate fluctuations. if, however, these hedging activities are not successful, if the counterparties to these hedging activities default on their obligations to us or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates. in addition, certain countries in which we operate have adopted, or may adopt, currency controls requiring that local transactions be settled only in local currency. such controls could require us to hedge larger amounts of local currency than we have in the past.
energy price increases may negatively impact our results of operations.
certain of the components that we use in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. in addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our facilities and transportation activities. an increase in energy prices, which have been volatile historically, could cause an increase in our raw material costs and transportation costs. in addition, increased transportation costs of certain of our suppliers and customers could be passed along to us. we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs. in addition, any increase in our product prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability.
an impairment in the value of our assets would reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.
we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. we perform a goodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. a decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of our businesses and we could be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact our consolidated balance sheet, as well as our consolidated statement of operations.
general risk factors changes in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations.
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board (fasb), the american institute of certified public accountants, the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions that are completed before a change is announced. changes to those rules or questions as to how we interpret or implement them may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business. for example, significant changes to revenue recognition rules have been adopted and first applied to us in fiscal year 2019.
we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, climate change and global events.
our operations and those of our customers and suppliers may be subject to natural disasters, climate change-related events, or other business disruptions, which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses. we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes (including in florida, where our headquarters are located), earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water or other natural resource shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, drought, fire, extreme weather conditions, rising sea level, geopolitical events such as direct or indirect terrorist acts or acts of war, other natural or manmade disasters, boycotts and sanctions or widespread criminal activities. such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or to deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business globally or in certain regions. while we maintain similar manufacturing capacities at different locations and coordinate multi-source supplier programs on many of our materials, which we believe better enables us to respond to these types of events, we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. such coverage may not be adequate, or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms.
while we manufacture our products in a large number of diversified facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our key manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster or otherwise, whether short- or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on us.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. we provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. we derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as "manufacturing services"), which encompass the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications and are then provided to the customer.
we have two reporting segments: electronics manufacturing services ("ems") and diversified manufacturing services ("dms"), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. our ems segment is focused around leveraging it, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large-scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. our ems segment includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, cloud, networking and storage, defense and aerospace, industrial and energy, print and retail, and smart home and appliances industries. our dms segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences, technologies and healthcare. our dms segment includes customers primarily in the connected devices, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.
as of september 1, 2020, certain customers have been realigned within our operating segments. our operating segments, which are the reporting segments, continue to consist of the dms and ems segments. beginning in fiscal year 2021, customers within the automotive and transportation and smart home and appliances industries will be presented within the dms segment.
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspecting and stocking of materials. although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, our ability to purchase components and materials efficiently may contribute significantly to our operating results. while we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers, rising component and material prices may negatively affect our margins. net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product.
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. during periods of low production volume, we generally have reduced operating income margins.
we monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can try to respond appropriately as circumstances change.
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. to support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. most of the expenses associated with these customer-specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. in addition, our engineers engage in research and development ("r&d") of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. the expenses of these r&d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations.
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in u.s. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the u.s. are denominated in local currencies. we economically hedge certain of these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
see note 13 - "concentration of risk and segment data" to the consolidated financial statements.
covid-19
the covid-19 pandemic, which began to impact us in january 2020, has continued to affect our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers into our fiscal fourth quarter. travel and business operation restrictions arising from virus containment efforts of governments around the world have continued to impact our operations in asia, europe and the americas. with the exception of certain jurisdictions, essential activity exceptions from these restrictions have allowed us to continue to operate. nevertheless, virus containment efforts during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020, led to a disruption in operations and certain facility or intermittent business closures in areas such as china, malaysia, india, mexico and california, which resulted in additional direct costs and a reduction in revenue in certain end markets.
our first priority has been the health and safety of our employees and so we have incurred additional costs in order to procure the necessary equipment, including face masks, thermometers, hand sanitizers and personal protection equipment, to keep our employees safe. we have implemented risk-mitigation activities including travel restrictions, social distancing practices, additional cleaning procedures within our facilities, contact tracing, covid-19 testing, restricting the number of visitors to our sites and requiring employees and visitors to have their temperatures taken and wear masks when they are at our sites. during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020, we incurred approximately $141.9 million in direct costs associated with the covid-19 outbreak, primarily due to incremental and idle labor costs leading to a reduction in factory utilization as a result of the travel disruptions and governmental restrictions and the procurement of personal protection equipment for our employees globally. this increase in costs was partially offset by governmental subsidies, such as lower payroll taxes or social insurance in certain countries, related to covid-19 incentives.
additionally, certain of the company's suppliers were similarly impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, leading to supply chain constraints, including difficulty sourcing materials necessary to fulfill customer production requirements and challenges in transporting completed products to our end customers.
we have implemented efforts across the organization to enhance our financial position, increase liquidity and reduce costs. during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020, we added incremental short-term committed revolving credit agreements of $625.0 million. we also issued $600.0 million of 10-year senior notes in july 2020, which was used to: (i) pay $400.0 million of senior notes due in december 2020 and (ii) increase our cash on hand.
in addition, we have taken aggressive steps to reduce expenses, including suspending base salary increases for fiscal year 2021. our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and other executive vice presidents will reduce their base salaries by 25% from june 1, 2020 through november 30, 2020 and will forego any bonus that would otherwise be due to them under jabil's fiscal year 2020 short-term incentive program. members of jabil's board of directors will also reduce by 25% their annual cash retainers that would otherwise be payable during the period from june 1, 2020 through november 30, 2020.
in order to further decrease operating expenses and better align with the needs of the business, we have reduced our worldwide workforce and implemented voluntary early retirement programs. in connection with reducing our worldwide workforce, we incurred $56.6 million of severance and benefit costs during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020. following this reduction in headcount, we expect annual savings beginning in fiscal year 2021 of approximately $40.0 million to $50.0 million. we continue to focus on prioritizing spending related to future business.
we do not expect any material impairments or adjustments to the fair value of our assets as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and determined there was no impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets.
our performance is subject to global economic conditions, as well as their impacts on levels of consumer spending and the production of goods. these current conditions are significantly impacted by covid-19, have had a negative impact on our results of operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 and will continue to have a negative impact on our operations over the next fiscal year and likely beyond.
summary of results the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain key operating results and other financial information (in thousands, except per share data):
fiscal year ended august 31,
2020                                                         2019                      2018

key performance indicators management regularly reviews financial and non-financial performance indicators to assess the company's operating results. changes in our operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by our working capital requirements, which are dependent on the effective management of our sales cycle as well as timing of payments. our sales cycle measures how quickly we can convert our manufacturing services into cash through sales. we believe the metrics set forth below are useful to investors in measuring our liquidity as future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable.
the following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, certain of management's key financial performance indicators:

sales cycle(1)                            19 days             27 days                  25 days                  16 days inventory turns (annualized)(2)           6 turns             6 turns                  6 turns                  6 turns days in accounts receivable(3)            38 days             39 days                  38 days                  38 days days in inventory(4)                      58 days             64 days                  65 days                  60 days days in accounts payable(5)               77 days             76 days                  78 days                  82 days
(1)   the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators.
(2)   inventory turns (annualized) are calculated as 360 days divided by days in inventory.
(3)   days in accounts receivable is calculated as accounts receivable, net, divided by net revenue multiplied by 90 days. during the three months ended may 31, 2020 and november 30, 2019, the increase in days in accounts receivable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable, primarily driven by higher sales and timing of collections. during the three months ended february 29, 2020, the decrease in days in accounts receivable from the prior sequential quarter is primarily driven by lower sales and the timing of collections in the second quarter.
(4)   days in inventory is calculated as inventory and contract assets divided by cost of revenue multiplied by 90 days. during the three months ended august 31, 2020, may 31, 2020 and august 31, 2019, the decrease in days in inventory from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to increased sales activity during the quarter. during the three months ended february 29, 2020, the increase in days in inventory from the prior sequential quarter is primarily driven by idle capacity and supply chain constraints, largely in china due to covid-19. during the three months ended february 28, 2019, days in inventory increased from the prior sequential quarter to support anticipated ramps and expected sales levels in the second half of fiscal year 2019 and due to the acquisition of certain assets of johnson &amp; johnson medical devices companies ("jjmd") facilities at the end of february.
(5)   days in accounts payable is calculated as accounts payable divided by cost of revenue multiplied by 90 days. during the three months ended may 31, 2019, the decrease in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the quarter. during the three months ended february 28, 2019, the decrease in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to lower materials purchases during the quarter and timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the quarter.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to note 1 - "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition for our over time customers, we believe the measure of progress which best depicts the transfer of control is based on costs incurred to date, relative to total estimated cost at completion (i.e., an input method). this method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services because it results in the recognition of revenue on the basis of our to-date efforts in the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total expected efforts in the satisfaction of the performance obligation. we believe that the use of an input method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. the transaction price of each performance obligation is generally based upon the contractual stand-alone selling price of the product or service.
certain contracts with customers include variable consideration, such as periodic cost of materials adjustments, rebates, discounts, or returns. we recognize estimates of this variable consideration that are not expected to result in a significant revenue reversal in the future, primarily based on the most likely level of consideration to be paid to the customer under the specific terms of the underlying programs.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. this allowance is based on management's assessment of specific customer balances after considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary.
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory-related contractual obligations and other lower of cost and net realizable value considerations. if actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary.
long-lived assets we review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset(s) or asset group(s) are expected to generate. if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value. the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions.
we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill.
30
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two-step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. if the qualitative assessment is not performed or if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any.
we perform an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible is impaired. if the qualitative assessment is not performed or if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible exceeds the carrying value, the recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. we determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty method. if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired.
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets are in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. significant judgments inherent in this analysis included assumptions regarding appropriate revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets. the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the "more likely than not" criteria. we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements. our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and/or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. for further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to note 15 - "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements.

results of operations refer to item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" section contained in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 for the results of operations discussion for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2018.
net revenue generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. accordingly, we do not differentiate or separately report revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. in addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure.
the distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including the following: fluctuations in customer demand; efforts to diversify certain portions of our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships.

2020 vs. 2019
net revenue increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019. specifically, the ems segment revenues increased 8% primarily due to (i) a 10% increase in revenues from existing customers within our cloud business and (ii) a 2% increase in revenues from existing customers within our capital equipment business. the increase is partially offset by (i) a 3% decrease from existing customers within our networking and telecommunications business and (ii) a 1% decrease in revenues from existing customers within our print and retail business. dms segment revenues increased 8% due to an 11% increase in revenues from new and existing customers in our healthcare business. the increase is partially offset by a 3% decrease in revenue from customers within our edge devices and accessories businesses.
during fiscal year 2021, we expect lower revenue than fiscal year 2020 as approximately $1.0 billion in components that we procure and integrate for our cloud business will shift from a purchase and resale model to a consignment service model. as a result of this transition, we expect higher gross margins and lower cash used in this business.
the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue:

2020 vs. 2019
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase of $108.8 million in incremental and idle labor costs associated with travel disruptions and governmental restrictions, largely related to the covid-19 outbreak. this increase in costs was partially offset by governmental subsidies, such as lower payroll taxes or social insurance in certain countries, related to covid-19 incentives.
additionally, gross profit as a percent of revenue decreased for the ems segment largely due to product mix. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the dms segment due to improved profitability across the various businesses.

2020 vs. 2019
selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019. the increase is predominantly due to (i) $33.1 million in costs related to the covid-19 outbreak, including personal protection equipment for our employees globally, (ii) a $41.6 million increase in salary and salary related expenses and other costs primarily due to our strategic collaboration with a healthcare company and (iii) a $21.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to a higher stock price for awards granted during fiscal year 2020. the increase is partially offset by (i) a $20.5 million decrease in acquisition and integration charges related to our strategic collaboration with a healthcare company and (ii) a $12.5 million decrease due to lower salary and salary related expense across the company and lower travel expenses related to the pandemic.

(dollars in millions)                 2020   2019                2018                     2020 vs. 2019      2019 vs. 2018
amortization of intangibles     $55.5               $31.9               $38.5              $23.6             $(6.6         )
2020 vs. 2019
amortization of intangibles increased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 primarily driven by amortization related to the nypro trade name, which was reclassified to a definite-lived intangible asset during fiscal year 2019 as a result of our decision that the indefinite-lived trade name of $72.5 million acquired during the acquisition of nypro would be phased out by 2023. as such, this trade name was assigned a four-year estimated useful life and is being amortized on an accelerated basis.
restructuring, severance and related charges following is a summary of our restructuring, severance and related charges:

total restructuring, severance and related charges(1)          $156.6               $25.9               $36.9
(1)   includes $61.9 million, $21.5 million and $16.3 million recorded in the ems segment, $75.6 million, $2.6 million and $16.6 million recorded in the dms segment and $19.1 million, $1.8 million and $4.0 million of non-allocated charges for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. except for asset write-off costs, all restructuring, severance and related charges are cash settled.
(2)   as the company continues to optimize its cost structure and improve operational efficiencies, $56.6 million of employee severance and benefit costs was incurred in connection with a reduction in the worldwide workforce during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020. the remaining amount primarily relates to the 2020 restructuring plan.
(3)   primarily relates to the 2017 restructuring plan, which was complete as of august 31, 2019.
2020 restructuring plan on september 20, 2019, our board of directors formally approved a restructuring plan to realign our global capacity support infrastructure, particularly in our mobility footprint in china, in order to optimize organizational effectiveness. this action includes headcount reductions and capacity realignment (the "2020 restructuring plan"). the 2020 restructuring plan reflects our intention only and restructuring decisions, and the timing of such decisions, at certain locations are still subject to consultation with our employees and their representatives.
upon completion of the 2020 restructuring plan, the company expects to recognize approximately $85.0 million in restructuring and other related costs. the company incurred $76.9 million of costs during fiscal year 2020 and anticipates incurring the remaining costs during fiscal year 2021 for employee severance and benefit costs, asset write-off costs, and other related costs.
the 2020 restructuring plan, once complete, is expected to yield annualized cost savings beginning in fiscal year 2021 of approximately $40.0 million. during fiscal year 2020, we realized cost savings of approximately $25.0 million.

2020 vs. 2019
the increase in loss on securities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, is due to: (i) an impairment charge of $36.4 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020, related to our investment in the senior non-convertible preferred stock of iqor holdings, inc. ("iqor") as a result of iqor's bankruptcy filing; (ii) an impairment charge of $12.2 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020, in connection with the sale of an investment in the optical networking segment; partially offset by (iii) a $29.6 million due to the restructuring of securities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019 due to the exchange of preferred stock of iqor in association with iqor's previously announced sale of its international logistics and product service assets.

2020 vs. 2019
other expense decreased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, primarily due to: (i) an $18.2 million decrease in fees associated with the utilization of trade accounts receivable sales programs during fiscal year 2020 and fees incurred for the amended and new asset-backed securitization programs in fiscal year 2019 and (ii) a $14.6 million decrease driven primarily by the expected return on plan assets and actuarial gain related to the company's pension plans. the decrease was partially offset by $7.3 million of costs incurred during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 as a result of the early redemption of the 5.250% senior notes due 2020.

interest income decreased during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, due to lower interest rates, partially offset by increased interest income on cash equivalents (investments that are readily convertible to cash with maturity dates of 90 days or less).

2020 vs. 2019
the effective income tax rate increased for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020, compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, primarily due to: (i) lower income before income tax for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020, driven in part by increased restructuring charges with minimal related tax benefit; (ii) a $21.2 million income tax expense associated with the re-measurement of deferred tax assets related to the extension of a non-u.s. tax incentive recorded during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020; and (iii) a $19.1 million income tax benefit related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tax act") adjustments for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019.
non-gaap (core) financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. the non-gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. non-gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. also, our "core" financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our "core" financial measures.
management believes that the non-gaap "core" financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring, severance and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition and integration charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, loss on securities, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. among other uses, management uses non-gaap "core" financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation.
we determine the tax effect of the items excluded from "core" earnings and "core" diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. in certain jurisdictions where we do not expect to realize a tax benefit (due to existing tax incentives or a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a reduced or 0% tax rate is applied.
we are reporting "core" operating income, "core" earnings and cash flows to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our "core" manufacturing operations. a significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating "core" operating income and "core" earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. in the case of restructuring, severance and related charges, we may make associated cash payments in the future. in addition, although, for purposes of calculating "core" operating income and "core" earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders' ownership interest. we encourage you to consider these matters when evaluating the utility of these non-gaap financial measures.
adjusted free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash receipts on sold receivables less net capital expenditures (acquisition of property, plant and equipment less proceeds and advances from the sale of property, plant and equipment). we report adjusted free cash flow as we believe this non-gaap financial measure is useful to investors in measuring our ability to generate cash internally and fund future growth and to provide a return to shareholders.
included in the tables below are a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measures as provided in our consolidated financial statements:

acquisitions and expansion during fiscal year 2018, the company and jjmd entered into a framework agreement to form a strategic collaboration and expand our existing relationship. the strategic collaboration expands our medical device manufacturing portfolio, diversification and capabilities.
on february 25, 2019 and april 29, 2019, under the terms of the framework agreement, we completed the initial and second closings, respectively, of our acquisition of certain assets of jjmd. the aggregate purchase price paid for both the initial and second closings was approximately $167.4 million in cash. for the initial and second closings, total assets acquired of $173.5 million and total liabilities assumed of $6.1 million were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates.
on september 30, 2019, under the terms of the framework agreement, the company completed the third closing of its acquisition of certain assets of jjmd. the aggregate purchase price paid for the third closing was approximately $113.1 million in cash. for the third closing, total assets acquired of $196.2 million, including $80.7 million in contract assets, $34.0 million in inventory and $56.0 million in goodwill, and total liabilities assumed of $83.1 million, including $73.5 million of pension obligations, were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. there were no intangible assets identified in this acquisition and the goodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce. the majority of the goodwill is currently not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
the acquisitions of the jjmd assets have been accounted for as separate business combinations for each closing using the acquisition method of accounting. the results of operations were included in the company's consolidated financial results beginning on february 25, 2019 for the initial closing, april 29, 2019 for the second closing and september 30, 2019 for the third closing. the company believes it is impracticable to provide pro forma information for the acquisitions of the jjmd assets.
refer to note 16 - "business acquisitions" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, additional proceeds available under our asset-backed securitization programs and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash on hand, funds provided by operations and the access to the capital markets, will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, any share repurchases under the approved program, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months. we continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash.
certain of our trade accounts receivable sale programs expire or are subject to termination provisions within the 2020 calendar year. while we expect to renew such trade accounts receivable sale programs, market conditions, including the implications of the covid-19 pandemic, at the time our current programs expire may create challenges in doing so, such as incurring a higher cost of capital.
cash and cash equivalents as of august 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries. most of our cash and cash equivalents as of august 31, 2020 could be repatriated to the united states without potential tax expense.

(1)   on january 15, 2020, we issued $500.0 million of publicly registered 3.600% senior notes due 2030 (the "3.600% senior notes"). the net proceeds from the offering were used for the repayment of term loan indebtedness.
(2)   on july 13, 2020, the company issued $600.0 million of publicly registered 3.000% senior notes due 2031 (the "3.000% senior notes"). the net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including to redeem the $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.625% senior notes due 2020 and pay the applicable "make-whole" premium.
(3)   on january 22, 2020, we entered into a senior unsecured credit agreement which provides for: (i) a revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $2.7 billion, of which $700.0 million expires on january 22, 2023 and $2.0 billion expires on january 22, 2025 and (ii) a $300.0 million term loan facility which expires on january 22, 2025, (collectively the "credit facility"). interest and fees on the credit facility advances are based on our non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by standard &amp; poor's ratings service, moody's investors service and fitch ratings. in connection with our entry into the credit facility, we terminated our amended and restated five-year credit agreement dated november 8, 2017 and the credit agreement dated august 24, 2018.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020, the interest rates on the revolving credit facility ranged from 1.2% to 4.3% and the term loan facility ranged from 1.6% to 2.9%. interest is charged at a rate equal to (a) for the revolving credit facility, either 0.000% to 0.450% above the base rate or 0.975% to 1.450% above the eurocurrency rate and (b) for the term loan facility, either 0.125% to 0.750% above the base rate or 1.125% to 1.750% above the eurocurrency rate. the base rate represents the greatest of: (i) citibank, n.a.'s prime rate, (ii) 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and (iii) 1.0% above one-month libor, but not less than zero. the eurocurrency rate represents adjusted libor or adjusted cdor, as applicable, for the applicable interest period, but not less than zero. fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders and a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit.
additionally, our foreign subsidiaries have various additional credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs.
(4)   on april 24, 2020, we entered into an unsecured 364-day revolving credit agreement up to an initial aggregate amount of $375.0 million, which was increased to $425.0 million on may 29, 2020 (the "364-day revolving credit agreement"). the 364-day revolving credit agreement expires on april 23, 2021. interest and fees on the 364-day
40
revolving credit agreement advances are based on our non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by standard & poor's ratings service, moody's investors service and fitch ratings.
as of august 31, 2020, no draws were made on the 364-day revolving credit agreement. interest is charged at a rate equal to either (i) 0.450%, 0.525% or 0.800% above the base rate or (ii) 1.450%, 1.525% or 1.800% above the eurodollar rate. the base rate represents the greatest of: (i) mizuho's base rate, (ii) 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and (iii) 1.0% above one-month libor, subject to a floor of 0.75%. the eurodollar rate represents adjusted libor for the applicable interest period, subject to a floor of 0.75%. fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders.
(5)   as of august 31, 2020, we had $3.7 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. the revolving credit facility under the credit facility acts as the back-up facility for commercial paper outstanding, if any. we have a borrowing capacity of up to $1.8 billion under our commercial paper program.
in the ordinary course of business, we have letters of credit and surety bonds with banks and insurance companies outstanding of $120.3 million as of august 31, 2020. unused letters of credit were $94.0 million as of august 31, 2020. letters of credit and surety bonds are generally available for draw down in the event we do not perform.
we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources.
our senior notes and our credit facilities contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. a violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the notes payable and credit facilities and potentially causing acceleration of amounts due under these notes payable and credit facilities. as of august 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. refer to note  - "notes payable and long-term debt" to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
asset-backed securitization programs we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under our foreign asset-backed securitization program and our north american asset-backed securitization program to special purpose entities, which in turn sell certain of the receivables under the foreign program to an unaffiliated financial institution and a conduit administered by an unaffiliated financial institution and certain of the receivables under the north american program to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a monthly basis.
the foreign asset-backed securitization program contains a guarantee of payment by the special purpose entity, in an amount approximately equal to the net cash proceeds under the program. no liability has been recorded for obligations under the guarantee as of august 31, 2020.
certain unsold receivables covering the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available under the north american asset-backed securitization program are pledged as collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution as of august 31, 2020.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 was primarily due to increased accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by increased prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts receivable, contract assets and inventories. the increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments and the third closing of the acquisition of jjmd. the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to an increase in value added tax receivables and forward contract assets. the increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by higher sales and the timing of collections. the increase in contract assets is primarily driven by the third closing of the acquisition of jjmd and due to the timing of revenue recognition for over time customers. the increase in inventories is primarily to support expected sales levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 consisted primarily of: (i) capital expenditures principally to support ongoing business in the dms and ems segments, (ii) expenditures for assets acquired in connection with the third closing of the acquisition of certain assets of jjmd and (iii) purchase price adjustments for the first and second closing of certain assets of jjmd, partially offset by (iv) proceeds and advances from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2020 was primarily due to (i) payments for debt agreements, (ii) the repurchase of our common stock, (iii) dividend payments and (iv) treasury stock minimum tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock. net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by (i) borrowings under debt agreements and (ii) net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan.

we currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. however, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our board each quarter following its review of our financial performance and global economic conditions.
in september 2019, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $600.0 million of our common stock as part of a two-year capital allocation framework ("the 2020 share repurchase program"). as of august 31, 2020, 6.0 million shares had been repurchased for $213.9 million and $386.1 million remains available under the 2020 share repurchase program.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of august 31, 2020 are summarized below. as disclosed below, while we have certain non-cancelable purchase order obligations for property, plant and equipment, we generally do not enter into non-cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. non-cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks, at most. purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

risks related to the covid-19 pandemic
•our business may be further adversely affected by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, including those impacting our manufacturing and supply chain operations, research and development efforts, commercial operations and sales force, administrative personnel, third-party service providers, and business partners and customers, as well as the demand for our marketed products.
•we face risks related to the development, manufacturing, and potential commercialization of regen-cov.
commercialization risks
•we are substantially dependent on the success of eylea and dupixent.
•sales of our products are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, including private payors and government programs such as medicare and medicaid, which could change due to various factors such as the recently announced "most-favored-nation" drug price control measures.
•the commercial success of our products is subject to significant competition from products or product candidates that may be superior to, or more cost effective than, our products or product candidates.
•we and our collaborators on which we rely to commercialize some of our marketed products may be unable to continue to successfully commercialize or co-commercialize our products, both in the united states and abroad.
regulatory and development risks
•drug development and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for drug products is costly, time-consuming, and highly uncertain.
•serious complications or side effects in connection with the use or development of our products or product candidates could cause our regulatory approvals to be revoked or limited or lead to delay or discontinuation of development of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products.
•we may be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial use, which would delay or prevent continued development of such candidates and/or receipt of regulatory approval or commercial sale.
•many of our products are intended to be used in combination with drug-delivery devices, which may result in additional regulatory, commercialization, and other risks.
intellectual property and market exclusivity risks
•we may not be able to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and our patents or other means of defending our intellectual property may be insufficient to protect our proprietary rights.
•patents or proprietary rights of others may restrict our development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization efforts and subject us to patent litigation and other proceedings that could find us liable for damages.
•loss or limitation of patent rights, and regulatory pathways for biosimilar competition, could reduce the duration of market exclusivity for our products, including eylea.
manufacturing and supply risks
•we rely on limited internal and contracted manufacturing and supply chain capacity, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and to advance our clinical pipeline. as we increase our production in response to higher product demand or in anticipation of a potential regulatory approval, our current manufacturing capacity will likely not be sufficient, and our dependence on our collaborators and/or contract manufacturers may increase, to produce adequate quantities of drug material for both commercial and clinical purposes.
•expanding our manufacturing capacity and establishing fill/finish capabilities will be costly and we may be unsuccessful in doing so in a timely manner, which could delay or prevent the launch and successful commercialization of our products approved for marketing and could jeopardize our clinical development programs.
•our ability to manufacture products may be impaired if any of our or our collaborators' manufacturing activities, or the activities of other third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain, are found to infringe patents of others.
•if sales of our marketed products do not meet the levels currently expected, or if the launch of any of our product candidates is delayed or unsuccessful, we may face costs related to excess inventory or unused capacity at our manufacturing facilities and at the facilities of third parties or our collaborators.
•third-party service or supply failures, failures at our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, or failures at the facilities of any other party participating in the supply chain, would adversely affect our ability to supply our products.

risks related to the covid-19 pandemic our business may be further adversely affected by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic.
in december 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, sars-cov-2, causing a disease referred to as covid-19, was reported to have surfaced in wuhan, china. it has since spread around the world, including the united states; and, in march 2020, the world health organization declared the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic. this pandemic has adversely affected or has the potential to adversely affect, among other things, the economic and financial markets and labor resources of the countries in which we operate; our manufacturing and supply chain operations, research and development efforts, commercial operations and sales force, administrative personnel, third-party service providers, and business partners and customers; and the demand for our marketed products.
the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in travel and other restrictions to reduce the spread of the disease, including governmental orders across the globe, which, among other things, direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence, direct businesses and governmental agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations, prohibit certain non-essential gatherings, maintain social distancing, and order cessation of non-essential travel. as a result of these developments, we have implemented work-from-home policies for a significant portion of our employees (except those deemed critical, including those working in our laboratories and manufacturing facilities). the effects of shelter-in-place and social distancing orders, government-imposed quarantines, and work-from-home policies may further negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business, and delay our clinical programs and development timelines beyond the delays we have already experienced and disclosed, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. such restrictions and limitations may also further negatively impact our access to regulatory authorities (which are affected, among other things, by applicable travel restrictions and may be delayed in responding to inquiries, reviewing filings, and conducting inspections); our ability to perform regularly scheduled quality checks and maintenance; and our ability to obtain services from third-party specialty vendors and other providers or to access their expertise as fully and timely as needed. the covid-19 pandemic may also result in the loss of some of our key personnel, either temporarily or permanently. in addition, our sales and marketing efforts have been negatively impacted and may be further negatively impacted by postponement or cancellation of face-to-face meetings and restrictions on access by non-essential personnel to hospitals or clinics to the extent such measures slow down adoption or further commercialization of our marketed products. the demand for our marketed products may also be adversely impacted by the restrictions and limitations adopted in response to the covid-19 pandemic, particularly to the extent they affect the patients' ability or willingness to start or continue treatment with our marketed products. any of the foregoing factors may result in lower net product sales of our marketed products. for example, net product sales of eylea in the united states decreased for the three months ended june 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, due in part to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. see part ii, item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations" for a discussion of our net product sales. demand for some or all of our marketed products may continue to be reduced while the shelter-in-place or social distancing orders are in effect and, as a result, some of our inventory may become obsolete and may need to be written off, impacting our operating results. these and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations may materially adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
quarantines, shelter-in-place, social distancing, and similar government orders (or the perception that such orders, shutdowns, or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur) related to covid-19 or other infectious diseases are impacting personnel at our research and manufacturing facilities, our suppliers, and other third parties on which we rely, and are also impacting the availability or cost of materials produced by or purchased from such parties, resulting in supply chain strains or disruptions that may become material. while some materials and services may be obtained from more than one supplier or provider, port closures and other restrictions resulting from the covid-19 pandemic (including any government restrictions or limitations, such as those that may be imposed under the defense production act) could materially disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials or services (including fill/finish services) required for the development and manufacturing of our products and product candidates as well as our research efforts. if microbial, viral (including covid-19), or other contaminations are discovered in our products, product candidates, the materials used for their production, or in our facilities, or in the facilities of our collaborators, third-party contract manufacturers, or other providers or suppliers, the affected facilities may need to be closed or may otherwise be affected for an extended period of time, or the contamination may result in other delays or disruptions in our direct or indirect supply chain.
in addition, infections and deaths related to covid-19 have disrupted and may continue to disrupt the united states' healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems. such disruptions could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay, fda review and potential approval of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products. it is unknown how long these disruptions could continue. in addition, some of our clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected by the covid-19 pandemic. this impact includes delays in site initiation and patient enrollment due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the covid-19 pandemic, patients' inability to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services, and restrictions on trial initiations imposed by hospitals and other trial sites as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. similarly, our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to covid-19, has been and may continue to be delayed or disrupted. for example, as noted above in part i, item 1. "business - programs in clinical development," the ongoing covid-19 pandemic continues to impact clinical trial execution in many regions across the world for us and our collaborators. we will continue to evaluate the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic on an individual trial basis. the disruptions caused by the covid-19 pandemic may further negatively impact the progress of our clinical trials, including the readouts of trial results, the timing of regulatory review, and any anticipated program milestones. further, while we continue to focus on developing regen-cov to address the covid-19 pandemic, our research programs and the development of our other product candidates may need to be further de-prioritized. any elongation or de-prioritization of our research and development programs and clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of our product candidates, which would increase our operating expenses and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the covid-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it recently caused significant disruption of global financial markets and could cause more economic disruption in the future. this disruption, if sustained or recurrent, could make it more difficult for us to access capital if needed. in addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of covid-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.
the global covid-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. the ultimate impact of this pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems, or the global economy as a whole. these effects could have a material impact on our operations.
to the extent the covid-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, prospects, operating results, or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this "risk factors" section.
we face risks related to the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of regen-cov.
in response to the recent global outbreak of covid-19, we are pursuing the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of regen-cov, a novel investigational antibody cocktail treatment designed to prevent and treat infection from the sars-cov-2 virus that received an eua from the fda in november 2020. there can be no assurance with respect to how long the eua will remain in effect and whether the eua is revoked by the fda based on its determination that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization or other reasons. in addition, while the eua was granted following our announcement of positive results from the ongoing phase 2/3 seamless trial in non-hospitalized patients with covid-19, there are multiple ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the antibody cocktail and there is no assurance of favorable results from any ongoing or future clinical trials or the timing of their completion. it is possible that the fda and other regulatory authorities may not grant the antibody cocktail full marketing approval for the treatment of covid-19, or that any marketing approvals, if granted, may have significant limitations on its use. further, other parties may be successful in developing a more effective treatment for covid-19; and utilization of regen-cov may also be adversely impacted by other factors, such as the rollout of vaccines providing acquired immunity against covid-19. as a result, we may never be successful in fully commercializing regen-cov. the intense public interest, including speculation by the media, in the development and commercialization of regen-cov has caused significant volatility in our stock price, which we expect to continue as data and other information from the ongoing and any future clinical trials evaluating regen-cov and third-party product candidates for the treatment or prevention of covid-19 as well as any other regulatory actions become public.
we also face risks related to our significant investment in the development, supply, allocation, distribution, pricing, and commercialization of regen-cov. given the severity and urgency of the covid-19 pandemic, we have committed significant capital and resources to fund and supply clinical trials and to accelerate and scale up the production of regen-cov, which involves a complex manufacturing process that is both resource- and time-sensitive. we expect our investment in the development and manufacture of regen-cov to continue through 2021 and potentially beyond, although the magnitude of our investment will be subject to clinical data results, the duration of the covid-19 pandemic, and other factors, including regulatory outcomes. if we are unable to maintain the eua or obtain regulatory approvals, or if we make a strategic decision to discontinue development of regen-cov or are otherwise not successful in the commercialization of regen-cov, we will be unable to recoup our significant expenses incurred to date and in the future related to the development and production of regen-cov.
in addition, our internal manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient to cover the demand for regen-cov. while we have entered into a collaboration agreement with roche to develop, manufacture, and distribute regen-cov, we cannot be certain that the technology transfer process required to allow roche to manufacture regen-cov will be completed in the expected time frame or at all nor can we be certain that this collaboration will result in the anticipated increase in the current manufacturing and distribution capacity for regen-cov or that any increased manufacturing and distribution capacity will be sufficient. in addition, we rely entirely on third parties for filling and finishing services for regen-cov. our third-party fill/finish providers may not have sufficient capacity or may otherwise not be able to provide such services on a timely basis in the quantities requested (such as because they devote their capacity to other drugs or vaccines against covid-19), which we have recently experienced. the ability of our third-party providers to deliver such services to us may further be adversely impacted by the imposition of government restrictions or limitations (including those that may be imposed under the defense production act). if we are unable to timely enter into alternative arrangements, or if such alternative arrangements are not available on satisfactory terms or at all, we may experience delays in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of regen-cov, which could, among other things, prevent us from meeting our supply targets under our agreements with the u.s. government.
we and roche also face challenges related to the allocation of existing and future supply of regen-cov, particularly with respect to geographic distribution. as supplies of regen-cov are expected to remain constrained, it is possible that the u.s. government may limit or restrict our ability to distribute and commercialize regen-cov outside of the united states. in addition, as a result of the emergency situations in many countries, there is a heightened risk that regen-cov may be subject to adverse governmental actions in certain countries. the u.s. government may exercise or assert certain rights with respect to our inventions, products, or product candidates. for example, under the defense production act, the u.s. government may, among other things, require domestic industries to provide essential goods and services needed for the national defense, such as drug material or other supplies needed to treat covid-19 patients, which could require us to allocate manufacturing capacity in a way that impacts our regular operations. in addition, our agreements with the u.s. government contain provisions granting the u.s. government certain rights relating to products, product candidates, and related inventions (as applicable) covered by those agreements. for example, our july 2020 agreement with the u.s. government to manufacture and deliver regen-cov to the u.s. government gives the u.s. government, among other rights, the right to require us to grant a non-exclusive license to applicable inventions to a third party if such action is deemed necessary to alleviate certain health or safety needs. this right may be triggered if we, for example, do not manufacture or supply sufficient product to address such needs. if the u.s. government exercises or asserts any such rights or imposes these or similar measures with respect to our products, product candidates, or related inventions (including regen-cov), it may adversely impact our business and results of operations. foreign governments (including the government of ireland, where we have manufacturing facilities) may have similar rights or attempt to assert any such rights. further, we have observed and are likely to continue to face significant public attention and scrutiny over the complex decisions made regarding the regen-cov development program, including any allocation, distribution, or pricing decisions with respect to regen-cov. if we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face significant reputational harm, which could negatively affect our stock price.
risks related to commercialization of our marketed products, product candidates, and new indications for our marketed products we are substantially dependent on the success of eylea and dupixent.
eylea net sales represent a substantial portion of our revenues and this concentration of our net sales in a single product makes us substantially dependent on that product. for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, eylea net sales in the united states represented 58% and 71% of our total revenues, respectively. if we were to experience difficulty with the commercialization of eylea in the united states or if bayer were to experience any difficulty with the commercialization of eylea outside the united states (including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic discussed above), or if we and bayer are unable to maintain current marketing approvals of eylea, we may experience a reduction in revenue and may not be able to sustain profitability, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed.
in addition, we have been increasingly dependent on our share of profits from the commercialization of dupixent under our antibody collaboration with sanofi. if we or sanofi were to experience any difficulty with the commercialization of dupixent or if we or sanofi are unable to maintain current marketing approvals of dupixent, we may experience a reduction in revenue and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed.
if we or our collaborators are unable to continue to successfully commercialize our products, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition will be materially harmed.
we expect that the degree of commercial success of our marketed products will continue to depend on many factors, including the following (as applicable):
•the continued impact of sars-cov-2 (the virus that has caused the covid-19 pandemic) on our business and the demand for our marketed products, as well as its continued impact on, among other things, our employees, collaborators, suppliers, and other third parties on which we rely, our ability to continue to manage our supply chain, and the global economy (as further discussed above under "risks related to the covid-19 pandemic - our business may be further adversely affected by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic");
•effectiveness of the commercial strategy in and outside the united states for the marketing of our products, including pricing strategy;
•sufficient coverage of, and reimbursement for, our marketed products by third-party payors, including medicare and medicaid in the united states and other government and private payors in the united states and foreign jurisdictions, as well as u.s. and foreign payor restrictions on eligible patient populations and the reimbursement process (including drug price control measures that have been or may be introduced in the united states by various federal and state authorities);
•our ability and our collaborators' ability to maintain sales of our marketed products in the face of competitive products and to differentiate our marketed products from competitive products, including as applicable product candidates currently in clinical development; and, in the case of eylea, the existing and potential new competition for eylea (discussed further under "the commercial success of our products and product candidates is subject to significant competition - marketed products" below) and the willingness of retinal specialists and patients to start or continue treatment with eylea or to switch from another product to eylea;
•serious complications or side effects in connection with the use of our marketed products, as discussed under "risks related to maintaining approval of our marketed products and the development and obtaining approval of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products - serious complications or side effects in connection with the use of our products and in clinical trials for our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products could cause our regulatory approvals to be revoked or limited or lead to delay or discontinuation of development of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, which could severely harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition" below;
•maintaining and successfully monitoring commercial manufacturing arrangements for our marketed products with third parties who perform fill/finish or other steps in the manufacture of such products to ensure that they meet our standards and those of regulatory authorities, including the fda, which extensively regulate and monitor pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities;
•our ability to meet the demand for commercial supplies of our marketed products;
•the outcome of the pending proceedings relating to eylea, dupixent, and praluent (described further in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report), as well as other risks relating to our marketed products and product candidates associated with intellectual property of other parties and pending or future litigation relating thereto (as discussed under "risks related to intellectual property and market exclusivity" below);
•the outcome of the pending government proceedings and investigations and other matters described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report (including the civil complaint filed against us on june 24, 2020 in the u.s. district court for the district of massachusetts by the u.s. attorney's office for the district of massachusetts);
•the results of post-approval studies, whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and studies of other products that could implicate an entire class of products or are perceived to do so; and
•the effect of existing and new health care laws and regulations currently being considered or implemented in the united states, including price reporting and other disclosure requirements of such laws and regulations and the potential impact of such requirements on physician prescribing practices and payor coverage.
more detailed information about the risks related to the commercialization of our marketed products is provided in the risk factors below.
we and our collaborators are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight with respect to the products we or our collaborators commercialize. if we or our collaborators fail to maintain regulatory compliance for any of such products, the applicable marketing approval may be withdrawn, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
we and our collaborators are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight with respect to the products we or they commercialize for the products' currently approved indications in the united states, eu, and other countries where such products are approved. if we or our collaborators fail to maintain regulatory compliance for such products' currently approved indications (including because the product does not meet the relevant endpoints of any required post-approval studies, or for any of the reasons discussed below under "risks related to maintaining approval of our marketed products and the development and obtaining approval of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products - obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for drug products is costly, time-consuming, and highly uncertain"), the applicable marketing approval may be withdrawn, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. failure to comply may also subject us to sanctions, product recalls, or withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications. see also "risks related to manufacturing and supply - our or our collaborators' failure to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of drug products or product candidates could result in incurring substantial remedial costs, delays in the development or approval of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products and/or in their commercial launch if regulatory approval is obtained, and a reduction in sales" below.
sales of our marketed products are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
sales of our marketed products in the united states are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, including private payor healthcare and insurance programs, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit management companies ("pbms"), and government programs such as medicare and medicaid. sales of our marketed products in other countries are dependent, in large part, on similar reimbursement mechanisms and programs in those countries.
our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected in a material manner if such third-party payors do not adequately defray or reimburse the cost of our marketed products to patients. if these entities do not provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to our marketed products or provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, such products may be too costly for many patients to afford them, and physicians may not prescribe them. many third-party payors cover only selected drugs, or may prefer selected drugs, making drugs that are not covered or preferred by such payors more expensive for patients. third-party payors may also require prior authorization for reimbursement, or require failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug, particularly with respect to higher-priced drugs. as our currently marketed products and product candidates are biologics, bringing them to market may cost more than bringing traditional, small-molecule drugs to market due to the complexity associated with the research, development, production, supply, and regulatory review of such products. given cost sensitivities in many health care systems (which will likely be exacerbated as a result of the covid-19 pandemic), our currently marketed products and product candidates are likely to be subject to continued pricing pressures, which may have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
in addition, in order for private insurance and governmental payors (such as medicare and medicaid in the united states) to reimburse the cost of our marketed products, we must maintain, among other things, our fda registration and our national drug code, formulary approval by pbms, and recognition by insurance companies and cms. there is no certainty that we will be able to obtain or maintain the applicable requirements for reimbursement (including relevant formulary coverage, as discussed further below) of our current and future marketed products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
government and other third-party payors (including pbms) are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting, and attempting to limit, both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs, such as by requiring outcomes-based or other pay-for-performance pricing arrangements. they are also imposing restrictions on eligible patient populations and the reimbursement process, including by means of required prior authorizations and utilization management criteria, such as step therapy (i.e., requiring the use of less costly medications before more costly medications are approved for coverage). some states are also considering legislation that would control the prices and reimbursement of prescription drugs, and state medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any prescription drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. it is likely that federal and state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on additional health care reform measures in the future that will impose additional constraints on prices and reimbursements for our marketed products; this trend may be further accelerated as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
further, there have been several recent u.s. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation and policies designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. at the federal level, some of the prior budget proposals contained drug price control measures that may be included in future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit medicare part d plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under medicare part b (such as eylea); to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under medicaid; and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. additionally, the hhs and cms have been soliciting feedback on some of these measures and may implement others impacting our business under their existing authority. cms has also sought public comment on how best to leverage its authority provided under the competitive acquisition program and introduce competition into medicare part b by allowing cms to bring on vendors to negotiate payment amounts for medicare part b drugs. in addition, since january 1, 2019, cms has allowed medicare advantage ("ma") plans to use step therapy for part b drugs (such as eylea). in addition, in september 2020, the executive order of the president entitled "lowering drug prices by putting america first" (the "mfn executive order") was issued. the mfn executive order provides that it is "the policy of the united states that the medicare program should not pay more for costly part b or part d prescription drugs or biological products than the most-favored-nation price" within the member countries of the organization for economic co-operation and development (the "mfn price"); and directs the secretary of the hhs to implement rulemaking to test a payment model (the "mfn model") pursuant to which medicare would pay no more than the mfn price for certain drugs covered by medicare parts b and d. on november 20, 2020, hhs, acting through cms, issued an interim final rule with comment period to implement the mfn model (the "mfn interim final rule"), which was intended to commence on january 1, 2021. the mfn interim final rule has been challenged in court by various groups and individual companies, including regeneron. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the lawsuit relating to the mfn interim final rule filed by regeneron. while preliminary injunctive relief preventing the mfn interim final rule from becoming effective on january 1, 2021 has been granted and such relief has not been appealed, if the mfn interim final rule is not permanently enjoined or repealed or the mfn model is otherwise implemented, this would have a material adverse impact on the extent of medicare reimbursements for eylea and our results of operations. similarly, president biden and various members of the current u.s. congress have indicated that lowering drug prices continues to be a legislative and political priority, and some have introduced proposals aimed at drug pricing. at the state level, legislatures are becoming increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and price and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. in some cases, these measures are designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from u.s. government programs (including as a result of the proposals, initiatives, and developments described above) could have a material adverse effect on the sales of eylea or our other marketed products. economic pressure on state budgets may also have a similar impact.
in addition, pbms often develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications. the breadth of the products covered by formularies varies considerably from one pbm to another. failure to be included in such formularies or to achieve favorable formulary status may negatively impact the utilization and market share of our marketed products. if our marketed products are not included within an adequate number of formularies, adequate reimbursement levels are not provided, the eligible insured patient population for our products is limited, or a key payor refuses to provide reimbursement for our products in a particular jurisdiction altogether, this could have a material adverse effect on our and our collaborators' ability to commercialize the applicable product.
in certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage, and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control, and we and our collaborators may be unable to obtain coverage, pricing, and/or reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us or necessary for us or our collaborators to successfully commercialize our marketed products in those countries. in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. the requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country, and may take into account the clinical effectiveness, cost, and service impact of existing, new, and emerging drugs and treatments. for example, the eu provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. a member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. our results of operations may suffer if we or our collaborators are unable to market our products in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our marketed products in foreign countries is limited or delayed.
the commercial success of our products and product candidates is subject to significant competition.
marketed products there is substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and chemical companies. many of our competitors have substantially greater research, preclinical and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities, as well as financial, marketing, and human resources, than we do. our smaller competitors may also enhance their competitive position if they acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative arrangements, or merge with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. there is significant actual and potential future competition for each of our marketed products.
eylea faces significant competition in the marketplace. for example, eylea competes in one or more of its approved indications with other vegf inhibitors, including novartis and genentech/roche's lucentis and novartis' beovu. ophthalmologists are also using off-label, third-party repackaged versions of genentech/roche's approved vegf antagonist, bevacizumab, for the treatment of certain of eylea's indications, and we are aware of another company developing an ophthalmic formulation of such product. in dme and rvo, eylea also competes with intravitreal implants of corticosteroids. we are also aware of a number of companies working on the development of product candidates and extended delivery devices for the potential treatment of one or more of eylea's indications, including those that act by blocking vegf and vegf receptors (including therapies designed to extend the treatment interval) and/or other targets (such as ang2). in addition, we are aware of several companies developing biosimilar versions of eylea and other approved anti-vegf treatments. other potentially competitive products in development include products for use in combination with eylea and/or other anti-vegf treatments, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gene therapies, and other eye-drop formulations, devices, and oral therapies. there also is a risk that third parties repackage zaltrap for off-label use and sale for the treatment of diseases of the eye, even though zaltrap has not been manufactured and formulated for use in intravitreal injections. we are aware of claims by third parties, including those based on published clinical data, alleging that zaltrap may be safely administered to the eye.
the market for dupixent's current and potential future indications is also competitive. in atopic dermatitis, there are several topical ointments or agents either approved or in development. there is also a systemic jak inhibitor approved for atopic dermatitis and others are in development. in addition, a number of companies are developing antibodies against il-13, il-13ra1, ox40, il-31r, and/or il-1alpha. in asthma, competitors to dupixent include antibodies against the il-5 ligand or the il-5 receptor or immunoglobulin e; and some of these antibodies are either approved or in development for indications that also compete or may compete in the future with dupixent in crswnp. there are several other potentially competitive products in development that may compete with dupixent in asthma, as well as potential future indications, including antibodies against thymic stromal lymphopoietin ("tslp"), the il-33 ligand, or the il-33 receptor (st2). dupixent also faces competition from orally administered small molecule agents and inhaled products in asthma and potential future indications.
libtayo also faces significant competition. there are several competitors that are marketing and/or developing antibodies against pd-1 and/or pdl-1, including merck's keytruda, bristol-myers squibb's opdivo, roche's tecentriq, and astrazeneca's imfinzi.
there is also significant actual and potential future competition for other products marketed or otherwise commercialized by us and/or our collaborators under our collaboration agreements with them. for example, there are several companies that are marketing and/or developing antibodies or other molecules (such as small interfering rna molecules, or sirnas) against pcsk9 and il-6 and/or il-6r, which currently (or, for product candidates in development, may in the future if approved) compete with praluent and kevzara, respectively.
product candidates our velocimmune® technology, other antibody generation technologies, and late-stage and earlier-stage clinical candidates face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various technologies, including antibody generation technologies and other approaches such as rna interference (rnai) and chimeric antigen receptor t cell (car-t cell) technologies. for example, we are aware of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in the research and development of antibody-based products against targets that are also the targets of our early- and late-stage product candidates. we are also aware of other companies developing or marketing small molecules that may compete with our antibody-based product candidates in various indications, if such product candidates obtain regulatory approval in those indications. if any of these or other competitors announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory agency for a competitive product, such developments may have an adverse effect on our business or future prospects. in addition, the first product to reach the market in a therapeutic area is often at a significant competitive advantage relative to later entrants to the market. accordingly, the relative speed with which we, or our collaborators, can develop our product candidates, complete the clinical trials and approval processes, and, if such product candidates are approved for marketing and sale, supply commercial quantities to the market is expected to continue to be an important competitive factor. due to the uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for a product against any particular target, which may have a material adverse effect on our business or future prospects.
we rely on our collaborations with bayer and sanofi for commercializing some of our marketed products.
while we have established our own sales and marketing organization for eylea in the united states for its currently approved indications, we have no sales, marketing, commercial, or distribution capabilities for eylea outside the united states. under the terms of our license and collaboration agreement with bayer (which is terminable by bayer at any time upon six or twelve months' advance notice, depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination), we rely on bayer (and, in japan, santen pursuant to a co-promotion and distribution agreement with bayer's japanese affiliate, as in effect from time to time) for sales, marketing, and distribution of eylea in countries outside the united states.
in addition, under the terms of our antibody collaboration and our io collaboration, we and sanofi co-commercialize dupixent and libtayo in the united states. as a result, we rely in part on sanofi's sales and marketing organization in the united states for these products. if we and sanofi fail to coordinate our united states sales and marketing efforts effectively, sales of any of such products may be materially affected. sanofi also maintains other important responsibilities relating to dupixent in the united states. for example, sanofi records product sales for dupixent in the united states and leads negotiations with payors relating to this product. we also rely on sanofi for sales, marketing, and distribution of dupixent and libtayo in countries outside the united states. effective april 1, 2020, we and sanofi amended the antibody collaboration to remove praluent from the lca such that, among other things, the lca no longer governs the development, manufacture, or commercialization of praluent. effective as of the same date, we and sanofi entered into the praluent cross license & commercialization agreement whereby we, at our sole cost, are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of praluent in the united states, and sanofi, at its sole cost, is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of praluent outside of the united states; and sanofi pays us a 5% royalty on sanofi's net product sales of praluent outside the united states until march 31, 2032.
if we and our collaborators are unsuccessful in continuing to commercialize the marketed products subject to such collaborations, or if bayer or sanofi terminate their respective collaborations with us, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially impaired. we have limited commercial capabilities outside the united states and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities. therefore, termination of the bayer collaboration agreement, our antibody collaboration, or our io collaboration would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful commercialization of the applicable products, particularly outside the united states. for additional information regarding our collaborations with bayer and sanofi, see "risks related to our reliance on third parties - if our collaboration with bayer for eylea is terminated, or bayer materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and our ability to continue to develop eylea and commercialize eylea outside the united states in the time expected, or at all, would be materially harmed" below and "risks related to our reliance on third parties - if our antibody collaboration or our io collaboration with sanofi is terminated, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain of our products and product candidates in the time expected, or at all, would be materially harmed" below.
sales of our marketed products recorded by us and our collaborators could be reduced by imports from countries where such products may be available at lower prices.
our sales of products we commercialize in the united states and our collaborators' sales of products they commercialize under our collaboration agreements with them in the united states and other countries (which impact our share of any profits or losses from the commercialization of these products under the relevant collaboration agreements and, therefore, our results of operations) may be reduced if the applicable product is imported into those countries from lower priced markets, whether legally or illegally (a practice known as parallel trading or reimportation). parallel traders (who may repackage or otherwise alter the original product or sell it through alternative channels such as mail order or the internet) take advantage of the price differentials between markets arising from factors including sales costs, market conditions (such as intermediate trading stages), tax rates, or national regulation of prices. under our arrangement with bayer, pricing and reimbursement for eylea outside the united states is the responsibility of bayer. similarly, under our antibody collaboration and io collaboration with sanofi, pricing and reimbursement for the products commercialized thereunder outside the united states are the responsibility of sanofi. prices for our marketed products in jurisdictions outside the united states are based on local market economics and competition and are likely to differ from country to country. in the united states, prices for pharmaceuticals are generally higher than in the bordering nations of canada and mexico and sales of our marketed products in the united states may be reduced if the applicable product marketed in those bordering nations is imported into the united states. in addition, there are proposals to legalize the import of pharmaceuticals from outside the united states into the united states. if such proposals were implemented, our future revenues derived from sales of our marketed products could be reduced. parallel-trading practices also are of particular relevance to the eu, where they have been encouraged by the current regulatory framework. these types of imports may exert pressure on the pricing of our marketed products in a particular market or reduce sales recorded by us or our collaborators, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.
we may be unsuccessful in continuing the commercialization of our marketed products or in commercializing our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, if approved, which would materially and adversely affect our business, profitability, and future prospects.
even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial success of any of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products will depend upon, among other things, their acceptance by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors and on our and our collaborators' ability to successfully manufacture, market, and distribute those products in substantial commercial quantities or to establish and manage the required infrastructure to do so, including large-scale information technology systems and a large-scale distribution network. establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications, if they are not successfully commercialized, we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be severely harmed.
the commercial success of our products may also be adversely affected by guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators, payors, and patient communities that result in decreased use of our products. such guidelines or recommendations may be published not only by governmental agencies, but also professional societies, practice management groups, private foundations, and other interested parties.
our product candidates are delivered either by intravenous infusion or by intravitreal or subcutaneous injections, which are generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule delivery and this could adversely affect the commercial success of those products if they receive marketing approval.
we are dependent upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of or significant reduction in sales to these customers would adversely affect our results of operations.
we sell eylea, libtayo, praluent, and arcalyst in the united states to several distributors and specialty pharmacies, as applicable. under this distribution model, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally take physical delivery of product and generally sell the product directly to healthcare providers or other pharmacies (as applicable). for the year ended december 31, 2020, our gross product sales of such products to two customers accounted on a combined basis for 83% of our total gross product revenue. we expect this significant customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. our ability to generate and grow sales of these products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our distributors and specialty pharmacies are able to provide adequate distribution of these products to healthcare providers. although we believe we can find additional distributors, if necessary, our revenue during any period of disruption could suffer and we might incur additional costs. in addition, these customers are responsible for a significant portion of our net trade accounts receivable balances. the loss of any large customer, a significant reduction in sales we make to them, any cancellation of orders they have made with us, or any failure to pay for the products we have shipped to them could adversely affect our results of operations.
if we are unable to establish commercial capabilities outside the united states for products we intend to commercialize or co-commercialize outside the united states, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.
we have limited commercial capabilities outside the united states and do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing, and distribution of marketed products outside the united states. we will need to establish commercial capabilities outside the united states if we decide to co-commercialize a product outside the united states. for example, we recently exercised our option under the antibody collaboration to co-commercialize dupixent in certain jurisdictions outside the united states. in addition, there may be other circumstances in which we need to establish commercial capabilities outside the united states, including because we decide to commercialize a particular product independently; we are unable to find an appropriate collaborator; or our existing collaborator decides not to opt in, decides to opt out, or breaches its obligations to us with respect to a particular product.
in order to commercialize or co-commercialize any products outside the united states, we must build our sales, marketing, distribution, managerial, and other non-technical capabilities in the relevant markets or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, which would likely be expensive and time consuming and could delay product launch or the co-commercialization of a product in one or more markets outside the united states. we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop commercial capabilities outside the united states within an acceptable time frame or at all. these and other difficulties relating to commercializing our products outside the united states may severely harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
risks related to maintaining approval of our marketed products and the development and obtaining approval of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products if we or our collaborators do not maintain regulatory approval for our marketed products, and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, we will not be able to market or sell them, which would materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
we cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval. if we or our collaborators do not maintain regulatory approval for our marketed products, and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications of our marketed products (or are materially delayed in doing so), the value of our company and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.
obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for drug products is costly, time-consuming, and highly uncertain.
in the united states, we (which, for purposes of this risk factor, includes our collaborators, unless otherwise stated or required by the context) must obtain and maintain approval from the fda for each drug we intend to sell. obtaining fda approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process, and approval is highly uncertain. we cannot predict with certainty if or when we might submit for regulatory approval for any of our product candidates currently under development. any approvals we may obtain may not cover all of the clinical indications for which we are seeking approval. also, an approval might contain significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings, precautions, or contra-indications with respect to conditions of use. additionally, the fda may determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("rems") is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and the product can therefore be approved. a rems may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the fda considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. the fda has substantial discretion in the approval process (including with respect to setting specific conditions for submission) and may either refuse to accept an application for substantive review or may form the opinion after review of an application that the application is insufficient to allow approval of a product candidate. if the fda does not accept our application for review or approve our application, it may require that we conduct additional clinical, preclinical, or manufacturing validation studies and submit the data before it will reconsider our application. depending on the extent of these or any other studies that might be required, approval of any applications that we submit may be delayed significantly, or we may be required to expend more resources. it is also possible that any such additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the fda to make our applications approvable. if any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to delay or abandon our applications for approval.
in certain instances (such as when we use a biomarker-based test to identify and enroll specific patients in a clinical trial), regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic to our therapeutic product candidate may be required as a condition to regulatory approval of the therapeutic product candidate. we may need to rely on third parties to provide companion diagnostics for use with our product candidates. such third parties may be unable or unwilling on terms acceptable to us to provide such companion diagnostics or to obtain timely regulatory approval of such companion diagnostics, which could negatively impact regulatory approval of our product candidates or may result in increased development costs or delays.
the fda may also require us to conduct additional clinical trials after granting approval of a product. its ability to do so has been enhanced by the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007, pursuant to which the fda has the explicit authority to require postmarketing studies (also referred to as post-approval or phase 4 studies), labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with fda-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. post-approval studies, whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other data about our marketed products (or data about products similar to our marketed products that implicate an entire class of products or are perceived to do so) may result in changes in product labeling, restrictions on use, product withdrawal or recall, loss of approval, or lower sales of our products. obligations equivalent in scope, but which can vary widely in application, apply in foreign countries.
according to the fda policies under the prescription drug user fee act, the fda system of review times for new drugs includes standard review and priority review. the fda's goal for a standard review is to review the application within a 10-month time frame from the time the application is filed by the fda (filing date), which typically occurs approximately 60 days following submission of the application by the applicant. the fda has stated the goal to act on 90% of standard new molecular entity ("nme") new drug application ("nda") and original bla submissions within 10 months of the filing date. a priority review designation is given to drugs that treat a serious condition and offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, and may also be afforded to a human drug application based on a priority review voucher. the fda has stated the goal to act on 90% of priority nme nda and original bla submissions within six months of the filing date. however, the fda's review goals are subject to change and the duration of the fda's review depends on a number of factors, including the number and types of other applications that are submitted to the fda around the same time period or are pending. even if any of our applications receives a priority review designation, we may not ultimately be able to obtain approval of our application within a time frame consistent with the fda's stated review goals or at all, and such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process. procedures that are equivalent in scope, but which can vary widely in application, apply in foreign countries.
the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities enforce gcps and other regulations and legal requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical research organizations ("cros"), principal investigators, and trial sites. if we or any of the third parties conducting our clinical studies are determined to have failed to fully comply with gcps, the study protocol or applicable regulations, the clinical data generated in those studies may be deemed unreliable. this could result in non-approval of our product candidates by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities such as the ec, or we or the fda or such other regulatory authorities may decide to conduct additional inspections or require additional clinical studies, which would delay our development programs, require us to incur additional costs, and could substantially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
before approving a new drug or biologic product, the fda and such comparable foreign regulatory authorities require that the facilities at which the product will be manufactured or advanced through the supply chain be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cgmp, requirements and regulations governing the manufacture, shipment, and storage of the product. additionally, manufacturers of biological products and their facilities are subject to payment of substantial user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cgmp regulations and adherence to any commitments made in the applicable bla. these cgmp requirements and regulations are not prescriptive instructions on how to manufacture products, but rather a series of principles that must be observed during manufacturing; as a result, their implementation may not be clearly delineated and may present a challenging task. manufacturing product candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is complex, time-consuming, and expensive. to be successful, our products must be manufactured in compliance with regulatory requirements, and at competitive costs. if we or any of our third-party manufacturers, product packagers, labelers, or other parties performing steps in the supply chain are unable to maintain regulatory compliance with cgmp, the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities can impose monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions, including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing approval. for additional information, see "risks related to manufacturing and supply - our or our collaborators' failure to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of drug products or product candidates could result in incurring substantial remedial costs, delays in the development or approval of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products and/or in their commercial launch if regulatory approval is obtained, and a reduction in sales." our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed as a result of noncompliance with the requirements and regulations described in this paragraph.
we are also subject to ongoing requirements imposed by the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping, and reporting of safety and other post-marketing information. the holder of an approved bla or foreign equivalent is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the bla. the holder of an approved bla or foreign equivalent must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. advertising and promotional materials must comply with fda regulations and those of foreign regulatory authorities and may be subject to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. the applicable regulations in countries outside the u.s. grant similar powers to the competent authorities and impose similar obligations on companies.
in addition to the standard drug approval process, the fda has the authority to grant an eua to allow unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when, based on the totality of scientific evidence, there is evidence of effectiveness of the medical product, and there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. in november 2020, regen-cov received an eua from the fda for the treatment of mild to moderate covid-19. however, the fda may revoke this eua (or any other eua we may be granted in the future) if it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization; therefore, we cannot predict how long this eua (or any other eua we may be granted in the future) will remain in effect. such revocation could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways, including by having to absorb related manufacturing and overhead costs as well as potential inventory write-offs if regulatory approval is not obtained timely or at all.
in addition to the fda and other regulatory agency regulations in the united states, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing and approval of drugs, and commercial sale and distribution of drugs in foreign countries. the foreign regulatory approval process is similarly a lengthy and expensive process, the result of which is highly uncertain, and foreign regulatory requirements include all of the risks associated with fda approval as well as country specific regulations. we and our collaborators must maintain regulatory compliance for the products we or they commercialize in foreign jurisdictions. from time to time, we may hold a product's marketing approval in a jurisdiction outside the united states where we may have less experience and where our regulatory capabilities may be more limited. in addition, actions by a regulatory agency in a country or region with respect to a product candidate may have an impact on the approval process for that product candidate in another country or region. foreign regulatory authorities often also have the authority to require post-approval studies, such as a pass and/or paes, which involve various risks similar to those described above, and may ask for additional data in order to begin a clinical study including phase 3 clinical trials required to submit a maa in the eu. whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product in the united states, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries before we can market that product or any other product in those countries.
furthermore, in the eea, if we do not manage to retain a qppv, to maintain a psmf, or to comply with other pharmacovigilance obligations, we may be at risk of our clinical trials being closed prematurely, our marketing authorization being suspended, and we may be subject to other enforcement actions by the national competent authorities of the eea or the ec.
the exact requirements concerning pharmacovigilance reporting may differ in the numerous countries in which we conduct clinical trials. failure to comply with the related pharmacovigilance requirements may result in the premature closure of the clinical trials and other enforcement actions by the relevant regulatory authorities.
preclinical and clinical studies required for our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is highly uncertain. if any such studies are delayed or yield unfavorable results, regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications of our marketed products may be delayed or become unobtainable.
as described above, we must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell them. we need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and human clinical trials. conducting such studies is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process. these tests and trials may not achieve favorable results for many reasons, including, among others, failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy, the development of serious or life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate (or prior or concurrent exposure to other products or product candidates), difficulty in enrolling and maintaining subjects in a clinical trial, clinical trial design that may not make it possible to enroll or retain a sufficient number of patients to achieve a statistically significant result or the desired level of statistical significance for the endpoint in question, lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate or comparator drug, and the failure of clinical investigators, trial monitors, contractors, consultants, or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan, protocol, or applicable regulations related to the fda's glps or gcps. a clinical trial may also fail because the dose(s) of the investigational drug included in the trial were either too low or too high to determine the optimal effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting.
we will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test favorably and either conduct new studies, which are expensive and time consuming, or abandon that drug development program. if preclinical testing yields unfavorable results, product candidates may not advance to clinical trials. the failure of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our clinical candidates for the desired indication(s) would preclude the successful development of those candidates for such indication(s), in which event our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.
furthermore, some of our products and product candidates (such as libtayo and dupixent) are studied in combination with agents and treatments developed by us or our collaborators. there may be additional risks and unforeseen safety issues resulting from such combined administration, any of which may materially adversely impact clinical development of these product candidates and our ability to obtain regulatory approval.
in some jurisdictions such as the eu, initiating phase 3 clinical trials and clinical trials in the pediatric population is subject to a requirement to obtain approval or a waiver from the competent authorities of the eu member states and/or the ema. if we do not obtain such approval, our ability to conduct clinical trials and obtain marketing authorizations or approvals may be severely impaired and our business may be adversely impacted.
successful development of our current and future product candidates is uncertain.
only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. clinical trials may not demonstrate statistically sufficient effectiveness and safety to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for these product candidates in these indications. many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including our company, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising results have been obtained in earlier trials. in a number of instances, we have terminated the development of product candidates due to a lack of or only modest effectiveness, and clinical trials evaluating our product candidates failed to meet the relevant endpoints. for example, in august 2017, we reported that the phase 3 study evaluating suptavumab, an antibody to rsv, did not meet its primary endpoint of preventing medically-attended rsv infections in infants; as a result, we have discontinued further clinical development of this antibody. moreover, even if we obtain positive results from preclinical testing or clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future trials, or the fda and analogous foreign regulatory authorities may deem the results insufficient for an approval.
many of our clinical trials are conducted under the oversight of idmcs. these independent oversight bodies are made up of external experts who review the progress of ongoing clinical trials, including available safety and efficacy data, and make recommendations concerning a trial's continuation, modification, or termination based on interim, unblinded data. any of our ongoing clinical trials may be discontinued or amended in response to recommendations made by responsible idmcs based on their review of such interim trial results. for example, in august 2020, we discontinued actively treating patients with fasinumab (which at such time only involved dosing in an optional second-year extension phase of one trial) following a recommendation from the responsible idmc that the program be terminated based on available evidence to date. the recommended termination or material modification of any of our ongoing late-stage clinical trials by an idmc could negatively impact the future development of our product candidate(s), and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.
we are studying our antibody-based product candidates in a wide variety of indications in clinical trials. many of these trials are exploratory studies designed to evaluate the safety profile of these compounds and to identify what diseases and uses, if any, are best suited for these product candidates. these product candidates may not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and/or safety profile to support continued development for some or all of the indications that are being, or are planned to be, studied, which would diminish our clinical "pipeline" and could negatively affect our future prospects and the value of our company.
serious complications or side effects in connection with the use of our products and in clinical trials for our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products could cause our regulatory approvals to be revoked or limited or lead to delay or discontinuation of development of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, which could severely harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
during the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor. often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these conditions. various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have been reported from time-to-time during clinical trials of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products. it is possible that as we test our drug candidates or new indications in larger, longer, and more extensive clinical programs, or as use of these drugs becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, and discomforts that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by patients. many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large-scale, phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients after approval. if additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products has many side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may be delayed or fail, or, if the product candidate has received regulatory approval, such approval may be revoked, which would severely harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
with respect to eylea, there are many potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade of vegf that may limit our ability to further successfully commercialize eylea. these serious and potentially life-threatening risks, based on clinical and preclinical experience of vegf inhibitors, include bleeding, intestinal perforation, hypertension, proteinuria, congestive heart failure, heart attack, and stroke. other vegf blockers have reported side effects that became evident only after large-scale trials or after marketing approval when large numbers of patients were treated. there are risks inherent in the intravitreal administration of drugs like aflibercept (such as intraocular inflammation ("ioi"), sterile and culture positive endophthalmitis, corneal decomposition, retinal detachment, and retinal tear), which can cause injury to the eye and other complications. the side effects previously reported for eylea include conjunctival hemorrhage, macular degeneration, eye pain, retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous floaters. in addition, commercialization of eylea or our other products may be impacted by actions of third parties on which we rely, such as manufacturers of syringes or other devices used in the administration of our products. for example, in february 2018, we issued a letter to healthcare professionals providing updated guidance relating to reports of ioi following eylea injections. in this letter, we noted that while our review did not identify any association of ioi rates with the eylea drug itself, an association was seen with certain batches of the syringe that were included in specific lots of final packaged eylea kits. these and other complications or issues or side effects could harm further development and/or commercialization of eylea.
dupixent and libtayo are being studied in additional indications, as shown in the table under part i, item 1. "business - programs in clinical development." there is no guarantee that marketing approval of dupixent or libtayo (as applicable) in any of these indications will be successfully obtained. the side effects previously reported for dupixent include hypersensitivity reactions, conjunctivitis and keratitis, injection-site reactions, eye and eyelid inflammation, cold sores, oropharyngeal pain, and eosinophilia; and the side effects previously reported for libtayo include certain immune-mediated adverse reactions, such as pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, and dermatologic reactions, as well as infusion-related reactions, cellulitis, sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, fatigue, rash, and diarrhea. these and other complications or side effects could harm further development and/or commercialization of dupixent and libtayo (as applicable).
there also are risks inherent in subcutaneous injections (which are used for administering most of our antibody-based products and product candidates), such as injection-site reactions (including redness, itching, swelling, pain, and tenderness) and other side effects. these and other complications or side effects could harm further development and/or commercialization of our antibody-based products and product candidates utilizing this method of administration.
our product candidates in development are recombinant proteins that could cause an immune response, resulting in the creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic protein.
in addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates, the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein. the antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect. in some cases, the antibody can cross-react with the patient's own proteins, resulting in an "auto-immune" type disease. whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical experiments, and their detection or appearance is often delayed, so neutralizing antibodies may be detected at a later date, in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been completed.
we may be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial use, which would delay or prevent continued development of such candidates and/or receipt of regulatory approval or commercial sale, which could materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
if we are unable to continue to develop suitable product formulations or manufacturing processes to support large-scale clinical testing of our product candidates, including our antibody-based product candidates, we may be unable to supply necessary materials for our clinical trials, which would delay or prevent the development of our product candidates. similarly, if we are unable, directly or through our collaborators or third parties, to supply sufficient quantities of our products or develop formulations of our product candidates suitable for commercial use, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval for those product candidates.
many of our products are intended to be used and, if approved, our product candidates may be used in combination with drug-delivery devices, which may result in additional regulatory, commercialization, and other risks.
many of our products are used and some of our products and product candidates may be used, if approved, in combination with a drug-delivery device, including a pre-filled syringe, patch pump, auto-injector, or other delivery system. for example, in the united states and the eu, eylea is approved in the 2mg pre-filled syringe. the success of our products and product candidates may depend to a significant extent on the performance of such devices, some of which may be novel or comprised of complex components. given the increased complexity of the review process when approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing application and the additional risks resulting from a product candidate's designation as a combination product discussed below, our product candidates used with such drug-delivery devices may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval or may not be approved at all. the fda review process and criteria for such applications are not well established, which could also lead to delays in the approval process. in addition, some of these drug-delivery devices may be provided by single-source, third-party providers or our collaborators. in any such case, we may be dependent on the sustained cooperation of those third-party providers or collaborators to supply and manufacture the devices; to conduct the studies and prepare related documentation required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies; and to continue to meet the applicable regulatory and other requirements to maintain approval or clearance once it has been received. in addition, other parties may allege that our drug-delivery devices infringe patents or other intellectual property rights. for example, we are currently party to patent infringement and other proceedings relating to the eylea pre-filled syringe, as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. failure to successfully develop or supply the devices, delays in or failure of the studies conducted by us, our collaborators, or third-party providers, or failure of our company, our collaborators, or the third-party providers to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs, delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval, and associated delays in a product or product candidate reaching the market. loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. further, failure to successfully develop or supply and manufacture these devices, or to gain or maintain their approval, could adversely affect sales of the related products.
in the united states, each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the fda for that type of component, whether a drug, biologic, or device. the determination whether a product is a combination product or two separately regulated products is made by the fda on a case-by-case basis. although a single marketing application is generally sufficient for the approval, clearance, or licensure of a combination product, the fda may determine that separate marketing applications are necessary. in addition, submitting separate marketing applications may be necessary to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application. this could significantly increase the resources and time required to bring a particular combination product to market.
risks related to intellectual property and market exclusivity if we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, or our patents or other means of defending our intellectual property are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our business and competitive position will be harmed.
our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology and other information that we protect as trade secrets. we seek to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through confidentiality agreements and other means. if our trade secrets are improperly disclosed, by our current or former employees, our collaborators, or otherwise, it could help our competitors and adversely affect our business. we will be able to protect our proprietary rights only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and other information are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. the patent position of biotechnology companies, including our company, involves complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. our patents may be challenged, invalidated, held to be unenforceable, or circumvented. patent applications filed outside the united states may be challenged by other parties, for example, by filing third-party observations that argue against patentability or an opposition. such opposition proceedings are increasingly common in the eu and are costly to defend. for example, our european patent no. 2,264,163 (which concerns genetically engineered mice capable of producing chimeric antibodies that are part human and part mouse) is the subject of opposition proceedings in the european patent office (the "epo") (currently pending before its boards of appeal). we have pending patent applications in the united states patent and trademark office (the "uspto"), the epo, and the patent offices of other foreign jurisdictions, and it is likely that we will need to defend patents from challenges by others from time to time in the future. certain of our u.s. patents may also be challenged by parties who file a request for post-grant review or inter partes review under the america invents act of 2011 or ex parte reexamination. for example, on february 11, 2020, anonymous parties filed two requests for ex parte reexamination of two of our patents - u.s. patent nos. 10,406,226 (the "'226 patent") and 10,464,992 (the "'992 patent"). the '226 patent concerns methods for manufacturing vegf antagonist fusion proteins, including aflibercept, and the '992 patent concerns formulations and vials containing vegf antagonist fusion proteins, including aflibercept. the uspto has granted both requests to initiate reexamination proceedings. post-grant proceedings are increasingly common in the united states and are costly to defend. our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive advantages against competitors. furthermore, even if the outcome is favorable to us, the enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be extremely expensive and time consuming.
we also currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in the united states and other jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. as our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering, or using trademarks that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be adversely affected.
we may be restricted in our development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization activities by patents or other proprietary rights of others, and could be subject to awards of damages if we are found to have infringed such patents or rights.
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of others (including those relating to trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets). other parties may allege that they own blocking patents to our products in clinical development or even to products that have received regulatory approval and are being or have been commercialized, either because they claim to hold proprietary rights to the composition of a product or the way it is manufactured or the way it is used. moreover, other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to antibody-based products made using our velocimmune technology, or any other of our technologies, either because of the way the antibodies are discovered or produced or because of a proprietary composition covering an antibody or the antibody's target.
we have been in the past, are currently, and may in the future be involved in patent litigation and other proceedings involving patents and other intellectual property. for example, we and/or sanofi are currently party to patent infringement proceedings initiated by amgen against us and/or sanofi relating to praluent and patent infringement proceedings relating to dupixent, as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. in addition, we are currently party to patent infringement and other proceedings relating to eylea and regen-cov, as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
we are aware of patents and pending patent applications owned by others that respectively claim antibodies to il-4r and methods of treating conditions including atopic dermatitis and asthma with such antibodies; antibodies to il-6r and methods of treating conditions including rheumatoid arthritis with such antibodies; antibodies to pcsk9 and methods of treating hypercholesterolemia with such antibodies; and antibodies to pd-1 and methods of treating cancer with such antibodies. in addition to dupixent (dupilumab), libtayo (cemiplimab), praluent (alirocumab), and kevzara (sarilumab), our late-stage antibody-based pipeline includes regen-cov, a novel investigational antibody cocktail treatment designed to prevent and treat infection from the sars-cov-2 virus; fasinumab, an antibody to ngf; evkeeza (evinacumab), an antibody to angptl3; garetosmab, an antibody to activin a; pozelimab, an antibody to c5; odronextamab, a bispecific antibody targeting cd20 and cd3; itepekimab, an antibody to il-33; regn5458, a bispecific antibody targeting bcma and cd3; and regn5713-5714-5715, a multi-antibody therapy to betv1.
although we do not believe that any of our products or our late-stage antibody-based product candidates infringe any valid claim in these patents or patent applications, these other parties could initiate lawsuits for patent infringement and assert that their patents are valid and cover our products or our late-stage antibody-based product candidates, similar to the patent infringement proceedings referred to above. further, we are aware of a number of patent applications of others that, if granted with claims as currently drafted, may cover our current or planned activities. it could be determined that our products and/or actions in manufacturing or selling our products or product candidates infringe such patents.
patent holders could assert claims against us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or developing our products or product candidates, and a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of others. in the event that the manufacture, use, or sale of any of our products or product candidates infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of others, we may be prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing, and commercialization of those drugs and may be required to pay costly damages. in addition, in the event that we assert our patent rights against other parties that we believe are infringing our patent rights, such parties may challenge the validity of our patents and we may become the target of litigation, which may result in an outcome that is unfavorable to us. any of these adverse developments may materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. in any event, legal disputes are likely to be costly and time consuming to defend.
we seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in our judgment, such licenses are needed or advisable. for example, in august 2018, we and sanofi entered into a license agreement with bristol-myers squibb, e. r. squibb & sons, and ono pharmaceutical to obtain a license under certain patents owned and/or exclusively licensed by one or more of these parties that includes the right to develop and sell libtayo. if any licenses are required, we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. the failure to obtain any such license could prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of our products or product candidates, which could severely harm our business.
loss or limitation of patent rights, and regulatory pathways for biosimilar competition, could reduce the duration of market exclusivity for our products.
in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which it has market exclusivity. in the united states and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there usually are very substantial and rapid declines in the product's sales.
if our late-stage product candidates or other clinical candidates are approved for marketing in the united states or elsewhere, market exclusivity for those products will generally be based upon patent rights and/or certain regulatory forms of exclusivity. as described above under "if we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, or our patents or other means of defending our intellectual property are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our business and competitive position will be harmed," the scope and enforceability of our patent rights may vary from country to country. the failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property rights, or limitations on the use, or the loss, of such rights could materially harm us. absent patent protection or regulatory exclusivity for our products, it is possible, both in the united states and elsewhere, that generic, biosimilar, and/or interchangeable versions of those products may be approved and marketed, which would likely result in substantial and rapid reductions in revenues from sales of those products.
under the ppaca, there is an abbreviated path in the united states for regulatory approval of products that are demonstrated to be "biosimilar" or "interchangeable" with an fda-approved biological product. the ppaca provides a regulatory mechanism that allows for fda approval of biologic drugs that are similar to innovative drugs on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full bla. under this regulation, an application for approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product. however, qualified innovative biological products receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the fda may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the fda. however, the term of regulatory exclusivity may not remain at 12 years in the united states and could be shortened if, for example, the ppaca is amended.
a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states have also established abbreviated pathways for regulatory approval of biological products that are biosimilar to earlier versions of biological products. for example, the eu has had an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars since 2005.
the increased likelihood of biosimilar competition has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. it is also not possible to predict changes in united states regulatory law that might reduce biological product regulatory exclusivity. due to this risk, and uncertainties regarding patent protection, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for any particular product we currently or may in the future commercialize with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory exclusivity. we are aware of several companies developing biosimilar versions of eylea. in the united states, the regulatory exclusivity period for eylea (i.e., the period during which no biosimilar product can be approved by the fda) expires on november 18, 2023, with the possibility of an additional six months of regulatory exclusivity (i.e., until may 18, 2024) if the fda grants pediatric exclusivity based on our completion of certain studies evaluating eylea in pediatric patients with retinopathy of prematurity and submission of the data from these studies to the fda no later than 15 months before the date on which regulatory exclusivity would otherwise expire. the loss of market exclusivity for a product (such as eylea) would likely materially and negatively affect revenues from product sales of that product and thus our financial results and condition.
risks related to manufacturing and supply we rely on limited internal and contracted manufacturing and supply chain capacity, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our marketed products and, if approved, our product candidates and to advance our clinical pipeline.
we have large-scale manufacturing operations in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland. manufacturing facilities operated by us and by third-party contract manufacturers engaged by us would be inadequate to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredients of our current marketed products and our product candidates in sufficient clinical quantities if our clinical pipeline advances as planned. for example, our internal manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient to cover the demand for regen-cov, our novel investigational antibody cocktail treatment designed to prevent and treat infection from the sars-cov-2 virus, which in november 2020 received an eua from the fda for the treatment of mild to moderate covid-19. in addition to expanding our internal capacity, we intend to continue to rely on our collaborators, and may also rely on contract manufacturers, to produce commercial quantities of drug material needed for commercialization of our products. for example, as described in part i, item 1. "business," in august 2020, we announced a collaboration agreement with roche to develop, manufacture, and distribute regen-cov. we cannot be certain that the technology transfer process required to allow roche to manufacture regen-cov will be completed in the expected time frame or at all nor can we be certain that this collaboration will result in the anticipated increase in the current manufacturing and distribution capacity for regen-cov or that any increased manufacturing and distribution capacity will be sufficient. as we increase our production in anticipation of potential regulatory approval for our product candidates, our current manufacturing capacity will likely not be sufficient, and our dependence on our collaborators and/or contract manufacturers may increase, to produce adequate quantities of drug material for both commercial and clinical purposes. we rely entirely on other parties and our collaborators for filling and finishing services, including with respect to drug-delivery devices (such as a pre-filled syringe, patch pump, auto-injector, or other delivery system). generally, in order for other parties to perform any step in the manufacturing and supply chain, we must transfer technology to the other party, which can be time consuming and may not be successfully accomplished without considerable cost and expense, or at all. we will have to depend on these other parties to perform effectively on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory requirements. if for any reason they are unable to do so, and as a result we are unable to directly or through other parties manufacture and supply sufficient commercial and clinical quantities of our products on acceptable terms, or if we should encounter delays or other difficulties with our collaborators, contract manufacturers, warehouses, shipping, testing laboratories, or other parties involved in our supply chain which adversely affect the timely manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.
expanding our manufacturing capacity and establishing fill/finish capabilities will be costly and we may be unsuccessful in doing so in a timely manner, which could delay or prevent the launch and successful commercialization of our marketed products and product candidates or other indications for our marketed products if they are approved for marketing and could jeopardize our current and future clinical development programs.
in addition to our existing manufacturing facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, we may lease, operate, purchase, or construct additional facilities to conduct expanded manufacturing or other related activities in the future. expanding our manufacturing capacity to supply commercial quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for our marketed products and our product candidates if they are approved for marketing, and to supply clinical drug material to support the continued growth of our clinical programs, will require substantial additional expenditures, time, and various regulatory approvals and permits. this also holds true for establishing fill/finish capabilities in the future, for which we have taken initial steps. further, we will need to hire and train significant numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our expanding manufacturing and supply chain operations, as well as any future fill/finish activities. start-up costs can be large, and scale-up entails significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields. in addition, we may face difficulties or delays in developing or acquiring the necessary production equipment and technology to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. the fda and analogous foreign regulatory authorities must determine that our existing and any expanded manufacturing facilities and any future fill/finish activities comply, or continue to comply, with cgmp requirements for both clinical and commercial production and license them, or continue to license them, accordingly, and such facilities must also comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other governmental permitting requirements. we may not successfully expand or establish sufficient manufacturing or any future fill/finish capabilities or manufacture our products economically or in compliance with cgmps and other regulatory requirements, and we and our collaborators may not be able to build or procure additional capacity in the required timeframe to meet commercial demand for our product candidates if they receive regulatory approval, and to continue to meet the requirements of our clinical programs. this would interfere with our efforts to successfully commercialize our marketed products, and could also delay or require us to discontinue one or more of our clinical development programs. as a result, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed.
our ability to manufacture products may be impaired if any of our or our collaborators' manufacturing activities, or the activities of other third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain, are found to infringe patents of others.
our ability to continue to manufacture products in our rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland facilities and at additional facilities (if any) in the future (including our ability to conduct any fill/finish activities in the future), the ability of our collaborators to manufacture products at their facilities, and our ability to utilize other third parties to produce our products, to supply raw materials or other products, or to perform fill/finish services or other steps in our manufacture and supply chain, depends on our and their ability to operate without infringing the patents or other intellectual property rights of others. other parties may allege that our or our collaborators' manufacturing activities, or the activities of other third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain (which may be located in jurisdictions outside the united states), infringe patents or other intellectual property rights. for example, we are currently party to patent infringement and other proceedings relating to the eylea pre-filled syringe, as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. a judicial or regulatory decision in favor of one or more parties making such allegations could directly or indirectly preclude the manufacture of our products to which those intellectual property rights apply on a temporary or permanent basis, which could materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
if sales of our marketed products do not meet the levels currently expected, or if the launch of any of our product candidates is delayed or unsuccessful, we may face costs related to excess inventory or unused capacity at our manufacturing facilities and at the facilities of third parties or our collaborators.
we use our manufacturing facilities primarily to produce bulk product for commercial supply of our marketed products and clinical and preclinical candidates for ourselves and our collaborations. we also plan to use such facilities to produce bulk product for commercial supply of new indications of our marketed products and new product candidates if they are approved for marketing. if our clinical candidates are discontinued or their clinical development is delayed, if the launch of new indications for our marketed products or new product candidates is delayed or does not occur, or if such products are launched and the launch is unsuccessful or the product is subsequently recalled or marketing approval is rescinded, we may have to absorb one hundred percent of related overhead costs and inefficiencies, as well as similar costs of third-party contract manufacturers performing services for us. in addition, if we or our collaborators experience excess inventory, it may be necessary to write down or write off such excess inventory or incur an impairment charge with respect to the facility where such product is manufactured, which could adversely affect our operating results.
third-party service or supply failures, or other failures, business interruptions, or other disasters affecting our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, the manufacturing facilities of our collaborators, or the facilities of any other party participating in the supply chain, would adversely affect our ability to supply our products.
bulk drug materials are currently manufactured at our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, as well as at our collaborators' facilities. we and our collaborators would be unable to manufacture these materials if the relevant facility were to cease production due to regulatory requirements or actions, business interruptions, labor shortages or disputes, contaminations, fire, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, or other problems.
many of our products and product candidates are very difficult to manufacture. as our products and product candidates are biologics, they require processing steps that are more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. accordingly, multiple steps are needed to control the manufacturing processes. problems with these manufacturing processes, even minor deviations from the normal process or from the materials used in the manufacturing process (which may not be detectable by us or our collaborators in a timely manner), could lead to product defects or manufacturing failures, resulting in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims, and insufficient inventory. also, the complexity of our manufacturing process may make it difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to transfer our technology to our collaborators or contract manufacturers.
also, certain raw materials or other products necessary for the manufacture and formulation of our marketed products and product candidates, some of which are difficult to source, are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. in addition, we rely on certain third parties or our collaborators to perform filling, finishing, distribution, laboratory testing, and other services related to the manufacture of our marketed products and product candidates, and to supply various raw materials and other products. we would be unable to obtain these raw materials, other products, or services for an indeterminate period of time if any of these third parties were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials, products, or services to us for any reason, including due to regulatory requirements or actions (including recalls), adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier, failure by the supplier to comply with cgmps, contaminations, business interruptions, or labor shortages or disputes (in each case, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic). in any such circumstances, we may not be able to engage a backup or alternative supplier or service provider in a timely manner or at all. this, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our or our collaborators' ability to manufacture or supply marketed products and product candidates, which could materially and adversely affect our business and future prospects.
certain of the raw materials required in the manufacture and testing of our products and product candidates may be derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum, and human serum albumin. there are certain regulatory restrictions on using these biological source materials. if we or our collaborators are required to substitute for these sources to comply with such regulatory requirements, our clinical development or commercial activities may be delayed or interrupted.
our or our collaborators' failure to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of drug products or product candidates could result in incurring substantial remedial costs, delays in the development or approval of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products and/or in their commercial launch if regulatory approval is obtained, and a reduction in sales.
we and our collaborators and other third-party providers are required to maintain compliance with cgmps, and are subject to inspections by the fda or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing may require amending our application(s) to the fda or such comparable foreign agencies and acceptance of the change by the fda or such comparable foreign agencies prior to release of product(s). because we produce multiple products and product candidates at our facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, there are increased risks associated with cgmp compliance. our inability, or the inability of our collaborators and third-party fill/finish or other service providers, to demonstrate ongoing cgmp compliance could require us to engage in lengthy and expensive remediation efforts, withdraw or recall product, halt or interrupt clinical trials, and/or interrupt commercial supply of any marketed products, and could also delay or prevent our obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products. any delay, interruption, or other issue that arises in the manufacture, fill/finish, packaging, or storage of any drug product or product candidate as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of our collaborators or other third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection or maintain cgmp compliance could significantly impair our ability to develop, obtain approval for, and successfully commercialize our products, which would substantially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. any finding of non-compliance could also increase our costs, cause us to delay the development of our product candidates, result in delay in our obtaining, or our not obtaining, regulatory approval of product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, and cause us to lose revenue from any marketed products, which could be seriously detrimental to our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions and damage our reputation.
other regulatory and litigation risks if the testing or use of our products harms people, or is perceived to harm them even when such harm is unrelated to our products, we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.
the testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs for use in people expose us to product liability risk. any informed consent or waivers obtained from people who enroll in our clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the cost of litigation. we may also be subject to claims by patients who use our approved products, or our product candidates if those product candidates receive regulatory approval and become commercially available, that they have been injured by a side effect associated with the drug. even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our products or product candidates, the related investigation may be time consuming or inconclusive and may have a negative impact on our reputation or business. we may face product liability claims and be found responsible even if injury arises from the acts or omissions of third parties who provide fill/finish or other services. to the extent we maintain product liability insurance in relevant periods, such insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability arising from any such litigation. moreover, in the future we may not have access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms.
our business activities have been, and may in the future be, challenged under federal or state healthcare laws, which may subject us to civil or criminal proceedings, investigations, or penalties.
the fda regulates the marketing and promotion of our products, which must comply with the food, drug, and cosmetic act and applicable fda implementing standards. the fda's review of promotional activities includes healthcare provider-directed and direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and sales representatives' communications. failure to comply with applicable fda requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the fda, the department of justice, or the office of the inspector general of the hhs, as well as state authorities. this could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes a drug. the fda may take enforcement action for promoting unapproved uses of a product or other violations of its advertising laws and regulations. the applicable regulations in countries outside the u.s. grant similar powers to the competent authorities and impose similar obligations on companies.
in addition to fda and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care "fraud and abuse" laws, such as the federal civil false claims act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal social security act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. the u.s. federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute (the "aks") prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving payments or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward someone to purchase, prescribe, endorse, arrange for, or recommend a product or service that is reimbursed under federal healthcare programs such as medicare or medicaid. if we provide payments or other remuneration to a healthcare professional to induce the prescribing of our products, we could face liability under state and federal anti-kickback laws. recently, the bipartisan budget act of 2018 increased the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal health care laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute.
the federal civil false claims act prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. the false claims act also permits a private individual acting as a "whistleblower" to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. pharmaceutical companies have been investigated and/or prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the fda has not approved, known as off-label uses, that caused claims to be submitted to medicaid for non-covered off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the medicaid rebate program. pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment for individuals and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. even if it is determined that we have not violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which would harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be challenged under one or more of such laws. as described further in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, we are party to a civil complaint filed in june 2020 by the u.s. attorney's office for the district of massachusetts concerning our support of 501(c)(3) organizations that provide financial assistance to patients; and we are cooperating with a pending government investigation concerning certain other business activities. any adverse decision, finding, allegation, or exercise of enforcement or regulatory discretion in any such proceedings or investigations could harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
as part of the ppaca, the federal government requires that pharmaceutical manufacturers record any "transfers of value" made to u.s. prescribers and certain other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. information provided by companies is aggregated and posted annually on an "open payments" website, which is managed by cms, the agency responsible for implementing these disclosure requirements. beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information (starting with information collected during 2021) regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.
we continue to dedicate significant resources to comply with these requirements and need to be prepared to comply with additional reporting obligations outside of the united states that may apply in the future. in addition, several states have legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities; restrict when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals or gifts to prescribers or engage in other marketing-related activities; require identification or licensing of sales representatives; and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. many of these requirements and standards are new or uncertain, and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements may be unclear. if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity, which would harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. additionally, access to such data by fraud-and-abuse investigators and industry critics may draw scrutiny to our collaborations with reported entities.
if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.
we participate in the medicaid drug rebate program, the 340b program, the va fss pricing program, and the tricare retail pharmacy program. see part i, item 1, "business - government regulation - pricing and reimbursement" for a description of these programs.
pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. such interpretation can change and evolve over time. in the case of our medicaid pricing data, if we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the medicaid drug rebate program and could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters. price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products under the 340b program.
civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price or product information to the government, if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, if we fail to submit the required price data on a timely basis, or if we are found to have charged 340b covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. the cms could also decide to terminate our medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under medicaid or medicare part b for our covered outpatient drugs.
our failure to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program and other governmental programs could negatively impact our financial results. cms issued a final regulation, which became effective on april 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the medicaid drug rebate program under the ppaca. the issuance of the final regulation, as well as any other regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the medicaid drug rebate program, has increased and will continue to increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, has been and will continue to be time-consuming to implement, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly if cms challenges the approach we take in our implementation of the final regulation.
the hrsa issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340b ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on january 1, 2019. implementation of this regulation could affect our obligations and potential liability under the 340b program in ways we cannot anticipate. we are also required to report the 340b ceiling prices for our covered outpatient drugs to hrsa, which then publishes them to 340b covered entities. any charge by hrsa that we have violated the requirements of the program or the regulation could negatively impact our financial results. moreover, under a final regulation effective january 13, 2021, hrsa newly established an adr process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. such claims are to be resolved through an adr panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. an adr proceeding could subject us to onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability. further, any additional future changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the medicaid rebate amount under the ppaca or otherwise could affect our 340b ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.
we have obligations to report the average sales price for certain of our drugs to the medicare program. statutory or regulatory changes or cms guidance could affect the average sales price calculations for our products and the resulting medicare payment rate, and could negatively impact our results of operations.
pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with price reporting or contract‐based requirements under the va/fss and/or tricare programs can subject a manufacturer to civil monetary penalties. these program and contract-based obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements. if we overcharge the government in connection with our arrangements with fss or tricare, we are required to refund the difference to the government. failure to make necessary disclosures or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the false claims act and other laws and regulations. unexpected refunds to the government, and/or response to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.
risks from the improper conduct of employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators could adversely affect our reputation and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
we cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies, and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including, without limitation, healthcare, employment, foreign corrupt practices, trade restrictions and sanctions, environmental, competition, and privacy laws and regulations. such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, and monetary and injunctive penalties, and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, operating results, and reputation.
in particular, our business activities outside of the united states are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the u.k. bribery act. the fcpa generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-u.s. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. the fcpa also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-u.s. governments. additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa. recently the securities and exchange commission, or sec, and department of justice have increased their fcpa enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. there is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our ability to expand internationally, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, and we may incur substantial liability arising from our activities involving the use of hazardous materials.
as a fully integrated biotechnology company with significant research and development and manufacturing operations, we are subject to extensive environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials. our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals, infectious agents (such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi), radioactive compounds, and other hazardous materials. the cost of compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations is substantial. if an accident involving these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, or face regulatory actions, which could exceed our resources or insurance coverage.
our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure, and accounting requirements and regulations that could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
we are subject to changing rules and regulations of various federal and state governmental authorities as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. these entities, including the sec and the nasdaq stock market llc, have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional requirements and regulations in response to laws enacted by congress, including the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and the dodd-frank wall street reform and protection act, or the dodd-frank act. there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the dodd-frank act that expressly authorized or required the sec to adopt additional rules in these areas, a number of which have yet to be fully implemented. our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management's time from other business activities.
changes in laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.
all aspects of our business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, pricing, sales, intellectual property rights, and the framework for dispute resolution and asserting our rights against others, are subject to extensive legislation and regulation. changes in applicable federal and state laws and agency regulations could have a materially negative impact on our business. these include:
•changes in the fda and foreign regulatory processes for new therapeutics that may delay or prevent the approval of any of our current or future product candidates;
•new laws, regulations, or judicial decisions related to healthcare availability or the payment for healthcare products and services, including prescription drugs, that would make it more difficult for us to market and sell products once they are approved by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies;
•changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring prior to or after the introduction of new products to market, which could materially increase our costs of doing business; and
•changes in fda and foreign cgmp requirements that may make it more difficult and costly for us to maintain regulatory compliance and/or manufacture our marketed product and product candidates in accordance with cgmps.
as described above, the ppaca and potential regulations thereunder easing the entry of competing follow-on biologics into the marketplace, other new legislation or implementation of existing statutory provisions on importation of lower-cost competing drugs from other jurisdictions, and legislation on comparative effectiveness research are examples of previously enacted and possible future changes in laws that could adversely affect our business.
the u.s. government could carry out other significant changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy, including with respect to government reimbursement changes and drug price control measures (such as those discussed above under "risks related to commercialization of our marketed products, product candidates, and new indications for our marketed products - sales of our marketed products are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition"). while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes in the laws, regulations, and policies governing the development and approval of our product candidates and the commercialization, importation, and reimbursement of our products could adversely affect our business. in addition, our development and commercialization activities could be harmed or delayed by a shutdown of the u.s. government, including the fda. for example, a prolonged shutdown may significantly delay the fda's ability to timely review and process any submissions we have filed or may file or cause other regulatory delays, which could materially and adversely affect our business.
risks associated with our operations outside of the united states could adversely affect our business.
we have operations and conduct business outside the united states and we plan to expand these activities. consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries, which include:
•unfamiliar foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements;
•other laws and regulatory requirements to which our business activities abroad are subject, such as the fcpa and the u.k. bribery act (discussed in greater detail above under "risks from the improper conduct of employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators could adversely affect our reputation and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition");
•changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region;
•fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the u.s. dollar;
•tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes, and sanctions (including those administered by the office of foreign assets control of the u.s. department of the treasury), and other trade barriers;
•difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel; and
•cultural differences in the conduct of business.
for example, effective january 31, 2020, the united kingdom commenced an exit from the eu, commonly referred to as "brexit." the transition period for brexit expired on december 31, 2020 following the entry into a trade agreement that now governs the united kingdom's relationship with the eu. we do not know to what extent brexit will ultimately impact the business and regulatory environment in the united kingdom, the rest of the eu, or other countries. for example, the impact of brexit on the ongoing validity in the united kingdom of current eu authorizations for medicinal products and on the future process for obtaining marketing authorization for pharmaceutical products manufactured or sold in the united kingdom remains uncertain. we have large-scale manufacturing operations in limerick, ireland and have also established an office in the vicinity of london. changes impacting our ability to conduct business in the united kingdom or other eu countries, or changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in those countries (such as with respect to the approval of our product candidates), may materially and adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
we may incur additional tax liabilities related to our operations.
we are subject to income tax in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities, and our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of the applicable statutory rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. we record liabilities for uncertain tax positions that involve significant management judgment as to the application of law. the internal revenue service or other domestic or foreign taxing authorities have previously disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our interpretation of tax law as applied to the operations of regeneron and its subsidiaries or with the positions we may take with respect to particular tax issues on our tax returns (see also note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report). consequently, our reported effective tax rate and our after-tax cash flows may be materially and adversely affected by tax assessments or judgments in excess of accrued amounts we have estimated in preparing our financial statements. further, our effective tax rate may also be adversely affected by numerous other factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in tax laws and regulations, and tax effects of the accounting for stock-based compensation (which depend in part on the price of our stock and, therefore, are beyond our control). due to the results of the recent u.s. presidential and congressional elections, the potential for u.s. tax law changes exists, including as a result of proposals to increase the income tax rate on both domestic and foreign income. increases to the income tax rate or other changes to the tax law could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability, and effective tax rate. the pressure to generate tax revenue to offset economic relief measures due to the covid-19 pandemic could increase the likelihood of adverse tax law changes being enacted. in addition, recommendations by the organization for economic co-operation and development and the european union could require companies to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny. even though we regularly assess the information provided to tax authorities in determining the appropriateness of our tax reserves, such tax authorities could take a position that is contrary to our expectations, and the result could adversely affect our provision for income tax and our current rate.
we face potential liability related to the personal information we collect from individuals, data brokers, or research institutions or obtain from clinical trials sponsored by us or our collaborators.
most u.s. health care providers, including research institutions from which we or our collaborators obtain clinical trial data, are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under hipaa. for example, as part of our human genetics initiative, our wholly-owned subsidiary, regeneron genetics center llc, has entered into collaborations with research institutions, including the geisinger health system, which are subject to such regulations. regeneron is not currently classified as a covered entity or business associate under hipaa and thus is not subject to its requirements or penalties. however, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a hipaa-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by hipaa. consequently, depending on the facts and circumstances, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a hipaa-covered health care provider or research institution that has not satisfied hipaa's requirements for disclosure of individually identifiable health information. there are instances where we collect and maintain sensitive personally identifiable information, which may include health information outside of the scope of hipaa. this information may be received throughout the clinical trial process, in the course of our research collaborations, directly from individuals who enroll in our patient assistance programs, and from our own employees in a pandemic response process (such as in connection with the covid-19 pandemic). in the case of a breach of personal information we may be subject to state breach notification laws requiring notification of affected individuals and state regulators.
our patient assistance programs and product marketing activities as part of which we collect california resident personal data are subject to the ccpa. the ccpa, which became effective on january 1, 2020, is a consumer protection law that establishes certain requirements for data use and sharing transparency and provides california residents with personal data privacy rights regarding the use, disclosure, and retention of their personal data. the ccpa requires us, among other things, to update our notices and develop new processes internally and with our partners. amendments to the ccpa and legislative proposals at the federal and state level could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may impose limitations on our business activities. several other u.s. states have introduced similar consumer protection laws that may go into effect in the near future.
our clinical trial programs and research collaborations outside the u.s. (such as our consortium with a group of companies to fund the generation of genetic exome sequence data from the uk biobank health resource) implicate international data protection laws, including the gdpr. the gdpr has created a range of new compliance obligations, including increased transparency requirements and new data subject rights. violations of the gdpr carry significant financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher)). in addition to the gdpr, certain eu member states have issued or will be issuing their own implementation legislation. while we continue to monitor these developments, there remains some uncertainty surrounding the legal and regulatory environment for these evolving privacy and data protection laws. complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance, including the risk of substantial financial penalties for insufficient notice and consent, failure to respond to data subject rights requests, lack of a legal basis for the transfer of personal information out of the eu, or improper processing of personal data under the gdpr. failure by our collaborators to comply with the strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the eu into the u.s. may result in the imposition of criminal and administrative sanctions on such collaborators, which could adversely affect our business and could create liability for us.
furthermore, health privacy laws, data breach notification laws, consumer protection laws, data localization laws, and genetic testing laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our collection, use, and dissemination of individuals' health and other personal information. moreover, individuals about whom we or our collaborators obtain health or other personal information, as well as the providers and third parties who share this information with us, may have statutory or contractual limits that impact our ability to use and disclose the information. we are likely to be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws both inside and outside the united states. many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and have different effects. many of the state laws enable a state attorney general to bring actions and provide private rights of action to consumers as enforcement mechanisms. compliance with these laws requires a flexible privacy framework as they are constantly evolving. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity. federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs' attorneys have been active in this space. claims that we have violated individuals' privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.
if we or any collaborators fail to comply with applicable federal, state, local, or foreign regulatory requirements, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions that could affect our or any collaborators' ability to commercialize our products and could harm, prevent, or substantially increase the cost of marketing and sales of any affected products that we are able to commercialize. any threatened or actual government enforcement action could also generate adverse publicity and require that we devote substantial resources that could otherwise be used in other aspects of our business.
increasing use of social media could give rise to liability, breaches of data security, or reputational damage.
we and our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools as a means of communication both internally and externally. despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules, there is a risk that the use of social media by us or our employees to communicate about our products or business may cause us to be found in violation of applicable requirements. in addition, our employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that may not comply with our social media policy or other legal or contractual requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or result in public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or our products in social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image, and goodwill. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
risks related to our reliance on third parties if our antibody collaboration or our io collaboration with sanofi is terminated, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain of our products and product candidates in the time expected, or at all, would be materially harmed.
we rely on funding and support from sanofi to develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain of our products and product candidates. with respect to the products that we are co-developing with sanofi under our antibody collaboration (currently consisting of dupixent, kevzara, and itepekimab), sanofi funds a significant portion of development expenses incurred in connection with the development of these products. in addition, we rely on sanofi to lead much of the clinical development efforts, assist with or lead efforts to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals, and lead the commercialization efforts for these products and product candidates.
we are developing muc16xcd3 program antibodies (such as regn4018) and bcmaxcd3 program antibodies (such as regn5458 and regn5459) under the amended and restated io discovery and development agreement with sanofi and sanofi has the right to elect to co-develop these antibodies under our io collaboration. if sanofi does not elect to co-develop muc16xcd3 program antibodies or bcmaxcd3 program antibodies under our io collaboration, or opts out of their development under our io collaboration, we will be required to fund and conduct on our own all such efforts to support those product candidates, unless we enter into arrangements with other parties.
if sanofi elects to co-develop bcmaxcd3 program antibodies and/or muc16xcd3 program antibodies under our io collaboration, sanofi will initially fund the development expenses incurred in connection with the development of bcmaxcd3 program antibodies, for which sanofi will be the principal controlling party, and half of the development expenses incurred in connection with the clinical development of muc16xcd3 program antibodies, for which we will be the principal controlling party. under our io collaboration, sanofi also funds half of the development expenses incurred in connection with the clinical development of libtayo, subject to an agreed-upon development budget. in addition, if sanofi elects to co-develop bcmaxcd3 program antibodies, sanofi will lead much of the clinical development efforts and assist with obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval. we also rely on sanofi to lead commercialization efforts outside the united states for libtayo. following regulatory approval, we will rely on sanofi to lead (i) the commercialization efforts in the united states for bcmaxcd3 program antibodies and (ii) the commercialization efforts outside the united states for muc16xcd3 program antibodies and bcmaxcd3 program antibodies.
if sanofi terminates the antibody collaboration or the io collaboration or fails to comply with its payment obligations under any of our collaborations, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed. we would be required to either expend substantially more resources than we have anticipated to support our research and development efforts, which could require us to seek additional funding that might not be available on favorable terms or at all, or materially cut back on such activities. if sanofi does not perform its obligations with respect to the product candidates that it elects to co-develop, our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize these product candidates will be significantly adversely affected. we have limited commercial capabilities outside the united states and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities for products commercialized under our antibody collaboration or our io collaboration (see also "risks related to commercialization of our marketed products, product candidates, and new indications for our marketed products - if we are unable to establish commercial capabilities outside the united states for products we intend to commercialize or co-commercialize outside the united states, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected" above). termination of the antibody collaboration or the io collaboration would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and commercialization of the products subject to such collaborations, particularly outside the united states.
if our collaboration with bayer for eylea is terminated, or bayer materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and our ability to continue to commercialize eylea outside the united states would be materially harmed.
we rely heavily on bayer with respect to the commercialization of eylea outside the united states. bayer is responsible for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval outside the united states, as well as providing all sales, marketing, and commercial support for the product outside the united states. in particular, bayer has responsibility for selling eylea outside the united states using its sales force and, in japan, in cooperation with santen pursuant to a co-promotion and distribution agreement, as in effect from time to time, with bayer's japanese affiliate. if bayer and, in japan, santen do not perform their obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to commercialize eylea outside the united states will be significantly adversely affected. bayer has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon six or twelve months' advance notice, depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination. if bayer were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us, we may not have the resources or skills to replace those of our collaborator, which could require us to seek another collaboration that might not be available on favorable terms or at all, and could cause significant issues for the commercialization of eylea outside the united states and result in substantial additional costs and/or lower revenues to us. we have limited commercial capabilities outside the united states and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities (see also "risks related to commercialization of our marketed products, product candidates, and new indications for our marketed products - if we are unable to establish commercial capabilities outside the united states for products we intend to commercialize or co-commercialize outside the united states, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected" above). termination of the bayer collaboration agreement would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful commercialization of eylea outside the united states.
our collaborators and service providers may fail to perform adequately in their efforts to support the development, manufacture, and commercialization of our drug candidates and current and future products.
we depend upon third-party collaborators, including sanofi and bayer, and service providers such as cros, outside testing laboratories, clinical investigator sites, third-party manufacturers, fill/finish providers, and product packagers and labelers, to assist us in the manufacture and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. we also depend, or will depend, on some of these third parties in connection with the commercialization of our marketed products and our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products if they are approved for marketing. if any of our existing collaborators or service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its development or manufacturing services under an agreement in a timely manner (including as a result of its inability to perform due to financial or other relevant constraints) or in compliance with applicable gmps, glps, or gcp standards, we could experience additional costs, delays, and difficulties in the manufacture or development of, or in obtaining approval by regulatory authorities for, or successfully commercializing our product candidates.
we and our collaborators rely on third-party service providers to support the distribution of our marketed products and for many other related activities in connection with the commercialization of these marketed products. despite our or our collaborators' arrangements with them, these third parties may not perform adequately. if these service providers do not perform their services adequately, sales of our marketed products will suffer.
risk related to employees we are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research, development, manufacturing, and commercial organizations, our business will be harmed.
we are highly dependent on certain of our executive officers, other key members of our senior management team, and our chairman. if we are not able to retain (or for any other reason lose the services of) any of these persons, our business may suffer. in particular, we depend on the services of p. roy vagelos, m.d., the chairman of our board of directors; leonard s. schleifer, m.d., ph.d., our president and chief executive officer; and george d. yancopoulos, m.d., ph.d., our president and chief scientific officer. we are also highly dependent on the expertise and services of other senior management members leading our research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts. there is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the research, development, manufacture, and commercialization of drugs. we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary to continue to advance our business and achieve our strategic objectives.
information technology risks significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.
our business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex, and interdependent information technology systems, including internet-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. these systems are also critical to enable remote working arrangements, which have been growing in importance due in part to the covid-19 pandemic and our implementation of work-from-home policies for a significant part of our employees. the size and complexity of our computer systems make us potentially vulnerable to it system breakdowns, internal and external malicious intrusion, and computer viruses and ransomware, which may impact product production and key business processes. we also have outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and operations to third parties, which may allow them to access our confidential information and may also make our systems vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by such third parties or others.
in addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches - whether by employees or others - which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, result in demands for ransom or other forms of blackmail, or lead to the public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including industrial espionage or extortion) and expertise, including by organized criminal groups, "hacktivists," nation states, and others. as a company with an increasingly global presence, our systems are subject to frequent attacks. due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that an attack may remain undetected for a period of time. while we continue to make investments to improve the protection of data and information technology, and to oversee and monitor the security measures of our third-party service providers, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. in addition, we depend in part on third-party security measures over which we do not have full control to protect against data security breaches.
if we or our third-party service providers fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data security effectively, or fail to anticipate, plan for, or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we or our third-party service providers could have difficulty preventing, detecting, or controlling such disruptions or security breaches, which could result in legal proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disruptions to our operations, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
risks related to our financial results, liquidity, and need for additional financing if we cannot sustain profitability, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed.
if we cannot sustain profitability, we may be unable to continue our operations. in the absence of substantial revenue from the sale of products on an ongoing basis, including our net product sales of eylea and funding we receive under our collaboration agreements (including our share of profits in connection with commercialization of eylea and dupixent under our collaboration agreements with bayer and sanofi, respectively), or from other sources, the amount, timing, nature, or source of which cannot be predicted, we may incur substantial losses again as we conduct our research and development activities, commercialize our approved products, and prepare for possible commercialization of our other product candidates and new indications of our marketed products.
we may need additional funding in the future, which may not be available to us, and which may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
we expend substantial resources for research and development, including costs associated with clinical testing of our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products, the commercialization of products, and capital expenditures. we believe our existing capital resources and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, together with funds generated by our current and anticipated eylea net product sales and funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements (including our share of profits in connection with commercialization of eylea and dupixent under our collaboration agreements with bayer and sanofi, respectively), will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs for the foreseeable future. however, one or more of our collaboration agreements may terminate, our revenues may fall short of our projections or be delayed, or our expenses may increase, any of which could result in our capital being consumed significantly faster than anticipated. our expenses may increase for many reasons, including expenses in connection with the commercialization of our marketed products and the potential commercial launches of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products, manufacturing scale-up, expenses related to clinical trials testing of antibody-based product candidates we are developing on our own (without a collaborator), and expenses for which we are responsible in accordance with the terms of our collaboration agreements.
we cannot be certain that our existing capital resources and our current and anticipated revenues will be sufficient to meet our operating needs. we may require additional financing in the future and we may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms or at all. for example, there is no guarantee that we will have the ability to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity or redeem, repurchase, or refinance the notes prior to maturity on acceptable terms or at all. in addition, in march 2017, we completed a $720.0 million lease financing for our existing corporate headquarters and other rentable area consisting of approximately 150 acres of predominately office buildings and laboratory space located in tarrytown, new york, which will become due and payable in full on the five-year anniversary of the closing date unless extended with the consent of all the participants and subject to certain other conditions. our ability to refinance or to obtain additional financing could be adversely affected if there is a significant decline in the demand for our products or other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions. volatility in the financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to raise capital. if additional financing is necessary and we obtain it through the sale of equity securities, such sales will likely be dilutive to our shareholders. debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may be at interest rates and contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders. should we require and be unable to raise sufficient funds (i) to complete the development of our product candidates, (ii) to successfully commercialize our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products if they obtain regulatory approval, and (iii) to continue our manufacturing and marketing of our marketed products, we may face delay, reduction, or elimination of our research and development or preclinical or clinical programs and our commercialization activities, which would significantly limit our potential to generate revenue.
our indebtedness could adversely impact our business.
we have certain indebtedness and contingent liabilities, including milestone and royalty payment obligations. as of december 31, 2020, we had an aggregate of $2.696 billion of outstanding indebtedness under the notes and the lease financing facility. we may also incur additional debt in the future. any such indebtedness could:
•limit our ability to access capital markets and incur additional debt in the future;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts, research and development, and mergers and acquisitions; and
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
our revenue from outside of the united states will increase as our products, whether marketed or otherwise commercialized by us or our collaborators, gain marketing approval in such jurisdictions. our primary foreign currency exposure relates to movements in the japanese yen, euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, and australian dollar. if the u.s. dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will increase, having a positive impact on net income, but our overall expenses will increase, having a negative impact. conversely, if the u.s. dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will decrease, having a negative impact on net income, but our overall expenses will decrease, having a positive impact. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our operating results and the financial condition of our company.
our investments are subject to risks and other external factors that may result in losses or affect the liquidity of these investments.
as of december 31, 2020, we had $2.194 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $4.529 billion in marketable securities (including $839.8 million in equity securities). our investments consist primarily of debt securities, including investment-grade corporate bonds. these fixed-income investments are subject to external factors that may adversely affect their market value or liquidity, such as interest rate, liquidity, market, and issuer credit risks, including actual or anticipated changes in credit ratings. the equity securities we hold may experience significant volatility and may decline in value or become worthless if the issuer experiences an adverse development. furthermore, our equity investments could be subject to dilution (and decline in value) as a result of the issuance of additional equity interests by the applicable issuer. if any of our investments suffer market price declines, such declines may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
the elimination of libor could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
we are subject to risks related to uncertainty regarding the london interbank offered rate ("libor"). libor is the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause libor to cease to exist after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. while we expect that alternatives to libor will be implemented prior to the 2021 target date or that the 2021 cessation date may be extended, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments. the u.s. federal reserve, in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee, a steering committee comprised of large u.s. financial institutions, has identified the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for libor. at this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to sofr or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from libor is anticipated in coming years. there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate. a transition away from libor as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate may adversely affect our outstanding variable-rate indebtedness and interest rate swaps, as well as floating-rate debt securities we hold. for example, if a published u.s. dollar libor is unavailable after 2021, the rent payments for the leased facilities in tarrytown, new york and interest for borrowings (if any) with an interest rate based on the libor rate under our revolving credit facility, all of which are indexed to libor, will be determined using various alternative methods, any of which may result in interest obligations which are more than, or do not otherwise correlate over time with, the payments that would have been made on such debt if u.s. dollar libor was available in its current form.
risks related to our common stock our stock price is extremely volatile.
there has been significant volatility in our stock price and generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies' securities. various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. these factors include, by way of example:
•net product sales of our marketed products (as recorded by us or our collaborators), in particular eylea, dupixent, and libtayo, as well as our overall operating results;
•if any of our product candidates or our new indications for our marketed products receive regulatory approval, net product sales of, and profits from, these product candidates and new indications;
•market acceptance of, and the market share for, our marketed products, especially eylea, dupixent, and libtayo;
•whether our net product sales and net profits underperform, meet, or exceed the expectations of investors or analysts;
•announcement of actions by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities or their respective advisory committees regarding our, or our collaborators', or our competitors', currently pending or future application(s) for regulatory approval of product candidate(s) or new indications for marketed products;
•announcement of submission of an application for regulatory approval of one or more of our, or our competitors', product candidates or new indications for marketed products;
•progress, delays, or results in clinical trials of our or our competitors' product candidates or new indications for marketed products;
•impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business;
•announcement of technological innovations or product candidates by us or competitors;
•claims by others that our products or technologies infringe their patents;
•challenges by others to our patents in the epo and in the uspto;
•public concern as to the safety or effectiveness of any of our marketed products or product candidates or new indications for our marketed products;
•pricing or reimbursement actions, decisions, or recommendations by government authorities, insurers, or other organizations (such as health maintenance organizations and pbms) affecting the coverage, reimbursement, or use of any of our marketed products or competitors' products;
•our ability to raise additional capital as needed on favorable terms;
•developments in our relationships with collaborators or key customers;
•developments in the biotechnology industry or in government regulation of healthcare, including those relating to compounding (i.e., a practice in which a pharmacist, a physician, or, in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the supervision of a pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient);
•large sales of our common stock by our executive officers or other employees, directors, or significant shareholders (or the expectation of any such sales);
•changes in tax rates, laws, or interpretation of tax laws;
•arrivals and departures of key personnel;
•general market conditions;
•our ability to repurchase our common stock under any share repurchase program on favorable terms or at all;
•trading activity that results from the rebalancing of stock indices in which our common stock is included, or the inclusion or exclusion of our common stock from such indices;
•other factors identified in these "risk factors"; and
•the perception by the investment community or our shareholders of any of the foregoing factors.
the trading price of our common stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to these and other factors, including the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our common stock in the market. as discussed in greater detail under "future sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new share offerings" below, a large percentage of our common stock is owned by a small number of our principal shareholders. as a result, the public float of our common stock (i.e., the portion of our common stock held by public investors, as opposed to the common stock held by our directors, officers, and principal shareholders) may be lower than the public float of other large public companies with broader public ownership. therefore, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. these factors may exacerbate the volatility in the trading price of our common stock and may negatively impact your ability to liquidate your investment in regeneron at the time you wish at a price you consider satisfactory. broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. in the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation, which may harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
future sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new share offerings.
a small number of our shareholders beneficially own a substantial amount of our common stock. as of december 31, 2020, our five largest shareholders plus dr. schleifer, our chief executive officer, beneficially owned approximately 39.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock, assuming, in the case of our chief executive officer, the conversion of his class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within 60 days of december 31, 2020. if our significant shareholders or we sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or there is a perception that such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could fall. sales of common stock by our significant shareholders also might make it more difficult for us to raise funds by selling equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.
there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock or that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices.
in january 2021, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock. any share repurchases will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements, our results of operations and financial condition, the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market, and other factors that we may deem relevant. we can provide no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at favorable prices, if at all.
our existing shareholders may be able to exert substantial influence over matters requiring shareholder approval and over our management.
holders of class a stock, who are generally the shareholders who purchased their stock from us before our initial public offering, are entitled to ten votes per share, while holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share. as of december 31, 2020, holders of class a stock held 15.0% of the combined voting power of all shares of common stock and class a stock then outstanding. these shareholders, if acting together, would be in a position to substantially influence the election of our directors and the vote on certain corporate transactions that require majority or supermajority approval of the combined classes, including mergers and other business combinations. this may result in our taking corporate actions that other shareholders may not consider to be in their best interest and may affect the price of our common stock. as of december 31, 2020:
•our current executive officers and directors beneficially owned 8.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock, assuming conversion of their class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days of december 31, 2020, and 20.0% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock, assuming the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days of december 31, 2020; and
•our five largest shareholders plus dr. schleifer, our chief executive officer, beneficially owned approximately 39.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock, assuming, in the case of our chief executive officer, the conversion of his class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within 60 days of december 31, 2020. in addition, these five shareholders plus our chief executive officer held approximately 46.3% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock, assuming the exercise of all options held by our chief executive officer which are exercisable within 60 days of december 31, 2020.
the anti-takeover effects of provisions of our charter, by-laws, and of new york corporate law, as well as the contractual provisions in our investor and collaboration agreements and certain provisions of our compensation plans and agreements, could deter, delay, or prevent an acquisition or other "change of control" of us and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and the new york business corporation law contain various provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or our management that shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial. some of these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. these provisions include:
•authorization to issue "blank check" preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior shareholder approval, with rights senior to those of our common stock and class a stock;
•a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual shareholder meetings to replace all of our directors;
•a requirement that removal of directors may only be effected for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors, as well as a requirement that any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors;
•a provision whereby any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting, only if, prior to such action, all of our shareholders consent, the effect of which is to require that shareholder action may only be taken at a duly convened meeting;
•a requirement that any shareholder seeking to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of this intention in writing and meet various other requirements; and
•under the new york business corporation law, in addition to certain restrictions which may apply to "business combinations" involving our company and an "interested shareholder," a plan of merger or consolidation of our company must be approved by two-thirds of the votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. see the risk factor above captioned "our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval and over our management."
further, sanofi, bayer, and teva are currently bound by certain "standstill" provisions under the january 2014 amended and restated investor agreement between us and sanofi, as amended; our 2016 ang2 license and collaboration agreement and our 2014 pdgfr-beta license and collaboration agreement with bayer; and our 2016 collaboration agreement with teva, respectively. these provisions contractually prohibit sanofi, bayer, and teva from seeking to directly or indirectly exert control of our company or acquiring more than a specified percentage of our class a stock and common stock, taken together (30% in the case of sanofi, 20% in the case of bayer, and 5% in the case of teva).
in addition, our change in control severance plan and the employment agreement with our chief executive officer, each as amended and restated, provide for severance benefits in the event of termination as a result of a change in control of our company. also, equity awards issued under our long-term incentive plans may become fully vested in connection with a "change in control" of our company, as defined in the plans. these contractual provisions may also have the effect of deterring, delaying, or preventing an acquisition or other change in control.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. refer to part ii, item 7 in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019 (filed with the sec on february 7, 2020) for additional discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018, as well as our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
overview we are a fully integrated biotechnology company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious diseases. our commercialized medicines and product candidates in development are designed to help patients with eye diseases, allergic and inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, pain, infectious diseases, and rare diseases.
as described in part i, item 1. "business," we currently have eight products that have received marketing approval and approximately 30 product candidates in clinical development, almost all of which were homegrown in our laboratories. in addition, regen-cov received emergency use authorization from the fda for the treatment of mild to moderate covid-19 in certain patients at high-risk for progressing to severe covid-19 and/or hospitalization. refer to part i, item 1. "business - products" and "business - programs in clinical development" for additional information.
our ability to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on the continued success in commercializing eylea and dupixent. we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, a portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators. also, our research and development activities outside our collaborations, the costs of which are not reimbursed, are expected to expand and require additional resources. we also expect to incur substantial costs related to the commercialization of our marketed products. our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the net sales of our marketed products; the scope and progress of our research and development efforts; the timing of certain expenses; the continuation of our collaborations, in particular with sanofi and bayer, including our share of collaboration profits or losses from sales of commercialized products and the amount of reimbursement of our research and development expenses that we receive from collaborators; and the amount of income tax expense we incur, which is partly dependent on the profits or losses we earn in each of the countries in which we operate. we cannot predict whether or when new products or new indications for marketed products will receive regulatory approval or, if any such approval is received, whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such product(s) and whether or when they may become profitable.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that impact us is provided in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
•it requires an assumption (or assumptions) regarding a future outcome; and
•changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. the critical accounting estimates that impact our consolidated financial statements are described below.
revenue recognition - product revenue we recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when our customer is deemed to have obtained control of the product, which generally occurs upon receipt by our customer.
the amount of revenue we recognize from product sales may vary due to rebates, chargebacks, and discounts provided under governmental and other programs, distribution-related fees, and other sales-related deductions. in order to determine the transaction price, we estimate, utilizing the expected value method, the amount of variable consideration that we will be entitled to. this estimate is based upon contracts with customers and government agencies, statutorily-defined discounts applicable to government-funded programs, historical experience, estimated payor mix, and other relevant factors. calculating these provisions involves estimates and judgments. we review our estimates of rebates, chargebacks, and other applicable provisions each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period's net product sales. refer to the "results of operations - revenues - net product sales" section below for further details regarding our provisions, and credits/payments, for sales-related deductions.
collaborative arrangements we have entered into various collaborative arrangements to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms.
our collaboration agreements may require us to deliver various rights, services, and/or goods across the entire life cycle of a product or product candidate. in agreements involving multiple goods or services promised to be transferred to our collaborator, we must assess, at the inception of the contract, whether each promise represents a separate obligation (i.e., is "distinct"), or whether such promises should be combined as a single unit of account. when we have a combined unit of account which includes a license and providing research and development services to our collaborator, recognition of up-front payments and development milestones earned from our collaborator is deferred (as a liability) and recognized over the development period (i.e., over time). in arrangements where we satisfy our obligation(s) during the development phase over time, we recognize amounts initially deferred over time typically using an input method on the basis of our research and development costs incurred relative to the total expected cost which determines the extent of our progress toward completion. we review our estimates each period and make revisions to such estimates as necessary. due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, potential delays in development programs, changes to development plans and budgets as programs progress, including if we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to our estimates are likely to occur periodically and could result in material changes to amounts recognized each year in the future.
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the expenses (e.g., research and development expenses) that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts in the period in which such costs are incurred.
if both we and our collaborator perform development work or commercialization-related activities and share costs, we also recognize, as expense (i.e., research and development expense or selling, general and administrative expense, as applicable) in the period when our collaborator incurs such expenses, the portion of the collaborator's expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. our collaborators provide us with estimated expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. our collaborators' estimates are reconciled to their actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and our portion of our collaborators' expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted on a prospective basis accordingly, as necessary.
under certain of the company's collaboration agreements, product sales and cost of sales may be recorded by the company's collaborators as they are deemed to be the principal in the transaction. in arrangements where we:
•are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply commercial product to our collaborator, we may be reimbursed for our manufacturing costs as commercial product is shipped to the collaborator; however, recognition of such cost reimbursements is deferred until the product is sold by our collaborator to third-party customers;
•share in any profits or losses arising from the commercialization of such products, we record our share of the variable consideration, representing net product sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses, in the period in which such underlying sales occur and costs are incurred by the collaborator; and
•receive royalties and/or sales-based milestone payments from our collaborator, we recognize such amounts in the period earned.
our collaborators provide us with estimates of product sales and our share of profits or losses, as applicable, for such quarter. these estimates are reconciled to actual results in the subsequent fiscal quarter, and collaboration revenue is adjusted accordingly, as necessary.
stock-based compensation we recognize stock-based compensation expense for equity grants under our long-term incentive plans to employees and non-employee members of our board of directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. the grant-date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award's requisite service period.
we use the black-scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards. using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of our common stock price, (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on our common stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted u.s. treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options' expected lives. expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options' expected lives. expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of directors option grants. the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future.
stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which is made at the time of grant, of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. this estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
we use a monte carlo simulation to compute the estimated fair value of performance-based restricted stock units, which are subject to vesting based on the company's attainment of pre-established market performance goals.
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of equity awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of awards granted and the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in future periods.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns, including deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected amounts of global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") inclusions. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined as the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts ("temporary differences") at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we periodically re-assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, results of recent operations, and our historical earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction. significant judgment is required in making this assessment.
uncertain tax positions, for which management's assessment is that there is more than a 50% probability that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority based upon its technical merits, are subjected to certain recognition and measurement criteria. significant judgment is required in making this assessment, and, therefore, we re-evaluate uncertain tax positions and consider various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the uncertain positions.
inventories we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized; otherwise, such costs are expensed. the determination to capitalize inventory costs is based on various factors, including status and expectations of the regulatory approval process, any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions, and any other impediments to obtaining regulatory approval.
we periodically analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, and write-down such inventories as appropriate. in addition, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. if certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we record a charge to write down such unmarketable inventory to its estimated realizable value.
contingencies we accrue, based on management's judgment, for an estimated loss when the potential loss from claims or legal proceedings is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. as additional information becomes available, or, based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation, and may change our estimates.

* net product sales of praluent in the united states were recorded by sanofi prior to april 1, 2020
net product sales net product sales of eylea in the united states increased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to higher sales volume partly offset by an increase in sales-related deductions primarily due to higher rebates and discounts. net product sales of eylea in the united states were lower in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019, due to lower sales volume attributable to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. while we observed an increase in u.s. eylea demand during the remainder of 2020 relative to the second quarter of 2020, we are unable to predict whether there will be additional adverse impacts on net product sales from shelter-in-place, social distancing, and other similar measures due to the covid-19 pandemic (refer to part i, item 1a. "risk factors - our business may be further adversely affected by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic). refer also to part i, item 1a. "risk factors - sales of our marketed products are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition" for information and potential future risks concerning the mfn interim final rule issued by the hhs on medicare reimbursements for eylea.

(1) corresponding costs incurred by us in connection with such production is recorded within cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing antibody the increase in our share of profits in connection with commercialization of antibodies in 2020, compared to 2019, was driven by higher dupixent profits and, to a lesser extent, our new agreement with sanofi under which, effective april 1, 2020, we are no longer sharing in losses with sanofi in connection with the commercialization of praluent (see further information below).
during 2020, the company earned, and recognized as revenue, the first $50.0 million sales-based milestone from sanofi, upon aggregate annual sales of dupixent, kevzara, and praluent outside the united states exceeding $1.0 billion on a rolling twelve-month basis. we are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $200.0 million in additional milestone payments from sanofi, including the second sales milestone in the amount of $50.0 million, when such sales outside the united states exceed $1.5 billion on a rolling twelve-month basis.
the increase in reimbursements for manufacturing of commercial supplies in 2020, compared to 2019, was primarily due to higher dupixent sales, as revenue for such cost reimbursements is recognized when the product is sold by sanofi to third-party customers.
regeneron's share of profits (losses) in connection with the commercialization of dupixent, praluent (through march 31, 2020), and kevzara is summarized below:

research and development expenses the following table summarizes our estimates of direct research and development expenses by clinical development program and other significant categories of research and development expenses. direct research and development expenses are comprised primarily of costs paid to third parties for clinical and product development activities, including costs related to preclinical research activities, clinical trials, and the portion of research and development expenses incurred by our collaborators that we are obligated to reimburse. indirect research and development expenses have not been allocated directly to each program, and primarily consist of costs to compensate personnel, overhead and infrastructure costs to maintain our facilities, and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects. clinical manufacturing costs primarily consist of costs to manufacture bulk drug product for clinical development purposes as well as related external drug filling, packaging, and labeling costs. clinical manufacturing costs also includes pre-launch commercial supplies which did not meet the criteria to be capitalized as inventory (see "critical accounting policies and use of estimates - inventories" above). the table below also includes reimbursements of research and development expenses by collaborators, as when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of such expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts in the period in which such costs are incurred.

* certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation research and development expenses in 2020 included $85.0 million in aggregate up-front payments made in connection with our collaboration agreement with intellia. research and development expenses in 2019 included a $400.0 million up-front payment to alnylam. see part i, item 1. "collaboration, license, and other agreements" for further information. research and development expenses in 2020 also included costs in connection with investigating the use of regen-cov and kevzara for covid-19. research and development expenses included non-cash compensation expense of $238.6 million, $250.4 million, and $229.0 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in part i, item 1a. "risk factors" (including those relating to the disruptions caused by the covid-19 pandemic). there is also variability in the duration and costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product, potential opportunities and/or uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, and the estimated cost and scope of the projects. the lengthy process of seeking fda and other applicable approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business. we are unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows.
selling, general, and administrative expenses selling, general, and administrative expenses increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to higher headcount-related costs, an increase in commercialization-related expenses for eylea and libtayo, higher contributions to independent not-for-profit patient assistance organizations, and, effective april 1, 2020, no longer receiving praluent-related cost reimbursements from sanofi for regeneron-incurred expenses. these increases were largely offset by a reversal of accruals for litigation-related loss contingencies as a result of the october 2020 ruling by the technical board of appeal of the epo and its impact on certain patent infringement actions in europe relating to praluent (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). in addition, in 2019, we recorded a $35.2 million charge related to employee separation costs, as the company eliminated certain commercialization activities and related headcount in connection with the restructuring of the antibody agreement with sanofi (as described in part i, item 1. "business - collaboration, license, and other agreements - sanofi - antibody"). selling, general, and administrative expenses also included $153.0 million, $167.7 million, and $169.2 million of non-cash compensation expense in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the recognition of manufacturing costs in connection with the initiation of product sales of regen-cov (which commenced in the third quarter of 2020) and praluent in the united states (which were recorded by sanofi prior to april 1, 2020), as well as higher product sales of libtayo and eylea in the united states. these increases were partly offset by lower period costs for our limerick commercial manufacturing facility. in addition, cost of goods sold for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 included inventory write-downs and reserves totaling $39.2 million and $73.8 million, respectively.
cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing the increase in cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing in 2020, compared to 2019, was primarily due to the recognition of manufacturing costs associated with higher sales of dupixent and recognition of costs in connection with manufacturing ex-u.s. commercial supplies of praluent for sanofi. in addition, cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing increased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to process validation costs in connection with manufacturing inmazeb under our barda agreement.
other operating (income) expense other operating (income) expense, net, includes recognition of a portion of amounts previously deferred in connection with up-front and development milestone payments, as applicable, received in connection with sanofi io, teva, and mtpc collaborative arrangements. in these arrangements, we satisfy our obligation(s) during the development phase over time, and, as a result, recognize amounts initially deferred over time using an input method on the basis of our research and development costs incurred relative to the total expected cost which determines the extent of our progress toward completion. see the critical accounting policies and use of estimates section above for further details.
during 2020, we updated our estimate of the total research and development costs expected to be incurred (which resulted in changes to the estimate of the stage of completion) in connection with the aforementioned collaboration agreements, and therefore recorded cumulative catch-up adjustments of $99.8 million, net, as an increase to other operating income. during 2018, we updated our estimate of the total research and development costs expected to be incurred for the sanofi io collaboration, including in connection with the termination of the 2015 io discovery agreement, and, as result, a cumulative catch-up adjustment of $135.0 million was recorded as an increase to other operating income.
other income (expense)
other income (expense), net, in 2020, compared to 2019, was positively impacted by the recognition of unrealized and realized gains on marketable securities. other income (expense), net, in 2020, compared to 2019, was negatively impacted by a decrease in interest income earned on available-for-sale debt securities primarily due to lower interest rates. in addition, interest expense in 2020, compared to 2019, increased as a result of the 2020 bridge loan facility and issuance of senior notes (as described below).

our effective tax rate for 2020 was positively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily by stock-based compensation, and, to a lesser extent, federal tax credits for research activities and income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate. our effective tax rate for 2019 was positively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily by federal tax credits for research activities, stock-based compensation, and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. our effective tax rate for 2018 was positively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily by the sale of non-inventory related assets between foreign subsidiaries (for which we recorded a $162.1 million net income tax benefit), and, to a lesser extent, the federal tax credit for research activities, stock-based compensation, income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, and tax planning in connection with the bill known as the "tax cuts and jobs act". during 2018, we also recorded an income tax benefit of $68.0 million as a final adjustment to the provisional amount recorded as of december 31, 2017 in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act.

cash flows from operating activities
2020
our net income of $3.513 billion in 2020 included net unrealized gains on equity securities (included in other non-cash items) of $196.0 million. as of december 31, 2020, trade, sanofi, and other accounts receivables increased by $1.356 billion, compared to december 31, 2019, partly as a result of extending payment terms to certain of our eylea customers due to the covid-19 pandemic. inventories increased as of december 31, 2020, compared to december 31, 2019, partially as a result of purchasing additional raw materials in anticipation of potential disruptions to our supply chain due to the covid-19 pandemic. deferred taxes as of december 31, 2020 decreased by $75.6 million, compared to december 31, 2019, primarily due to non-cash compensation expense and unrealized gains (net) on equity securities as described above.
2019
our net income of $2.116 billion in 2019 was negatively impacted by an up-front payment of $400.0 million made to alnylam pursuant to our collaboration agreement. our net income in 2019 was impacted by several non-cash items, including unrealized gains (net) on equity securities and inventory write-downs and reserves (see "results of operations" above), as well as the impact of sanofi satisfying its libtayo development funding obligation in shares of regeneron stock (see "sanofi funding of certain development costs" below). deferred taxes as of december 31, 2019 increased by $130.6 million, compared to december 31, 2018, primarily due to the tax treatment of the up-front payment made to alnylam and non-cash compensation expense. other liabilities as of december 31, 2019 increased compared to december 31, 2018 partially due to the impact of the receipt of a $461.9 million payment from sanofi in connection with the termination of the 2015 io discovery agreement (as described in part i, item 1. "collaboration agreements - collaborations with sanofi - immuno-oncology").
2018
our net income of $2.444 billion in 2018 included the cumulative catch-up adjustments of $135.0 million recorded to other operating income primarily in connection with the termination of the 2015 io discovery agreement and other non-cash items, including $75.8 million in connection with sanofi satisfying its libtayo development funding obligation in shares of regeneron stock and $41.9 million related to unrealized losses (net) on equity securities. deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2018 increased by $140.0 million, compared to december 31, 2017, primarily due to the impact of the company's sale of non-inventory related assets between foreign subsidiaries.
cash flows from investing activities sales of marketable securities in 2020 included proceeds from such sales to fund a portion of our stock repurchase from sanofi (as described below). in 2019, we purchased $400.0 million of alnylam common stock in connection with entering into the collaboration agreement. capital expenditures in 2020 included costs associated with (i) the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, including construction of a fill/finish facility and related equipment, and (ii) laboratory expansion and renovations at our tarrytown, new york facilities. we expect to incur capital expenditures of $600 million to $680 million in 2021 primarily in connection with the continued expansion of our manufacturing facilities, including the fill/finish facility and equipment, and the expansion of our research facilities.
cash flows from financing activities during 2020, we purchased shares of our common stock from sanofi, a portion of which was funded with the proceeds from a $1.5 billion senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility. see additional information under "secondary offering and purchase of regeneron common stock held by sanofi" below. during 2020 and 2019, we also repurchased shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program (see "share repurchase program" below). during 2020, we issued and sold $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and used a portion of the net proceeds to repay in full the bridge loan facility. see additional information under "issuance of senior notes" below.
proceeds from issuances of common stock, in connection with exercises of employee stock options, were $2.575 billion during 2020, compared to $211.8 million during 2019 and $114.5 million during 2018.
credit facility in december 2018, we entered into an agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the "credit agreement") which provides for a $750.0 million senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "credit facility"), and contemporaneously terminated our then-existing credit agreement (the "prior credit agreement"). the credit agreement was entered into on terms substantially similar to those of the prior credit agreement. no borrowings were outstanding under the prior credit agreement at the time of its termination.
the credit agreement includes an option for us to elect to increase the commitments under the credit facility and/or to enter into one or more tranches of term loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million, subject to the consent of the lenders providing the additional commitments or term loans, as applicable, and certain other conditions. proceeds of the loans under the credit facility may be used to finance working capital needs, and for general corporate or other lawful purposes, of regeneron and its subsidiaries. the credit agreement also provides a $50.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. the credit agreement includes an option for us to elect to extend the maturity date of the credit facility beyond december 2023, subject to the consent of the extending lenders and certain other conditions. amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be prepaid, and the commitments under the credit facility may be terminated, at any time without premium or penalty. we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31, 2020.
the credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants. financial covenants include a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest expense coverage ratio. we were in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility as of december 31, 2020.
share repurchase program in november 2019, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. the share repurchase program permitted the company to effect repurchases through a variety of methods, including open-market transactions (including pursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with rule 10b5-1 of the exchange act), privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases, block trades, and other transactions in compliance with rule 10b-18 of the exchange act. during 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 1,605,582 and 722,596 shares of our common stock, respectively, under the program and recorded the cost of the shares received, or $746.0 million and $254.0 million, respectively, as treasury stock. as of december 31, 2020, the company had repurchased the entire $1.0 billion of its common stock that it was authorized to repurchase under the program.
in january 2021, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock. the share repurchase program was approved under terms substantially similar to the november 2019 share repurchase program described above.
sanofi funding of certain development costs as described in part i, item 1. "collaboration, license, and other agreements - sanofi," effective january 7, 2018, we agreed to allow sanofi to satisfy in whole or in part its funding obligations with respect to libtayo development and/or dupilumab/itepekimab eligible investments incurred in periods through september 30, 2020 by selling shares of our common stock directly or indirectly owned by sanofi. during 2020, sanofi elected to sell, and we elected to purchase (by issuing a credit towards the amount owed by sanofi), 77,677 shares of the company's common stock to satisfy sanofi's funding obligation related to libtayo development costs. consequently, we recorded $41.7 million related to the shares received as treasury stock during 2020. in addition, during 2020, sanofi elected to sell, and we elected to purchase (in cash), 171,471 shares of the company's common stock in connection with sanofi's funding obligation for dupilumab/itepekimab eligible investments. consequently, we recorded the cost of the shares received, or $93.3 million, as treasury stock during 2020.
secondary offering and purchase of regeneron common stock held by sanofi as described in part i, item 1. "collaboration, license, and other agreements - sanofi," in may 2020, a secondary offering of 13,014,646 shares of our common stock (the "secondary offering") held by sanofi was completed. in connection with the secondary offering, we also purchased 9,806,805 shares of our common stock directly from sanofi for an aggregate purchase amount of $5 billion (the "stock purchase"). as a result of the secondary offering and the stock purchase, sanofi disposed of all of its shares of our common stock, other than 400,000 shares that it retained as of the closing of the secondary offering and the stock purchase (which sanofi was able to use for the funding of certain libtayo development costs and/or dupilumab/itepekimab eligible investments as described above).
we funded the stock purchase with a combination of cash on hand, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, and proceeds from loans under a $1.5 billion senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility (the "bridge facility") which was entered into in may 2020. the loans under the bridge facility bore interest at a variable interest rate based on either libor or the alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin that varied with our debt rating and total leverage ratio. as described below, the bridge facility was repaid in august 2020 following the issuance and sale of the company's senior unsecured notes.
issuance of senior notes in august 2020, we issued and sold $1.250 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2030 (the "2030 notes") and $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2050 (the "2050 notes" and, together with the 2030 notes, the "notes"). net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes (after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses) were used in part to repay in full the bridge facility described above, including accrued interest and related fees and expenses in connection therewith.
the 2030 notes accrue interest at the rate of 1.750% per year and will mature on september 15, 2030. the 2050 notes accrue interest at the rate of 2.800% per year and will mature on september 15, 2050. interest on each series of notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year, commencing on march 15, 2021, until their respective maturity dates.
the notes may be redeemed at the company's option at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, and, until a specified period before maturity, a specified make-whole amount. the notes contain a change-of-control provision that, under certain circumstances, may require the company to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
the notes also contain certain limitations on the company's ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, as well as customary events of default.
tarrytown, new york leases we lease laboratory and office facilities in tarrytown, new york (the "facility"). in 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement with the then lessor, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase the facility for a purchase price of $720.0 million. in march 2017, we entered into a participation agreement with banc of america leasing & capital llc ("bal"), as lessor, and a syndicate of lenders (collectively, the "lease participants"), which provided for lease financing in connection with the acquisition by bal of the facility and our lease of the facility from bal. in march 2017, we assigned our right to take title to the facility under the purchase agreement to bal, and the lease participants advanced $720.0 million, which was used by bal to finance the purchase price for the facility.
concurrent with entering into the participation agreement, we also entered into a lease agreement (the "lease") for the facility with bal for a five-year term ending in march 2022. the lease requires us to pay all maintenance, insurance, taxes, and other costs arising out of the use of the facility. we are also required to make monthly payments of basic rent during the term of the lease in an amount equal to a variable rate per annum based on the one-month libor, plus an applicable margin that varies with our debt rating and total leverage ratio.
the participation agreement and the lease include an option for us to elect to extend the maturity date of the participation agreement and the term of the lease for an additional five-year period, subject to the consent of all the lease participants and certain other conditions. we also have the option prior to the end of the term of the lease to (a) purchase the facility by paying an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the lease participants' advances under the participation agreement, all accrued and unpaid interest and yield thereon, and all other outstanding amounts under the participation agreement, the lease, and certain related documents or (b) sell the facility to a third party on behalf of bal. the advances under the participation agreement mature, and all amounts outstanding thereunder will become due and payable in full at the end of the term of the lease.
the participation agreement and the lease contain financial and operating covenants, which are substantially similar to the covenants set forth in our credit facility. we were in compliance with all covenants of the participation agreement and the lease as of december 31, 2020.
funding requirements the amount required to fund operations will depend on various factors, including the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates and the timing thereof and the extent and cost of our research and development programs. we believe that our existing capital resources, borrowing availability under the credit facility, funds generated by anticipated product sales, and, as described above under part i, item 1. "collaboration, license, and other agreements," funding for reimbursement of research and development costs that we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements, will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs for the foreseeable future.

(1) primarily includes research and development commitments, including those related to clinical trials and capital expenditures. our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on relevant future events.
(2) includes rent payments with respect to finance lease obligations in connection with our property leases in tarrytown, new york, as described under "tarrytown, new york leases" above and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. amounts in the table above exclude the $720.0 million purchase price we would be obligated to pay if we were to exercise our option to purchase the facility.
(3) includes principal and interest for our 2030 notes and 2050 notes, as described under "issuance of senior notes" above liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, totaling $267.0 million at december 31, 2020, are not included in the table of contractual obligations above as, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the period of potential future cash settlement with taxing authorities. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
we expect continued increases in our expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities (including preclinical and clinical programs). the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial. under certain collaboration agreements, the amount of funding for reimbursement of research and development costs that we are entitled to receive is capped at a specified amount; therefore, we may elect to independently fund certain research and development costs in excess of such capped amounts.
clinical trial costs are dependent, among other things, on the size and duration of trials (for example, we have several ongoing late-stage clinical trials which are large and for which we expect to incur significant costs), fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials, and for supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses.
we expect to continue to incur substantial development and manufacturing costs for regen-cov in 2021. though the amount of funding that will be required will be subject to clinical data results, the duration of the covid-19 pandemic, and other factors, including regulatory outcomes, as described in part i, item 1. "agreements related to covid-19," we have entered into agreements with the u.s. government to purchase supplies of the drug product and with roche to fund certain of our development costs.
we anticipate continuing to incur substantial commercialization costs for eylea, dupixent, and libtayo. commercialization costs over the next few years will depend on, among other things, the market potential for product candidates, whether commercialization costs are shared with a collaborator, and regulatory approval of additional product candidates.
we expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will be substantial.
we enter into collaboration and licensing agreements that may require us to pay (i) amounts upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones, which, in the aggregate, could be significant, and/or (ii) royalties calculated based on a percentage of net product sales. the payment of these amounts, however, is contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring and for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. because of these factors, such payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations above. see note 3 and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.
under our collaboration with bayer for eylea outside the united states and our antibody and io collaborations with sanofi, we and our collaborator share profits and losses in connection with commercialization of drug products. profits or losses under each collaboration are measured by calculating net sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses. if the applicable collaboration is profitable, we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse bayer and sanofi for a defined percentage (generally 50%) of agreed-upon development expenses funded by bayer and sanofi and bayer (i.e., "development balance"). these reimbursements are deducted each quarter, in accordance with a formula, from our share of the collaboration profits (and, for our eylea collaboration with bayer, inclusive of our percentage on product sales in japan) otherwise payable to us, unless, in the case of eylea, we elect to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate. as of december 31, 2020, our contingent reimbursement obligation to bayer for eylea was approximately $276 million and our contingent reimbursement obligation to sanofi in connection with the companies' antibody collaboration and io collaboration was approximately $3.103 billion and $107 million, respectively. therefore, we expect that, for the foreseeable future, a portion of our share of profits from sales under our collaborations with bayer and sanofi will be used to reimburse our collaborators for these obligations.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
future impact of recently issued accounting standards as of december 31, 2020, the future adoption of recently issued accounting standards is not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.

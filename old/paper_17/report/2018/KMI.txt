item 1a.  risk factors.
you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this document. realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
risks related to operating our business our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle.
our pipelines, terminals and other assets and facilities depend in part on continued production of natural gas, oil and other products in the geographic areas that they serve. our business also depends in part on the levels of demand for natural gas, oil, ngl, refined petroleum products, co2, coal, steel, chemicals and other products in the geographic areas to which our pipelines, terminals, shipping vessels and other facilities deliver or provide service, and the ability and willingness of our shippers and other customers to supply such demand. for example, without additions to oil and gas reserves, production will decline over time as reserves are depleted, and production costs may rise. producers may reduce or shut down production during times of lower product prices or higher production costs to the extent they become uneconomic. producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves, and our pipelines and related facilities may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput. commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves, produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire.
changes in the business environment, such as declining or sustained low commodity prices, supply disruptions, or higher development or production costs, could result in a slowing of supply to our pipelines, terminals and other assets. in addition, changes in the overall demand for hydrocarbons, the regulatory environment or applicable governmental policies, including in relation to climate change or other environmental concerns, may have a negative impact on the supply of crude oil and other products. in recent years, a number of initiatives and regulatory changes relating to reducing ghg emissions have been undertaken by federal, provincial, state and municipal governments and oil and gas industry participants. in addition, emerging technologies and public opinion have resulted in increasing demand for energy efficiency, including energy provided from renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels and fuel-efficient alternatives such as hybrid and electric vehicles. these factors could result in not only increased costs for producers of hydrocarbons but also an overall decrease in the demand for hydrocarbons. each of the foregoing could negatively impact our business directly as well as our shippers and other customers, which in turn could negatively impact our prospects for new contracts for transportation, terminaling or other midstream services, or renewals of existing contracts or the ability of our customers and shippers to honor their contractual commitments. see "-financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us" below.
21
we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices, all of which could reduce the production of and/or demand for the products we handle. in addition, irrespective of supply of or demand for products we handle, implementation of new regulations or changes to existing regulations affecting the energy industry could have a material adverse effect on us. see "-the ferc, the cpuc, or the neb may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us. in addition, the ferc, the cpuc, the neb, or our customers could initiate proceedings or file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines, which could have an adverse impact on us."
expanding our existing assets and constructing new assets is part of our growth strategy. our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion and new-build projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining, or our inability to obtain, permits and rights-of-way, as well as public opposition, increases in costs of construction materials, cost overruns, inclement weather and other delays. should we pursue expansion of or construction of new projects through joint ventures with others, we will share control and benefits from those projects.
we regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets and to construct new assets. new growth projects generally will be subject to, among other things, the receipt of regulatory approvals, feasibility and cost analyses, funding availability and industry, market and demand conditions. if we pursue joint ventures with third parties, those parties may share approval rights over major decisions, and may act in their own interests. their views may differ from our own or our views of the interests of the venture which could result in operational delays or impasses, which in turn could affect the financial expectations of and our benefits from the venture. a variety of factors outside of our control, such as difficulties in obtaining permits and rights-of-way or other regulatory approvals, have caused, and may continue to cause, delays in or cancellations of our construction projects. regulatory authorities may modify their permitting policies in ways that disadvantage our construction projects, such as the ferc's consideration of changes to its certificate policy statement. such factors can be exacerbated by public opposition to our projects. see "-we are subject to reputational risks and risks related to public opinion." for example, changing public attitudes toward pipelines bearing fossil fuels may impede our ability to secure rights of way or governmental reviews and authorizations on a timely basis or at all. inclement weather, natural disasters and delays in performance by third-party contractors have also resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs or delays in construction. significant increases in costs of construction materials, cost overruns or delays, or our inability to obtain a required permit or right-of-way, could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment, results of operations and cash flows, and could result in project cancellations or limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities.
we face competition from other pipelines and terminals, as well as other forms of transportation and storage.
any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation (such as barge, rail or truck) that delivers the products we handle into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price, location, facilities or other factors. likewise, competing terminals or other storage options may become more attractive to our customers. to the extent that competitors offer the markets we serve more desirable transportation or storage options, this could result in unused capacity on our pipelines and in our terminals. we also could experience competition for the supply of the products we handle from both existing and proposed pipeline systems; for example, several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us. if capacity on our assets remains unused, our ability to re-contract for expiring capacity at favorable rates or otherwise retain existing customers could be impaired.
the volatility of oil, ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co2 business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments.
the revenues, cash flows, profitability and future growth of some of our businesses depend to a large degree on prevailing oil, ngl and natural gas prices. our co2 business segment (and the carrying value of its oil, ngl and natural gas producing properties) and certain midstream businesses within our natural gas pipelines business segment depend to a large degree, and certain businesses within our product pipelines business segment depend to a lesser degree, on prevailing oil, ngl and natural gas prices. for 2019, we estimate that every $1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our dcf by approximately $8 million, each $0.10 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas would impact dcf by approximately $1 million, and each 1% change in the ratio of the weighted-average ngl price per barrel to the wti crude oil price per barrel would impact dcf by approximately $3 million.
prices for oil, ngl and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, ngl and natural gas, uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond our control. these factors include, among other things (i) weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the u.s.; (ii) domestic and global economic conditions; (iii) the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries; (iv) governmental
22
regulation; (v) political instability in oil producing countries; (vi) the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; (vii) the price of foreign imports; (viii) the proximity and availability of storage and transportation infrastructure and processing and treating facilities; and (ix) the availability and prices of alternative fuel sources. we use hedging arrangements to partially mitigate our exposure to commodity prices, but these arrangements also are subject to inherent risks. please read "-our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income."
a sharp decline in the prices of oil, ngl or natural gas, or a prolonged unfavorable price environment, would result in a commensurate reduction in our revenues, income and cash flows from our businesses that produce, process, or purchase and sell oil, ngl, or natural gas, and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of our co2 business segment's proved reserves. if prices fall substantially or remain low for a sustained period and we are not sufficiently protected through hedging arrangements, we may be unable to realize a profit from these businesses and would operate at a loss.
in recent decades, there have been periods worldwide of both overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons, and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts. such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of, and reduced demand for, crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis. these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of, and increased demand for, crude oil and natural gas. the cycles of excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas have placed pressures on prices and resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand. these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process. for more information about our energy and commodity market risk, see item 7a "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-energy commodity market risk."
commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to the transportation and storage of the products we handle, such as leaks; releases; the breakdown, underperformance or failure of equipment, facilities, information systems or processes; damage to our pipelines caused by third-party construction; the compromise of information and control systems; spills at terminals and hubs; spills associated with the loading and unloading of harmful substances at rail facilities; adverse sea conditions (including storms and rising sea levels) and releases or spills from our shipping vessels or vessels loaded at our marine terminals; operator error; labor disputes/work stoppages; disputes with interconnected facilities and carriers; operational disruptions or apportionment on third-party systems or refineries on which our assets depend; and catastrophic events such as natural disasters, fires, floods, explosions, earthquakes, acts of terrorists and saboteurs, cyber security breaches, and other similar events, many of which are beyond our control. additional risks to our vessels include capsizing, grounding and navigation errors.
the occurrence of any of these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life, significant damage to property and natural resources, environmental pollution, significant reputational damage, impairment or suspension of operations, fines or other regulatory penalties, and revocation of regulatory approvals or imposition of new requirements, any of which also could result in substantial financial losses, including lost revenue and cash flow to the extent that an incident causes an interruption of service. for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater. in addition, the consequences of any operational incident (including as a result of adverse sea conditions) at one of our marine terminals may be even more significant as a result of the complexities involved in addressing leaks and releases occurring in the ocean or along coastlines and/or the repair of marine terminals.
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions.
unfavorable economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries, including the oil and gas industry, the steel industry, the coal industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services. in addition, uncertain or changing economic conditions within one or more geographic regions may affect our operating results within the affected regions. volatility in commodity prices or changes in markets for a given commodity might also have a negative impact on many of our customers, which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us. see "-financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us." in addition, decreases in the prices of crude oil, ngl and natural gas will have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow. see "-the volatility of oil, ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co2 business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments."
23
if economic and market conditions (including volatility in commodity markets) globally, in the u.s. or in other key markets become more volatile or deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us.
we are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers or other counterparties, such as hedging counterparties, joint venture partners and suppliers. many of our counterparties finance their activities through cash flow from operations or debt or equity financing, and some of them may be highly leveraged. our counterparties are subject to their own operating, market, financial and regulatory risks, and some are experiencing, or may experience in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. for example, pg&e, a customer of ruby, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in january 2019. see item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-general-investment in ruby." further, the security that is permitted to be obtained from such customers may be limited by ferc regulation. while certain of our customers are subsidiaries of an entity that has an investment grade credit rating, in many cases the parent entity has not guaranteed the obligations of the subsidiary and, therefore, the parent's credit ratings may have no bearing on such customers' ability to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us. furthermore, financially distressed customers might be forced to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services, which also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
we cannot provide any assurance that such customers and key counterparties will not become financially distressed or that such financially distressed customers or counterparties will not default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy protection. if one of such customers or counterparties files for bankruptcy protection, we likely would be unable to collect all, or even a significant portion, of amounts owed to us. significant customer and other counterparty defaults and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
the acquisition of additional businesses and assets is part of our growth strategy. we may experience difficulties completing acquisitions or integrating new businesses and properties, and we may be unable to achieve the benefits we expect from any future acquisitions.
part of our business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses and assets. we evaluate and pursue assets and businesses that we believe will complement or expand our operations in accordance with our growth strategy. we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to complete acquisitions in the future or achieve the desired results from any acquisitions we do complete. any acquired business or assets will be subject to many of the same risks as our existing businesses and may not achieve the levels of performance that we anticipate.
if we do not successfully integrate acquisitions, we may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings. integration of acquired companies or assets involves a number of risks, including (i) the loss of key customers of the acquired business; (ii) demands on management related to the increase in our size; (iii) the diversion of management's attention from the management of daily operations; (iv) difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting, budgeting, reporting, internal controls and other systems; and (v) difficulties in the retention and assimilation of necessary employees.
we may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately. successful integration of each acquisition will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs. difficulties in integration may be magnified if we make multiple acquisitions over a relatively short period of time. because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations, we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other size-related benefits that we hoped to achieve after these acquisitions, which would harm our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion.
our business, operations or financial condition generally may be negatively impacted as a result of negative public opinion. public opinion may be influenced by negative portrayals of the industry in which we operate as well as opposition to development projects. in addition, market events specific to us could result in the deterioration of our reputation with key stakeholders. potential impacts of negative public opinion or reputational issues may include delays or stoppages in expansion projects, legal or regulatory actions or challenges, blockades, increased regulatory oversight, reduced support from regulatory

authorities, challenges to regulatory approvals, difficulty securing financing for and cost overruns affecting expansion projects and the degradation of our business generally.
reputational risk cannot be managed in isolation from other forms of risk. credit, market, operational, insurance, regulatory and legal risks, among others, must all be managed effectively to safeguard our reputation. our reputation and public opinion could also be impacted by the actions and activities of other companies operating in the energy industry, particularly other energy infrastructure providers, over which we have no control. in particular, our reputation could be impacted by negative publicity related to pipeline incidents or unpopular expansion projects and due to opposition to development of hydrocarbons and energy infrastructure, particularly projects involving resources that are considered to increase ghg emissions and contribute to climate change. negative impacts from a compromised reputation or changes in public opinion (including with respect to the production, transportation and use of hydrocarbons generally) could include revenue loss, reduction in customer base, delays in obtaining, or challenges to, regulatory approvals with respect to growth projects and decreased value of our securities and our business.
the future success of our oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. without successful development activities, the reserves, revenues and cash flows of the oil and gas producing assets within our co2 business segment will decline. we may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future. additionally, if we do not realize production volumes greater than, or equal to, our hedged volumes, we may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions.
the development of crude oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment.
the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that, while they may be reasonable, are by their nature speculative. it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well. furthermore, the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment. a variety of geological, operational and market-related factors, including, but not limited to, unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, equipment failures or accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering, pollution and other environmental risks, shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment, loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions, may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable. a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered, which impair or prevent the production of oil and/or gas from the well. in addition, production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances.
our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income.
we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and ngl. these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when production is less than expected, when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations, or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received. in addition, these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for crude oil and natural gas.
the markets for instruments we use to hedge our commodity price exposure generally reflect then-prevailing conditions in the underlying commodity markets. as our existing hedges expire, we will seek to replace them with new hedging arrangements. to the extent underlying market conditions are unfavorable, new hedging arrangements available to us will reflect such unfavorable conditions.
the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex, and even when we engage in hedging transactions (for example, to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity price or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates) that are effective economically, these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes. accordingly, our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges, even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements. in addition, it may not be possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely eliminate our exposure to commodity prices; therefore, our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter
25
into a completely effective hedge. for more information about our hedging activities, see item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies and estimates-hedging activities" and note 14 "risk management" to our consolidated financial statements.
a breach of information security or failure of one or more key information technology or operational (it) systems, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our business, results of operations or business reputation.
our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. the various uses of these it systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to, controlling our pipelines and terminals with industrial control systems, collecting and storing information and data, processing transactions, and handling other processing necessary to manage our business.
if any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. a significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption in our systems could result in a disruption of our operations, customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues. efforts by us and our vendors to develop, implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, and any network and information systems-related events could require us to expend significant resources to remedy such event. in the future, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.
attacks, including acts of terrorism or cyber sabotage, or the threat of such attacks, may adversely affect our business or reputation.
the u.s. government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other infrastructure assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or "cyber sabotage" events. for example, in 2018, a cyberattack on a shared data network forced four u.s. natural gas pipeline operators to temporarily shut down computer communications with their customers. potential targets include our pipeline systems, terminals, processing plants or operating systems. the occurrence of an attack could cause a substantial decrease in revenues and cash flows, increased costs to respond or other financial loss, damage to our reputation, increased regulation or litigation or inaccurate information reported from our operations. there is no assurance that adequate cyber sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future. these developments may subject our operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs, and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could harm our business reputation.
hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding and other natural disasters, as well as subsidence and coastal erosion, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
some of our pipelines, terminals and other assets are located in, and our shipping vessels operate in, areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding and other natural disasters or could be impacted by subsidence and coastal erosion. these natural disasters and phenomena could potentially damage or destroy our assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport. in the third quarter of 2017, hurricane harvey caused disruptions in our operations and damage to our assets near the texas gulf coast requiring approximately $45 million in repair costs, approximately $10 million of which was not recoverable through insurance. for more information regarding the impact of hurricane harvey on our assets and operating results, see item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels, increased intensity of weather, and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding. these climate-related changes could damage physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone and rain-susceptible regions. in addition, we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather. natural disasters and phenomena can similarly affect the facilities of our customers. in either case, losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. see items 1 and 2 "business and properties-(c) narrative description of business-environmental matters."
26
substantially all of the land on which our pipelines are located is owned by third parties. if we are unable to procure and maintain access to land owned by third parties, our revenue and operating costs, and our ability to complete construction projects, could be adversely affected.
we must obtain and maintain the rights to construct and operate pipelines on other owners' land, including private landowners, railroads, public utilities and others. while our interstate natural gas pipelines in the u.s. have federal eminent domain authority, the availability of eminent domain authority for our other pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipeline-petroleum liquids, natural gas, co2, or crude oil-and the laws of the particular state. in any case, we must compensate landowners for the use of their property, and in eminent domain actions, such compensation may be determined by a court. if we are unable to obtain rights-of-way on acceptable terms, our ability to complete construction projects on time, on budget, or at all, could be adversely affected. in addition, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our right-of-way or rental agreements with landowners, primarily through renewals of expiring agreements and rental increases. if we were to lose these rights, our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to relocate the affected pipelines, which could cause a substantial decrease in our revenues and cash flows and a substantial increase in our costs.
our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce, and difficulties recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans.
our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce, including engineers, technical personnel and other professionals. we and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce. in addition, many of our current employees are retirement eligible and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees. if we are unable to (i) retain current employees; (ii) successfully complete the knowledge transfer; and/or (iii) recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience, our business could be negatively impacted. in addition, we could experience increased costs to retain and recruit these professionals.
the increased financial reporting and other obligations of management resulting from kml's obligations as a public company may divert management's attention away from other business operations.
kml, in which we own an approximate 70% interest, completed its ipo in canada in may of 2017 and in 2018, completed the sale of its interest in the tmpl as described under item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-general-kml-sale of trans mountain pipeline system and its expansion project." certain of our officers and directors also serve as officers and directors of kml, and we provide financial reporting support and other services as requested by kml and its controlled affiliates pursuant to a services agreement. the increased obligations associated with providing support to kml as a public company may divert our management's attention from other business concerns and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are subject to financial reporting and other obligations that place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, legal, internal audit and accounting resources. the demands on our personnel related to kml's obligations as a public company will be intensified as a result of the management and personnel departures and related transition following the sale of our interest in the tmpl.
if we are unable to retain our executive officers, our ability to execute our business strategy, including our growth strategy, may be hindered.
our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers, particularly richard d. kinder, our executive chairman and one of our founders, steve kean, our chief executive officer, and kim dang, our president. along with the other members of our senior management, mssrs. kinder and kean and ms. dang have been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy. if we are not successful in retaining mr. kinder, mr. kean, ms. dang or our other executive officers, or replacing them, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. we do not maintain key personnel insurance.
our terminals business segment is subject to u.s. dollar/canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations as a result of operations in canada.
we are a u.s. dollar reporting company. as a result of the operations of our terminals business segment in canada, a portion of our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenues, cash flows and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars. fluctuations in the exchange rate between u.s. and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the u.s. dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our stockholders' equity under applicable accounting rules.
27
our insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs or liabilities that we may experience, and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums.
our insurance program may not cover all operational risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim. we do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
changes in the insurance markets subsequent to certain hurricanes and natural disasters have made it more difficult and more expensive to obtain certain types of coverage. the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance, or failure by one or more of our insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. insurance companies may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to offer or may demand significantly higher premiums or deductibles to cover our assets. if significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur, we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost. there is no assurance that our insurers will renew their insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of non-renewal. the unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
risks related to financing our business our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.
as of december 31, 2018, we had approximately $36.6 billion of consolidated debt (excluding debt fair value adjustments). additionally, we and substantially all of our wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries are parties to a cross guarantee agreement under which each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees the indebtedness of each other party, which means that we are liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries. this level of consolidated debt and the cross guarantee agreement could have important consequences, such as (i) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or potential growth, or for other purposes; (ii) increasing the cost of our future borrowings; (iii) limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt; (iv) placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt; and (v) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.
our ability to service our consolidated debt, and our ability to meet our consolidated leverage targets, will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. if our consolidated cash flow is not sufficient to service our consolidated debt, and any future indebtedness that we incur, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital. we may also take such actions to reduce our indebtedness if we determine that our earnings (or consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or ebitda, as calculated in accordance with our revolving credit facility) may not be sufficient to meet our consolidated leverage targets, or to comply with consolidated leverage ratios required under certain of our debt agreements. we may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all. for more information about our debt, see note 9 "debt" to our consolidated financial statements.
our business, financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit.
adverse changes to the availability, terms and cost of capital, interest rates or our credit ratings (which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to the cross guarantee agreement) could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital, including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms, which could in turn reduce our cash flows and limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities. our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage, liquidity, credit profile and potential transactions. although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities, our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries' debt securities and the terms available to us for future issuances of debt securities.
28
also, disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability, impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms. a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates.
as of december 31, 2018, approximately $11.4 billion of our approximately $36.6 billion of consolidated debt (excluding debt fair value adjustments) was subject to variable interest rates, either as short-term or long-term variable-rate debt obligations, or as long-term fixed-rate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps. should interest rates increase, the amount of cash required to service variable-rate debt would increase, as would our costs to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness, and our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected. for more information about our interest rate risk, see item 7a "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-interest rate risk."
acquisitions and growth capital expenditures may require access to external capital. limitations on our access to external financing sources could impair our ability to grow.
we have limited amounts of internally generated cash flows to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. if our internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to fund one or more capital projects or acquisitions, we may have to rely on external financing sources, including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. limitations on our access to external financing sources, whether due to tightened capital markets, more expensive capital or otherwise, could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.
our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs.
the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that may be beneficial to us. some of the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on (i) incurring additional debt; (ii) entering into mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; (iii) granting liens; and (iv) entering into sale-leaseback transactions. the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more limiting restrictions. our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be restricted.
our and our customer's access to capital could be affected by evolving financial institutions' policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels.
our and our customer's access to capital could be affected by evolving financial institutions' policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels. public opinion toward industries linked to fossil fuels continues to evolve. concerns about the potential effects of climate change have caused some to direct their attention towards sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in energy-related activities. ultimately, this could make it more difficult for our customers to secure funding for exploration and production activities, and consequently could both indirectly affect demand for our services and directly affect our ability to fund construction or other capital projects.
risks related to ownership of our capital stock the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates. circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business.
we disclose in this report and elsewhere the expected cash dividends on our common stock. these reflect our current judgment, but as with any estimate, they may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. see "information regarding forward-looking statements" at the beginning of this report. if our board of directors elects to pay dividends at the anticipated level and that action would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely advantage of growth opportunities (including through acquisitions), to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements, to fund our operations, to maintain our leverage metrics or otherwise to address properly our business prospects, our business could be harmed.
29
conversely, a decision to address such needs might lead to the payment of dividends below the anticipated levels. as events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable, our board of directors, which determines our business strategy and our dividends, may decide to address those matters by reducing our anticipated dividends. alternatively, because nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends, we could choose to incur debt to enable us to pay our anticipated dividends. this would add to our substantial debt discussed above under "-risks related to financing our business-our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions."
our certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership of our common stock by non-u.s. citizens within the meaning of the jones act. these restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in non-u.s. citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss.
the jones act requires, among other things, that at least 75% of our common stock be owned at all times by u.s. citizens, as defined under the jones act, in order for us to own and operate vessels in the u.s. coastwise trade. as a safeguard to help us maintain our status as a u.s. citizen, our certificate of incorporation provides that, if the number of shares of our common stock owned by non-u.s. citizens exceeds 22%, we have the ability to redeem shares owned by non-u.s. citizens to reduce the percentage of shares owned by non-u.s. citizens to 22%. these redemption provisions may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock, particularly in markets outside of the u.s. further, those stockholders would not have control over the timing of such redemption, and may be subject to redemption at a time when the market price or timing of the redemption is disadvantageous. in addition, the redemption provisions might have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger, tender offer or proxy contest by a non-u.s. citizen, even if it were favorable to the interests of some or all of our stockholders.
risks related to regulation the ferc, the cpuc, or the neb may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us. in addition, the ferc, the cpuc, the neb, or our customers could initiate proceedings or file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines, which could have an adverse impact on us.
the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers. to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc, the cpuc, or the neb to recover in our rates, or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file for and obtain rate increases, such events can have a negative impact on our operating results.
our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint. regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge, and have challenged, the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations. some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates. further, the ferc may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have over-collected on rates charged to shippers. we may face challenges, similar to those described in note 18 "litigation, environmental and other contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements, to the rates we charge on our pipelines. in addition, following the 2017 tax reform, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the ferc initiated the form 501-g process to review the estimated impact of the 2017 tax reform on interstate pipelines with respect to tax recovery in existing jurisdictional rates. see note 18 "litigation, environmental and other contingencies-ferc proceedings" to our consolidated financial statements. any successful challenge to our rates could materially adversely affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
new laws, policies, regulations, rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations.
our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal, state, provincial and local regulatory authorities. legislative changes, as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. in addition, a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the current u.s. presidential administration because it remains unclear specifically what the current administration may do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us. regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as (i) federal, state, provincial and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, reservation, commodity, surcharges, fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for), operating terms and conditions of service; (iii) the types of services we may offer to our customers; (iv) the contracts for service entered into with our customers; (v) the certification and construction of new facilities; (vi) the costs of raw materials, such as steel, which may be affected by tariffs or otherwise; (vii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (viii) the acquisition of other businesses; (ix) the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of services
30
or facilities; (x) reporting and information posting requirements; (xi) the maintenance of accounts and records; and (xii) relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the energy businesses.
should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and orders of regulatory authorities, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines and potential loss of government contracts. furthermore, new laws, regulations or policy changes sometimes arise from unexpected sources. new laws or regulations, unexpected policy changes or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, such as the 2017 tax reform and the resulting form 501-g process initiated by ferc, applicable to our income, operations, assets or another aspect of our business, could have a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. for more information, see items 1 and 2 "business and properties-(c) narrative description of business-regulation."
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities.
our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations, and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla, the resource conservation and recovery act, the federal clean water act, the oil pollution act or analogous state or provincial laws as a result of the presence or release of hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances into or through the environment, and these laws may require response actions and remediation and may impose liability for natural resource and other damages. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs and/or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us.
failure to comply with these laws and regulations including required permits and other approvals also may expose us to civil, criminal and administrative fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could harm our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. for example, if an accidental leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, shipping vessels or storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak, release or spill, pay government penalties, address natural resource damage, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures. the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our earnings and cash flows.
we own and/or operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities. while we believe we have utilized operating, handling, and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time, hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned, operated or used by us or our predecessors, or at or from properties where our or our predecessors' wastes have been taken for disposal. in addition, many of these properties have been owned and/or operated by third parties whose management, handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control. these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the u.s. such as cercla, which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. under the regulatory schemes of the various canadian provinces, such as british columbia's environmental management act, canada has similar laws with respect to properties owned, operated or used by us or our predecessors. under such laws and implementing regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, including contamination caused by prior owners or operators. imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position.
further, we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. for example, the federal clean air act and other similar federal, state and provincial laws are subject to periodic review and amendment, which could result in more stringent emission control requirements obligating us to make significant capital expenditures at our facilities.  there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. for more information, see items 1 and 2 "business and properties-(c) narrative description of business-environmental matters."
31
increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply.
we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity at the federal, state and provincial level. there are, for example, federal guidelines issued by the u.s. department of transportation (dot) for pipeline companies in the areas of testing, education, training and communication. the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict. the majority of compliance costs relate to pipeline integrity testing and repairs. technological advances in in-line inspection tools, identification of additional threats to a pipeline's integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in "high consequence areas" can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs. we plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the dot rules. the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines.
further, additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures. there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.
climate change and related regulation could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us and could reduce demand for our products and services.
various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of ghgs such as methane and co2, including the epa programs to control ghg emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs. existing epa regulations require us to report ghg emissions in the u.s. from sources such as our larger natural gas compressor stations, fractionated ngl, and production of naturally occurring co2 (for example, from our mcelmo dome co2 field), even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere. proposed approaches to further regulate ghg emissions include establishing ghg "cap and trade" programs, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for pollution reduction, use of renewable energy sources, or use of alternative fuels with lower carbon content. for more information about climate change regulation, see items 1 and 2 "business and properties-(c) narrative description of business-environmental matters-climate change."
adoption of any such laws or regulations could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances for our ghg emissions, pay taxes related to our ghg emissions and administer and manage a ghg emissions program, and such increased costs could be significant. recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc. such laws or regulations could also lead to reduced demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to ghgs, or restrictions on their use, which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services.
finally, many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events, which may lead to higher insurance costs, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather. these climate-related changes could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone and rain-susceptible regions.
any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
increased regulation of exploration and production activities, including hydraulic fracturing, could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, as well as reductions in production from existing wells, which could adversely impact the volumes of natural gas transported on our natural gas pipelines and our own oil and gas development and production activities.
we gather, process or transport crude oil, natural gas or ngl from several areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent. oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control. the oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on supplies of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources, such as shale, tight sands and coal bed methane. the extraction of hydrocarbons from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing. hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized

injection of water, sand, and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells. there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing. adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators, which could reduce their production of crude oil, natural gas or ngl and, in turn, adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of these commodities that we handle.
in addition, many states are promulgating stricter requirements not only for wells but also compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector. these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation. specifically, these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling, restrictions on drilling activities and location, emissions into the environment, water discharges, transportation of hazardous materials, and storage and disposition of wastes. in addition, legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities. these laws and regulations may adversely affect our oil and gas development and production activities.
derivatives regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.
the dodd-frank act requires the u.s. commodity futures trading commission (cftc) and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. those rules and regulations are largely complete; although in december 2016, the cftc re-proposed new rules pursuant to the dodd-frank act that would institute broad new aggregate position limits for otc swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges. thus, we cannot predict how further rules and regulations will affect us.
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
the jones act includes restrictions on ownership by non-u.s. citizens of our u.s. point to point maritime shipping vessels, and failure to comply with the jones act, or changes to or a repeal of the jones act, could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the u.s. coastwise trade, result in the forfeiture of our vessels or otherwise adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations.
we are subject to the jones act, which generally restricts u.s. point-to-point maritime shipping to vessels operating under the u.s. flag, built in the u.s., owned and operated by u.s.-organized companies that are controlled and at least 75% owned by u.s. citizens and crewed by predominately u.s. citizens. our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade. if we do not comply with any of these requirements, we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the u.s. coastwise trade and, under certain circumstances, we could be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved transfer to non-u.s. citizens that could result in severe penalties, including permanent loss of u.s. coastwise trading rights for our vessels, fines or forfeiture of vessels. our business could be adversely affected if the jones act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same u.s. government imposed burdens.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.  we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. additional sections in this report which should be helpful to the reading of our discussion and analysis include the following: (i) a description of our business strategy found in items 1 and 2 "business and properties-(c) narrative description of business-business strategy;" (ii) a description of developments during 2018, found in items 1 and 2 "business and properties-(a) general development of business-recent developments;" and (iii) a description of risk factors affecting us and our business, found in item 1a "risk factors."
inasmuch as the discussion below and the other sections to which we have referred you pertain to management's comments on financial resources, capital spending, our business strategy and the outlook for our business, such discussions contain forward-looking statements.  these forward-looking statements reflect the expectations, beliefs, plans and objectives of management about future financial performance and assumptions underlying management's judgment concerning the matters discussed, and accordingly, involve estimates, assumptions, judgments and uncertainties.  our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.  factors that could cause or contribute to any differences
35
include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in item 1a "risk factors" and at the beginning of this report in "information regarding forward-looking statements."
general our reportable business segments are:
•   natural gas pipelines-the ownership and operation of (i) major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems; (ii) natural gas and crude oil gathering systems and natural gas processing and treating facilities; (iii) ngl fractionation facilities and transportation systems; and (iv) lng facilities;
•   products pipelines-the ownership and operation of refined petroleum products, ngl and crude oil and condensate pipelines that primarily deliver, among other products, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, propane, ethane, crude oil and condensate to various markets, plus the ownership and/or operation of associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities;
•   terminals-the ownership and/or operation of (i) liquids and bulk terminal facilities located throughout the u.s. and portions of canada that transload and store refined petroleum products, crude oil, ethanol and chemicals, and bulk products, including petroleum coke, metals and ores; and (ii) jones act tankers;
•   co2-(i) the production, transportation and marketing of co2 to oil fields that use co2 as a flooding medium to increase recovery and production of crude oil from mature oil fields; (ii) ownership interests in and/or operation of oil fields and gasoline processing plants in west texas; and (iii) the ownership and operation of a crude oil pipeline system in west texas; and
•   kinder morgan canada (prior to august 31, 2018)-the ownership and operation of the trans mountain pipeline system that transports crude oil and refined petroleum products from edmonton, alberta, canada to marketing terminals and refineries in british columbia, canada and the state of washington. as a result of the tmpl sale, this segment does not have results of operations on a prospective basis.
as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various u.s. and canadian energy industries and markets, we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future.
with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines, related storage facilities and lng terminals, the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time.  to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors, we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms, with higher per-unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity.  these long-term contracts are typically structured with a fixed fee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available, whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity.  similarly, the texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations, currently derives approximately 76% of its sales and transport margins from long-term transport and sales contracts.  as contracts expire, we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas.  as of december 31, 2018, the remaining weighted average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts (including intrastate pipelines' sales portfolio) was approximately six years.
our midstream assets provide gathering and processing services for natural gas and gathering services for crude oil. these assets are mostly fee-based and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas, processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream, and fractionating ngl into their base components, are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems. such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity. in addition to fee based arrangements, some of which may include minimum volume commitments, we also provide some services based on percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-index and keep-whole contracts. our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement, but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above, which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices.
the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation and storage business generally is driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services. we also have approximately 55 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biofuels. the transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being
36
shipped or stored.  demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth, and, with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions, demand tends to be relatively stable.  because of that, we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in, or that transport to, stable or growing markets and population centers.  the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the u.s. producer price index.
our crude and condensate transportation services are primarily provided either pursuant to (i) long-term contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments or (ii) through terms prescribed by the toll settlements with shippers and approved by regulatory authorities. as a result of these contracts, our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term; however, in the longer term the revenues and earnings we realize from our crude oil and condensate pipelines are affected by the volumes of crude oil and condensate available to our pipeline systems, which are impacted by the level of oil and gas drilling activity in the respective producing regions that we serve. our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components, such as light and heavy naphtha, under a long-term fee-based agreement with a major integrated oil company.
the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ between liquid and bulk terminals, and in the case of a bulk terminal, the type of product being handled or stored.  our liquids terminals business generally has long-term contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity.  thus, similar to our natural gas pipelines business, our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to short-term changes in supply and demand.  therefore, the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts (which on average is approximately four years), the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported, and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time.  as with our refined petroleum products pipelines transportation business, the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle and/or store, as well as the prices we receive for our services, which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored.  while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals, the primary products are petroleum coke, metals and ores. for the most part, we have contracts for this business that contain minimum volume guarantees and/or service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs.  the profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by short-term variation in economic conditions; however, to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum and/or have contracts which are volume-based, we can be sensitive to changing market conditions.  to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors, we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms, with higher per-unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity.  in addition, weather-related factors such as hurricanes and other weather related events may impact our facilities and access to them and, thus, the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or, in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities, for longer periods. in addition to liquid and bulk terminals, we also own jones act tankers in our terminals business segment. as of december 31, 2018, we have sixteen jones act qualified tankers that operate in the marine transportation of crude oil, condensate and refined products in the u.s. and are currently operating pursuant to multi-year fixed price charters with major integrated oil companies, major refiners and the u.s. military sealift command.
the co2 source and transportation business primarily has third-party contracts with minimum volume requirements, which as of december 31, 2018, had a remaining average contract life of approximately nine years.  co2 sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed.  our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil, but with a floor price.  on a volume-weighted basis, for third-party contracts making deliveries in 2019, and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2019 budget, approximately 97% of our revenue is based on a fixed fee or floor price, and 3% fluctuates with the price of oil. in the long-term, our success in this portion of the co2 business segment is driven by the demand for co2. however, short-term changes in the demand for co2 typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts.  in the co2 business segment's oil and gas producing activities, we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add.  in that regard, our production during any period is an important measure.  in addition, the revenues we receive from our crude oil and ngl sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products.  over the long-term, we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products.  in the shorter term, however, market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management, or hedging, program, in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed, capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts, particularly for crude oil.  the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel, with the hedges allocated to oil, was $57.83 per barrel in 2018, $58.40 per barrel in 2017 and $61.52 per barrel in 2016.  had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk, our crude oil sales prices would have averaged $58.63 per barrel in 2018, $49.61 per barrel in 2017 and $41.36 per barrel in 2016.

investment in ruby in january 2019, pacific gas and electric (pg&e) filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  our exposure to pg&e is limited to our $750 million equity investment in ruby and an approximate $55 million note receivable from ruby, where pg&e is ruby's largest customer.  pg&e represents approximately $93 million of annual revenues on ruby, and our partner's preferred equity interest in ruby is senior to our interest. despite the bankruptcy filing, ruby continues to perform under its existing service contracts with pg&e, and pg&e has provided credit support on its trade payables to ruby through a prepayment arrangement.  while the ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings remains uncertain, there is the potential for ruby's existing contracts with pg&e to be canceled in the bankruptcy process.  any cancellation of these contracts could negatively impact ruby's future revenues and require us to evaluate our investment in ruby for an other than temporary impairment.  this could result in a material impairment of our investment in ruby at the time such events become known.
kml sale of trans mountain pipeline system and its expansion project on august 31, 2018, kml completed the sale of the tmpl, the tmep, the puget sound pipeline system and kinder morgan canada inc., the canadian employer of our staff that operate the business, which were indirectly acquired by the government of canada through trans mountain corporation (a subsidiary of the canada development investment corporation) for cash consideration of c$4.43 billion (u.s.$3.4 billion), which is the contractual purchase price of c$4.5 billion net of a preliminary working capital adjustment (the "tmpl sale"). these assets comprised our kinder morgan canada business segment. we recognized a pre-tax gain from the tmpl sale of $596 million within "loss on impairments and divestitures, net" in our accompanying consolidated statement of income during the year ended december 31, 2018, including an incremental working capital adjustment of $26 million accrued as of december 31, 2018.
on january 3, 2019, pursuant to kml's shareholders' approval on november 29, 2018, kml distributed to its shareholders as a return of capital, the net proceeds from the tmpl sale, after capital gains taxes, customary purchase price adjustments and the repayment of debt outstanding under a temporary kml credit facility (see note 9 "debt-credit facilities and restrictive covenants-kml"). kml's public owners of its restricted voting shares, reflected as noncontrolling interests by us, received approximately $0.9 billion (c$1.2 billion), and part of our approximate 70% portion of the net proceeds of $1.9 billion (c$2.5 billion) (after canadian tax) were used to immediately repay our outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $0.4 billion, and in february 2019, to pay down approximately $1.3 billion of maturing long-term debt. to facilitate the return of capital and provide flexibility for kml's dividends going forward, kml's shareholders also approved a reduction in the stated capital of its restricted voting shares by c$1.45 billion, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018, along with a "reverse stock split" of kml's restricted voting shares, and kml's special voting shares that we own, on a one-for-three basis (three shares consolidating to one share) which occurred on january 4, 2019.
kml continues to manage a portfolio of strategic infrastructure assets across western canada, including (i) the crude terminal facilities, which constitute the largest merchant terminal storage position in the edmonton market and the largest origination crude by rail loading facility in north america; (ii) the vancouver wharves terminal, the largest mineral concentrate export/import facility on the west coast of north america; (iii) the jet fuel pipeline system; and (iv) the canadian portion of the u.s. and canadian cochin pipeline system. these kml assets are part of our products pipelines and terminals business segments.
kml ipo the interest in the canadian business operations that we sold to the public on may 30, 2017 in kml's ipo represented an interest in all our operating assets in our kinder morgan canada business segment and our operating canadian assets in our terminals and products pipelines business segments. these canadian assets included the tmpl, tmep and the puget sound pipeline system, all of which have been sold in the tmpl sale, the jet fuel pipeline system, the canadian portion of the cochin pipeline system, the vancouver wharves terminal and the north 40 terminal; as well as three jointly controlled investments: the edmonton rail terminal, the alberta crude terminal and the base line terminal.
subsequent to the ipo, we retained control of kml, and as a result, it remains consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. the public ownership of the kml restricted voting shares is reflected within "noncontrolling interests" in our
38
consolidated statements of stockholders' equity and consolidated balance sheets. earnings attributable to the public ownership of kml are presented in "net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" in our consolidated statements of income for the periods presented after may 30, 2017. kml transacts in and/or uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency, which affects our segment results due to the variability in u.s. - canadian dollar exchange rates.
subsequent to its ipo, kml has obtained a credit facility and completed two preferred share offerings. kml continues to be a self-funding entity and we do not anticipate making contributions to fund its growth or operations.
2017 tax reform while the 2017 tax reform will ultimately be moderately positive for us, the reduced corporate income tax rate caused certain of our deferred-tax assets to be revalued at 21% versus 35% at the end of 2017.  although there is no impact to the underlying related deductions, which can continue to be used to offset future taxable income, we took an estimated approximately $1.4 billion non-cash accounting charge in 2017.  the positive impacts of the law include the reduced corporate income tax rate and the fact that several of our u.s. business units (essentially all but our interstate natural gas pipelines) will be able to deduct 100% of their capital expenditures through 2022.  see note 5 "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates, and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment.  certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared.  these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities, our revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements.  we routinely evaluate these estimates, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances.  nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates, and any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) income taxes; (iii) the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates; (iv) the fair values used to (a) assign purchase price from business combinations, (b) determine possible asset and equity investment impairment charges, and (c) calculate the annual goodwill impairment test; (v) reserves for environmental claims, legal fees, transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities; (vi) provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables; (vii) computing the gain or loss, if any, on assets sold in whole or in part; and (viii) exposures under contractual indemnifications.
for a summary of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements.  we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others, which policies are discussed as follows.
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure, we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts.  we expense or capitalize, as appropriate, environmental expenditures that relate to current operations, and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs.  generally, we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value, and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable. we record at fair value, where appropriate, environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination.
our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action, but generally, we recognize and/or adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations.  these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates. in making these liability estimations, we consider the effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us, and potential third party liability claims.  for more information on environmental matters, see
39
part i, items 1 and 2 "business and properties-(c) narrative description of business-environmental matters." for more information on our environmental disclosures, see note 18 "litigation, environmental and other contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements.
legal and regulatory matters many of our operations are regulated by various u.s. and canadian regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions.  we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders, judgments or settlements.  in general, we expense legal costs as incurred.  when we identify contingent liabilities, we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter.  generally, if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount, we record a liability equal to the low end of the range.  any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available. accordingly, to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected. for more information on legal proceedings, see note 18 "litigation, environmental and other contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements.
intangible assets intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance.  identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives, including goodwill, are not subject to regular periodic amortization, and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite.  instead, the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value.  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year. at year end and during other interim periods we evaluate our reporting units for events and changes that could indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount.
excluding goodwill, our other intangible assets include customer contracts, relationships and agreements, and technology-based assets.  these intangible assets have definite lives, are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives, and are reported separately as "other intangibles, net" in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
hedging activities we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate (offset) our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices, foreign currency exposure on euro denominated debt and net investments in foreign operations, and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates, and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives.  according to the provisions of gaap, to be considered effective, changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged, and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately.
all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value. we utilize published prices, broker quotes, and estimates of market prices to estimate the fair value of these contracts; however, actual amounts could vary materially from estimated fair values as a result of changes in market prices. in addition, changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts. for more information on our hedging activities, see note 14 "risk management" to our consolidated financial statements.
employee benefit plans we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status. as of december 31, 2018, our pension plans were underfunded by $702 million, and our other postretirement benefits plans were underfunded by $33 million. our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations. we use various assumptions in performing these calculations, including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets, the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term, the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors. a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations. we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans which applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the
40
determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows. the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 10 "share-based compensation and employee benefits" to our consolidated financial statements.
actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations, and as a result, our estimates associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits can be, and often are, revised in the future. the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected future service of active participants, or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants. as of december 31, 2018, we had deferred net losses of approximately $536 million in pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.
the following table shows the impact of a 1% change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits for the year ended december 31, 2018:
pension benefits                                                          other postretirement benefits net benefit cost (income)             change in funded status(a)          net benefit cost (income)               change in funded status(a)

income taxes income tax expense is recorded based on an estimate of the effective tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods. changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are enacted. we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state's tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed. therefore, we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate. changes in our effective rate, including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes, are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified.
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount that is more likely than not to not be realized. while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance, any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached.
in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments, we apply an accounting policy that looks through our investments. the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the non-tax-deductible goodwill portion of our investments, including kmi's investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary, kmp.

results of operations overview our management evaluates our performance primarily using the measures of segment ebda and, as discussed below under "-non-gaap financial measures," dcf, and segment ebda before certain items. segment ebda is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before dd&a and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers, such as general and administrative expenses, interest expense, net, and income taxes. our general and administrative expenses include such items as unallocated employee benefits, insurance, rentals, unallocated litigation and environmental expenses, and shared corporate services including accounting, information technology, human resources and legal services.
in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow, we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to dispositions and acquisitions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods.
effective january 1, 2019, certain assets were transferred between natural gas pipelines, products pipelines and terminals business segments, which are not reflected in the following business segment management discussion and analysis tables below.

(d)   2018, 2017 and 2016 amounts include net increases in expense of $24 million and $15 million and a net decrease in expense of $13 million, respectively, related to the combined net effect of the certain items related to general and administrative and corporate charges disclosed below in "-general and administrative and corporate charges, interest, net and noncontrolling interests."
(e)   2018, 2017 and 2016 amounts include a net increase in expense of $26 million and net decreases in expense of $39 million and $193 million, respectively, related to the combined net effect of the certain items related to interest expense, net disclosed below in "-general and administrative and corporate charges, interest, net and noncontrolling interests."
(f)   2018, 2017 and 2016 amounts include a net decrease of $58 million and net increases in expense of $1,085 million and $18 million, respectively, related to the combined net effect of the certain items related to income tax expense representing the income tax provision on certain items plus discrete income tax items.
year ended december 31, 2018 vs. 2017
the certain item totals reflected in footnotes (c) through (e) to the table above accounted for $41 million of the increase in income before income taxes in 2018 as compared to 2017 (representing the difference between decreases of $319 million and $360 million from certain items in income before income taxes for 2018 and 2017, respectively). after giving effect to these certain items, which are discussed in more detail in the discussion that follows, the remaining increase of $304 million (12%) from the prior year in income before income taxes is primarily attributable to increased performance from our natural gas pipelines, products pipelines, and co2 business segments and decreased general and administrative expense partially offset by increased dd&a expense, interest expense, net and lower earnings from our kinder morgan canada business segment as a result of the tmpl sale and our terminals business segment.
year ended december 31, 2017 vs. 2016
the certain item totals reflected in footnotes (c) through (e) to the table above accounted for $555 million of the increase in income before income taxes in 2017 as compared to 2016 (representing the difference between decreases of $360 million and $915 million from certain items in income before income taxes for 2017 and 2016, respectively). after giving effect to these certain items, which are discussed in more detail in the discussion that follows, the remaining decrease of $32 million (1%) from the prior year in income before income taxes is primarily attributable to decreased performance from our natural gas pipelines business segment, largely associated with our sale of a 50% interest in sng to the southern company (southern company) on september 1, 2016, and increased dd&a expense partially offset by decreased general and administrative expense and decreased interest expense.
non-gaap financial measures our non-gaap performance measures are dcf, both in the aggregate and per share, and segment ebda before certain items. certain items, as used to calculate our non-gaap measures, are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income, but typically either (i) do not have a cash impact (for example, asset impairments), or (ii) by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically (for example, certain legal settlements, enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses).
our non-gaap performance measures described below should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools. our computations of dcf and segment ebda before certain items may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. you should not consider these non-gaap performance measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap. dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap. management compensates for the limitations of these non-gaap performance measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures, understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes.
dcf dcf is calculated by adjusting net income available to common stockholders before certain items for dd&a, total book and cash taxes, sustaining capital expenditures and other items. dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and in measuring and estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends, paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends, stock repurchases, retirement of debt, or expansion capital expenditures. we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders. a reconciliation of dcf to net income available to common stockholders is provided in the table below. dcf per common share is dcf divided by average outstanding common shares, including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends.

segment ebda before certain items segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business. general and administrative expenses generally are not under the control of our segment operating managers, and therefore, are not included when we measure business segment operating performance. we believe segment ebda before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional

insight into the ability of our business segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis. we believe it is useful to investors because it is a performance measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment's performance. we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to segment ebda before certain items is segment ebda.
in the tables for each of our business segments under "- segment earnings results" below, segment ebda before certain items and revenues before certain items are calculated by adjusting the segment ebda and revenues for the applicable certain item amounts, which are totaled in the tables and described in the footnotes to those tables. revenues before certain items is provided to further enhance our analysis of segment ebda before certain items and is not a performance measure.

the changes in segment ebda for our natural gas pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2018 and 2017:
•   midstream's increase of $150 million (14%) was primarily due to increased earnings from texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations, kinderhawk, hiland midstream and south texas midstream. texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations were favorably impacted by higher volumes with new and existing customers serving the mexico and texas gulf coast industrial markets partially offset by lower park and loan revenues and storage margins. kinderhawk and south texas midstream benefited from increased drilling and production in the haynesville and eagle ford basins, respectively. hiland midstream increased earnings were primarily due to higher gas and crude oil volumes and higher ngl sales prices. while these factors also drove an increase in revenue, these increases in revenues were partially offset by the effect of the january 1, 2018 adoption of topic 606 which caused a corresponding decrease in cost of goods sold;
•   west region's increase of $100 million (11%) was primarily due to higher earnings from epng, cig and cpgpl. epng experienced higher volumes in 2018 from increased permian basin-related activity and associated capacity sales. cig and cpgpl earnings were higher due to continued growing production in the denver julesburg basin;
•   north region's increase of $43 million (4%) was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from ngpl, and higher earnings from tgp and kmlp. ngpl increase in earnings was due to increased permian basin-related activity and lower interest expense resulting from a 2017 refinancing, partially offset by lower storage-related revenue. tgp and kmlp contributed increased earnings primarily from expansion projects recently placed in service; and
•   south region's increase of $33 million (5%) was primarily due to increases in equity earnings from citrus and sng, and an increase in earnings from slng, partially offset by a decrease in earnings from southern gulf lng due to a loss of revenues from an arbitration ruling calling for a contract termination. citrus had lower income tax expense due to the 2017 tax reform, and sng increased earnings were from higher transportation revenues from increased system usage and non-recurring 2017 operating expenses. slng earnings were driven by higher capitalized afudc equity associated with the elba liquefaction project.

the changes in segment ebda for our natural gas pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2017 and 2016:
•   south region's decrease of $143 million (18%) was primarily due to the sale of a 50% interest in sng to southern company on september 1, 2016, partially offset by an increase in earnings from elba express primarily due to an expansion project placed in service in december 2016;
•   midstream's decrease of $66 million (6%) was primarily due to decreases in earnings from south texas midstream, kinderhawk and oklahoma midstream, partially offset by increased earnings from texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations and altamont midstream. south texas midstream lower earnings were primarily due to lower commodity based service revenues and residue gas sales as a result of lower volumes partially offset by higher ngl sales gross margin primarily due to rising ngl prices. kinderhawk experienced lower volumes, which lowered its earnings and oklahoma midstream's lower earnings were primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable producer mix. texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations increased earnings were primarily due to higher transportation margins as a result of higher volumes and higher park and loan revenues partially offset by lower storage and sales margins. altamont midstream primarily increased earnings were due to higher natural gas and liquids revenues due to higher commodity prices and volumes. texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations, hiland midstream and oklahoma midstream had increases in revenues due to higher commodity prices which was largely offset by a corresponding increases in costs of sales;
•   west region's decrease of $38 million (4%) was primarily due to a decrease in earnings at cig, partially offset by higher earnings at epng. cig lower earnings were primarily due to a decrease in tariff rates effective january 1, 2017 as a result of a rate case settlement entered into in 2016. epng had higher earnings primarily due to higher transportation revenues driven by incremental permian basin capacity sales and an increase in volumes due to the ramp up of existing customer volumes associated with an expansion project partially offset by increased operations and maintenance expense; and
•   north region's increase of $84 million (7%) was primarily due to higher earnings from tgp and an increase in equity earnings from ngpl. tgp's increase in earnings was primarily due to higher firm transportation revenues driven by incremental capacity sales and expansion projects recently placed in service. ngpl higher earnings were primarily due to lower interest expense due to a reduction in interest rates due to debt refinancing and the repayment of bank borrowings in 2017.

the changes in segment ebda for our products pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2018 and 2017:
•   ngls' increase of $33 million (27%) was primarily due to increases in earnings from cochin pipeline and to a lesser extent an increase in earnings from equity earnings from utopia, which went into service in 2018. cochin's earnings were higher primarily due to foreign exchange transaction losses in 2017 primarily related to an intercompany note receivable, integrity work during 2017 and an expansion project placed in service during 2018;
•   southeast refined products' increase of $26 million (11%) was primarily due to increased equity earnings from plantation pipeline and earnings from south east terminals. plantation pipeline earnings were higher primarily due to lower income tax expense due to the 2017 tax reform, lower operating expense attributable to a 2017 project write-off and product net gains as a result of higher product prices. south east terminals earnings were favorably impacted primarily due to higher revenues as a result of expansion projects that were placed into service in the later part of 2017 and higher volumes with existing customers;
•   crude &amp; condensate's decrease of $15 million (4%) was primarily due to a decrease of earnings from kinder morgan crude &amp; condensate pipeline partially offset by an increase of double h pipeline earnings. the kinder morgan crude &amp; condensate pipeline lower earnings were primarily due to lower services revenues as a result of unfavorable rates on contract renewals partially offset by recognition of deficiency revenue. double h pipeline increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in volumes and the recognition of deficiency revenue; and
•   west coast refined products' decrease of $3 million (1%) was primarily due to lower earnings from pacific operations partially offset by an increase in calnev earnings. pacific operations earnings were lower primarily due to higher operating expenses driven by an unfavorable change in product gain/loss, an increase in 2018 environmental reserves and higher fuel and power costs. calnev earnings were higher due to an increase in services revenues driven by an increase in volumes, the result of an interruption of service by a provider for a competing pipeline that also serves the las vegas market.

the changes in segment ebda for our products pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2017 and 2016:
•   west coast refined products' increase of $7 million (1%) was primarily due to improved earnings at both pacific operations and calnev. pacific operations increase in earnings was primarily due to higher service revenues driven by an increase in volumes partially offset by a volume driven increase in power costs and an increase in right-of-way expense. calnev earnings were higher primarily due to higher service revenues driven by higher volumes and a decrease in expense related to the reduction of a rate reserve;
•   ngls' increase of $4 million (3%) was primarily due to increased development fee revenues in 2017 for utopia pipeline ;
•   southeast refined products' increase of $3 million (1%) was primarily due to increased earnings at south east terminals and to a lesser extent at transmix processing operations, partially offset by our sale of a 50% interest in parkway pipeline on july 1, 2016. south east terminals increased earnings were primarily due to higher revenues driven by higher volumes as a result of capital expansion projects being placed in service during 2017. the decrease in revenues was driven by lower sales volumes primarily due to the sale of our indianola plant in august 2016 and lower brokered sales at the dorsey plant due to an expired contract in may 2017; and
•   crude &amp; condensate's decrease of $1 million (-%) was primarily due a decrease in earnings on kinder morgan crude &amp; condensate pipeline resulting from higher cost of goods sold offset by an increase in earnings from double eagle primarily due to higher revenues driven by higher volumes and price.

the changes in segment ebda for our terminals business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2018 and 2017:
•   decrease of $19 million (15%) from our northeast terminals primarily due to low utilization at our staten island terminal;
•   decrease of $19 million (22%) from our gulf central terminals primarily related to the sale of a 40% membership interest in the deeprock development joint venture in july 2017 and the expiration of a crude by rail terminaling contract in august 2018 at our deer park rail terminal;
•   decrease of $8 million (13%) from our southeast terminals primarily due to the sale of certain terminal assets in december 2017 and higher operating expenses at our steel handling operations;
•   decrease of $1 million (1%) from our alberta canada terminals primarily due to an increase in operating expenses associated with tank lease fees at our edmonton south terminal following the tmpl sale and the impact of the expiration of a third party crude-by-rail terminaling contract at our edmonton rail terminal joint venture partially offset by an increase in earnings due to the commencement of operations at our base line terminal joint venture;
•   increase of $31 million (11%) from our gulf liquids terminals primarily driven by contributions from expansion projects at our pasadena terminal and the kinder morgan export terminal as well as organic volume growth at several of our houston ship channel locations;
•   increase of $6 million (8%) from our midwest terminals primarily driven by increased ethanol storage revenues and new liquids customer contracts entered into in 2018; and
•   increase of $3 million (2%) from our marine operations primarily due to the incremental earnings from the march 2017, june 2017, july 2017 and december 2017 deliveries of the jones act tankers, the american freedom, palmetto state, american liberty and american pride, respectively, partially offset by decreased contributions from existing jones act tankers driven by lower charter rates and a reduced operating cost credit attributable to capitalized overhead.

•   increase of $20 million (8%) from our gulf liquids terminals primarily related to higher volumes as a result of various expansion projects, including the recently commissioned kinder morgan export terminal and north docks terminal, partially offset by lost revenue associated with hurricane harvey-related operational disruptions;
•   increase of $8 million (6%) from our alberta, canada terminals primarily due to escalations in predominantly fixed, take-or-pay terminaling contracts and a true-up in terminal fees in connection with a favorable arbitration ruling;
•   increase of $7 million (11%) from our midwest terminals primarily driven by increased ethanol throughput revenues in 2017 and a new bulk storage and handling contract entered into fourth quarter 2016;
•   decrease of $19 million (100%) from our sale of certain bulk terminal facilities to an affiliate of watco companies, llc in december 2016 and early 2017; and
•   decrease of $17 million (16%) from our gulf central terminals primarily related to the sale of a 40% membership interest in the deeprock development joint venture in july 2017 and the subsequent change in accounting treatment of our retained 11% membership interest as well as lost revenue associated with hurricane harvey-related operational disruptions.

the changes in segment ebda for our co2 business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving segment ebda before certain items in the comparable years of 2018 and 2017:
•   increase of $27 million (5%) from our oil and gas producing activities primarily due to increased revenues of $45 million primarily driven by higher ngl prices of $23 million and higher volumes of $22 million partially offset by an increase of $16 million in operating expenses and higher severance tax expense of $2 million; and
•   decrease of $7 million (2%) from our source and transportation activities primarily due to lower other revenues of $5 million, higher ad valorem tax expense of $4 million and decreased earnings from an equity investee of $3 million partially offset by higher co2 sales of $3 million driven by higher contract sales prices of $25 million offset by lower volumes of $22 million and lower operating expenses of $2 million. the increase in revenues of $52 million is primarily due to the effect of the january 1, 2018 adoption of topic 606, which increased both revenues and operating expenses (costs of sales) by $54 million, as discussed in note 16 "revenue recognition" to our consolidated financial statements.

•   decrease of $34 million (6%) from our oil and gas producing activities primarily due to decreased revenues of $33 million driven by lower volumes of $22 million and lower commodity prices of $11 million, and higher operating expenses of $1 million.

certain items affecting segment ebda
(a)   2018 amount includes a gain of $596 million on the tmpl sale.
other
(b)   represents tmpl average daily volumes reported until date of sale, august 31, 2018.
for the comparable years of 2018 and 2017, the kinder morgan canada business segment had a decrease in segment ebda of $62 million (33%) primarily due to the tmpl sale on august 31, 2018 sale. as a result of the tmpl sale on august 31, 2018, this business segment does not have results of operations on a prospective basis.
for the comparable years of 2017 and 2016, the kinder morgan canada business segment had an increase in segment ebda of $5 million (3%) and an increase in revenues of $3 million (1%) primarily due to (i) higher capitalized equity financing costs due to spending on the tmep; (ii) currency translation gains due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar; and (iii) higher incentive revenues partly offset by lower state of washington volumes and operating expense timing changes.

certain items
(a)   2018 amount includes: (i) an increase in expense of $10 million associated with an estimated environmental reserve adjustment; (ii) a decrease in expense of $12 million related to the release of certain sales and use tax reserves; (iii) an increase in expense of $10 million of asset sale related costs; (iv) an increase in expense of $9 million related to certain corporate litigation matters; and (v) an increase in expense of $7 million related to other certain items. 2017 amount includes: (i) an increase in expense of $10 million for acquisition and divestiture related costs; (ii) an increase in expense of $4 million related to certain corporate litigation matters; (iii) an increase in expense of $5 million related to a pension settlement; and (iv) a decrease in expense of $4 million related to other certain items. 2016 amount includes increases in expense of (i) $14 million related to severance costs; and (ii) $12 million related to acquisition and divestiture costs; offset by decreases in expense of (i) $34 million related to certain corporate litigation matters; and (ii) $5 million related to other certain items.
(b)   2018, 2017 and 2016 amounts include: (i) decreases in interest expense of $32 million, $44 million and $115 million, respectively, related to amortization of non-cash debt fair value adjustments associated with acquisitions and (ii) an increase of $9 million and decreases of $3 million and $44 million, respectively, in interest expense related to non-cash true-ups of our estimates of swap ineffectiveness. 2018 amount also includes increases in interest expense of $47 million related to the write-off of capitalized kml credit facility fees and $2 million related to other certain items. 2017 amount also includes an $8 million increase in interest expense related to other certain items. 2016 amount also includes a $34 million decrease in interest expense related to certain litigation matters.
(c)   2018 amount is primarily associated with the $596 million gain on the tmpl sale and is disclosed above in "-kinder morgan canada." the 2016 amount is associated with natural gas pipelines segment certain items and disclosed above in "-natural gas pipelines."
general and administrative expenses and corporate charges before certain items decreased $81 million in 2018 and $20 million in 2017 when compared with the respective prior year. the decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher capitalized costs of $54 million driven by the 2018 construction of elba liquefaction, gulf coast and hiland facilities offset by lower spending on tgp, lower vacation and labor accruals of $18 million and $7 million from the sale of tmpl. the decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily driven by the sale of a 50% interest in our sng natural gas pipeline system (effective september 1, 2016), higher capitalized costs, lower state franchise taxes, legal and insurance costs, partially offset by higher labor accruals and pension costs.
in the table above, we report our interest expense as "net," meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount.  our consolidated interest expense net of interest income before certain items, increased $20 million in 2018 and decreased $128 million in 2017 when compared with the respective prior year. the increase in interest expense in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and higher short-term debt balance partially offset by lower average long-term debt balance. the decrease in interest expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower weighted average debt balances as proceeds from the may 2017 kml ipo and our september 2016 sale of a 50% interest in sng were used to pay down debt, partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt.
we use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long-term fixed rate debt securities (senior notes) into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 31% and 28%, respectively, of the principal amount of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates-either as short-term or long-term variable rate debt obligations or as fixed-rate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps. for more information on our interest rate swaps, see note 14 "risk management-interest rate risk management" to our consolidated financial statements.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not owned by us.  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests before certain items increased $30 million in 2018 and $19 million in 2017 when compared with the respective prior year. the increases were primarily due to the may 30, 2017 sale of approximately 30% of our canadian business operations to the public in the kml ipo.
income taxes year ended december 31, 2018 versus year ended december 31, 2017
our tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 is approximately $587 million, as compared with 2017 tax expense of $1,938 million.  the $1,351 million decrease in tax expense is primarily due to (i) the decrease in the federal income tax rate as a result of the 2017 tax reform; and (ii) the decrease in uncertain tax positions as a result of audit settlements; partially offset by (i) the tax impact on the tmpl sale; and (ii) the decrease of enhanced oil recovery credits.
56
year ended december 31, 2017 versus year ended december 31, 2016
our tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 is approximately $1,938 million, as compared with 2016 tax expense of $917 million.  the $1,021 million increase in tax expense is primarily due to (i) an increase in year-over-year earnings as a result of fewer asset impairments and project write-offs in 2017; and (ii) higher tax expense as a result of the 2017 tax reform. these increases are partially offset by (i) the 2016 impact of our regulated natural gas pipelines business segment's $817 million non-tax-deductible goodwill as a result of the sale of a 50% interest in sng; and (ii) the recognition of enhanced oil recovery credits.
liquidity and capital resources general as of december 31, 2018, we had $3,280 million of "cash and cash equivalents," an increase of $3,016 million (1,142%) from december 31, 2017.  we believe our cash position, remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility (discussed below in "-short-term liquidity"), and our cash flows from operating activities are adequate to allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements and anticipated obligations as discussed further below.
we have consistently generated substantial cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds of $5,043 million and $4,601 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. the year-to-year increase is discussed below in "-cash flows-operating activities." generally, we primarily rely on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service, sustaining capital expenditures, dividend payments, and our growth capital expenditures. we also generally expect that our short-term liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations, short-term borrowings or by issuing new long-term debt to refinance certain of our maturing long-term debt obligations. moreover, as a result of our current common stock dividend policy and our continued focus on disciplined capital allocation, we do not expect the need to access the equity capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future.
additionally, during 2018 the tmpl sale mentioned above in "-general-kml-sale of trans mountain pipeline system and its expansion project" was a source of liquidity and the primary driver of cash on hand as of december 31, 2018.
on january 3, 2019, pursuant to kml's shareholders' approval on november 29, 2018, kml distributed to its shareholders as a return of capital, the net proceeds from the tmpl sale, after capital gains taxes, customary purchase price adjustments and the repayment of debt outstanding under a temporary kml credit facility (see "-kml 2018 credit facility" following). kml's public owners of its restricted voting shares, reflected as noncontrolling interests by us, received approximately $0.9 billion (c$1.2 billion), and part of our approximately 70% portion of the net proceeds of $1.9 billion (c$2.5 billion) (after canadian tax) were used to immediately repay our outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $0.4 million and in february 2019 to pay down approximately $1.3 billion of maturing long-term debt. to facilitate the return of capital and provide flexibility for kml's dividends going forward, kml's shareholders also approved a reduction in the stated capital of its restricted voting shares by c$1.45 billion, along with a "reverse stock split" of kml's restricted voting shares, and kml's special voting shares that we own, on a one-for-three basis (three shares consolidating to one share) which occurred on january 4, 2019.
kml 2018 credit facility upon the closing of the tmpl sale on august 31, 2018, kml established a 4-year, c$500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "kml 2018 credit facility") for working capital purposes, replacing a temporary credit facility that was put in place following the announcement of the tmpl sale on may 30, 2018 (the "kml temporary credit facility"). the c$133 million (u.s.$102 million) of outstanding borrowings under the kml temporary credit facility were paid off prior to its termination with a portion of the proceeds from the tmpl sale. as of december 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the kml 2018 credit facility.
credit ratings and capital market liquidity we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives. we expect that our short-term liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or short-term borrowings. generally, we anticipate re-financing maturing long term debt obligations in the debt capital markets and are therefore subject to certain market conditions which could result in higher costs or negatively affect our and/or our subsidiaries' credit ratings.
57
as of december 31, 2018, our short-term corporate debt ratings were a-3 (upgraded to a-2 on january 7, 2019), prime-2 and f3 at standard and poor's, moody's investor services and fitch ratings, inc., respectively. we are on a positive outlook for an upgrade by fitch ratings, inc.

(a)   subsequently was upgraded to bbb on january 7, 2019 with a stable outlook.
short-term liquidity as of december 31, 2018, our principal sources of short-term liquidity are (i) our $4.5 billion revolving credit facilities and associated $4.0 billion commercial paper program; (ii) the kml 2018 credit facility (for the purposes described above); and (iii) cash from operations. the loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program. borrowings under our commercial paper program and letters of credit reduce borrowings allowed under ours and kml's respective credit facilities. we provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility (see note 9 "debt-credit facilities and restrictive covenants-kmi" to our consolidated financial statements) and, as previously discussed, we have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations.
as of december 31, 2018, our $3,388 million of short-term debt consisted primarily of (i) $433 million outstanding under our $4.0 billion commercial paper program; and (ii) $2,800 million of senior notes that mature in the next year. as previously discussed, we repaid $1.7 billion of this short-term debt in 2019 from a portion of the tmpl sale proceeds. we intend to refinance our remaining short-term debt through credit facility borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, or by issuing new long-term debt or paying down short-term debt using cash retained from operations. our short-term debt balance as of december 31, 2017 was $2,828 million.
we had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of $1,835 million and $3,466 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our current liabilities may include short-term borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures, which we may periodically replace with long-term financing and/or pay down using retained cash from operations. the overall $1,631 million (47%) favorable change from year-end 2017 was primarily due to: (i) the $2,998 million of proceeds from the tmpl sale, net of cash disposed, partially offset by (i) the $890 million (c$1,195 million) distribution paid to our noncontrolling interests associated with kml on january 3, 2019 ($876 million was the accrued u.s.$ value as of december 31, 2018) and a $516 million increase in current maturities of our senior notes. generally, our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments, timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables, the change in fair value of our derivative contracts, and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities (discussed below in "-long-term financing" and "-capital expenditures").
we employ a centralized cash management program for our u.s.-based bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing. these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our wholly owned subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group. we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities, payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to kmi other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities.
certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to ferc-enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs. ferc-regulated entities subject to these rules must, among other things, place their cash management agreements in writing, maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements, and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc.

long-term financing our equity consists of class p common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. we do not expect to need to access the equity capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future. furthermore, through january 2019, we have repurchased approximately 29 million shares of our class p common stock under a $2 billion share buy-back program authorized by our board of directors in december 2017 that we funded through retained cash. for more information on our equity buy-back program and our equity distribution agreement, see note 11 "stockholders' equity" to our consolidated financial statements.
from time to time, we issue long-term debt securities, often referred to as senior notes.  all of our senior notes issued to date, other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries, generally have very similar terms, except for interest rates, maturity dates and prepayment premiums. all of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date, and, in most cases, plus a make-whole premium.  in addition, from time to time our subsidiaries, have issued long-term debt securities. furthermore, we and almost all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each guarantee the debt of each other. see note 20 "guarantee of securities of subsidiaries" to our consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various long-term debt obligations (excluding current maturities) was $33,205 million and $34,088 million, respectively. for more information regarding our debt-related transactions in 2018, see note 9 "debt" to our consolidated financial statements.
we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing long-term fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings.
for additional information about our outstanding senior notes and debt-related transactions in 2018 and early 2019, see note 9 "debt" to our consolidated financial statements.  for information about our interest rate risk, see item 7a "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-interest rate risk."
capital expenditures we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap. we also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenance/sustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures (which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures). expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement, and are not deducted in calculating dcf (see "-results of operations-dcf"). with respect to our oil and gas producing activities, we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput (i.e., production capacity) from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements. maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity. the distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one, irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased.
budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottom-up basis. for each of our assets, we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations, meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law. we may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency and/or lowering future expenses. budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a project-by-project basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures. generally, the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenance/sustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level. the classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process, but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion. the classification has an impact on dcf because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from dcf, while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are. see "-common dividends" and "-preferred dividends."

cash flows operating activities the net increase of $442 million (10%) in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to:
•   a $346 million increase in cash associated with net changes in working capital items and other non-current assets and liabilities, primarily driven, among other things, by a $137 income tax refund received in the 2018 period, and an increase in current income tax liabilities associated with the tax gain on the tmpl sale in the 2018 period. these increases were partially offset by higher payments for litigation matters in the 2018 period compared with the 2017 period; and
•   a $96 million increase in operating cash flow resulting from the combined effects of adjusting the $1,696 million increase in net income for the period-to-period net changes in non-cash items including the following: (i) loss on impairments and divestitures, net (see discussion above in "-results of operations"); (ii) loss on impairments and divestitures of equity investments, net (see discussion above in "-results of operations"); (iii) the change in fair market value of derivative contracts; (iv) dd&amp;a expenses (including amortization of excess cost of equity investments); (v) deferred income taxes; (vi) earnings from equity investments; and (vii) loss on early extinguishment of debt.
investing activities the $3,335 million net decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to:
•   a $2,998 million increase in cash reflecting proceeds received from the tmpl sale, net of cash disposed in the 2018 period. see note 3 "divestitures and acquisition" for further information regarding this transaction;
•   a $284 million decrease in capital expenditures in the 2018 period over the comparative 2017 period primarily due to lower expenditures in our terminals business segment, partially offset by higher expenditures related to construction projects in our natural gas pipelines business segment;
•   a $251 million decrease in cash used for contributions to equity investments primarily due to lower contributions we made to ngpl holdings llc, fep and utopia holding llc in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period, partially offset by the contributions made to gulf coast express pipeline llc in the 2018 period; and
•   a $124 million increase in cash proceeds received from the sale of equity investments, primarily driven by a sale of our partial interest in gulf coast express llc in the 2018 period; partially offset by,
•   a $138 million decrease in cash proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and other net assets in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period; and
•   a $137 million decrease in cash resulting from lower distributions received from equity investments in excess of cumulative earnings, primarily from mep, sng and citrus corporation in the 2018 period over the comparative 2017 period.
financing activities the net increase of $143 million in cash used by financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to:
•   a combined $1,665 million decrease in cash reflecting $1,245 million net proceeds we received from the kml ipo in may 2017 and $420 million net proceeds received from the kml preferred share issuances in the 2017 period;
•   a $498 million increase in dividend payments to our common shareholders;
61
•   a $304 million decrease in cash due to lower contributions received from eig in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period as the 2017 period included $386 million we received from eig global energy partners for our sale of a 49% partnership interest in elc;
•   a $36 million increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests, primarily to kml restricted share holders and preferred shareholders; and
•   a $23 million increase in cash used for common shares repurchased under our common share buy-back program in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period; partially offset by,
•   a $2,384 million net increase in cash related to debt activity as a result of $118 million of net debt issuances in the 2018 period compared to $2,266 million of net debt payments in the 2017 period. see note 9 "debt" for further information regarding our debt activity.

we will continue to return additional value to our shareholders in 2019 through our previously announced dividend increase. we plan to increase our dividend to $1.00 per common share in 2019 and $1.25 per common share in 2020, a growth rate of 25% annually.
the actual amount of common stock dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, business prospects, capital requirements, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints, tax laws, delaware laws and other factors. see item 1a "risk factors-the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates. circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business." all of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends.
62
our common stock dividends are not cumulative. consequently, if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels, our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future. our common stock dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each february, may, august and november.
stock buy-back program on july 19, 2017, our board of directors approved a $2 billion common share buy-back program that began in december 2017. during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased approximately 15 million and 14 million, respectively, of our class p shares for approximately $273 million and $250 million, respectively. 2018 amounts exclude repurchases made in december 2018 of approximately 0.1 million of our class p shares for approximately $2 million, which settled on january 2, 2019.
noncontrolling interests the caption "noncontrolling interests" in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets consists of interests that we do not own in the following subsidiaries (in millions):
december 31,
2018                                2017
kml(a)      $514              $1,163
others       339                 325
$853              $1,488
_______
(a)   the reduction in the noncontrolling interests associated with kml is primarily attributable to the accrual of the return of capital distribution for the net proceeds from the tmpl sale paid to kml's restricted voting shareholders on january 3, 2019 of approximately $0.9 billion. for more information see "-general-kml-sale of trans mountain pipeline system and its expansion project" above.
kml distributions kml has a dividend policy pursuant to which it may pay a quarterly dividend on its restricted voting shares in an amount based on a portion of its distributable cash flow. the payment of dividends is not guaranteed, and the amount and timing of any dividends payable will be at the discretion of kml's board of directors. kml intends to pay quarterly dividends, if any, on or about the 45th day (or next business day) following the end of each calendar quarter to holders of its restricted voting shares of record as of the close of business on or about the last business day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter. kml also established a dividend reinvestment plan (drip) that allows holders (excluding holders not resident in canada) of restricted voting shares to elect to have any or all cash dividends payable to such shareholder automatically reinvested in additional restricted voting shares at a price per share calculated by reference to the volume-weighted average of the closing price of the restricted voting shares on the stock exchange on which the restricted voting shares are then listed for the five trading days immediately preceding the relevant dividend payment date, less a discount of between 0% and 5% (as determined from time to time by kml's board of directors, in its sole discretion).
on january 16, 2019, kml's board of directors announced that it would suspend kml's drip, effective with the payment of the fourth quarter 2018 dividend on february 15, 2019, in light of kml's reduced need for capital.
for 2019, kml announced that it expects to pay an annual dividend of c$0.65 per split-adjusted restricted voting share.
kml also pays dividends on its 12,000,000 series 1 preferred shares and 10,000,000 series 3 preferred shares, which are fixed, cumulative, preferential, and payable quarterly in the annual amount of c$1.3125 per share and c$1.3000 per share, respectively, on the 15th day of february, may, august and november, as and when declared by kml's board of directors, for the initial fixed rate period to but excluding november 15, 2022 and february 15, 2023, respectively.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, kml paid dividends on its restricted voting shares to the public valued at $52 million, of which $38 million was paid in cash. the remaining value of $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 was paid in 1,092,791 kml restricted voting shares. kml also paid dividends to the public on its series 1 and series 3 preferred shares of $21 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.

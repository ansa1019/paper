item 1a.   risk factors our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. if any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.
crude oil, natural gas, and ngl price volatility could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.
our revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, and ngl production. historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. for example, the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2018 ranged from a high of $76.41 per barrel to a low of $42.53 per barrel. the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2018 ranged from a high of $4.84 per mmbtu to a low of $2.55 per mmbtu. the market prices for crude oil, natural gas, and ngls depend on factors beyond our control. these factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:
•   worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls;
•   actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec);
•   political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in oil and gas producing regions;
•   the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;
•   the price and level of imported foreign crude oil, natural gas, and ngls;
•   the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;
•   the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;
•   the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;
•   weather conditions;
•   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and
•   the overall economic environment.
our results of operations, as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil and natural gas, which have declined significantly since june 2014. despite slight increases in oil and natural gas prices in 2018, prices have remained significantly lower than levels seen in recent years, which has adversely affected our revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves. continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures. without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. sustained low prices of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls may further adversely impact our business as follows:
•   limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;
•   reducing the amount of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls that we can produce economically;
•   causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;
•   reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;
•   limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;
•   reducing the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash impairments;
•   reducing the carrying value of our gathering, transmission, and processing facilities, resulting in additional impairments; or
•   reducing the carrying value of goodwill.
14
our ability to sell crude oil, natural gas, or ngls and/or receive market prices for these commodities may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions.
a portion of our crude oil, natural gas, and ngl production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows.
future economic conditions in the u.s. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.
current global market conditions and uncertainty, including the economic instability in europe and certain emerging markets, are likely to have significant long-term effects on our operating results. global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. a lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our oil and gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.
weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and production.
demand for oil and gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. in addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the gulf of mexico, or storms in the north sea, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.
our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls, including:
•   well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;
•   pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills;
•   fires;
•   formations with abnormal pressures;
•   equipment malfunctions;
•   hurricanes, storms, and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on and offshore the gulf coast and north sea, and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions; and
•   surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.
failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyberattacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution, and other damages for which we could be liable. litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. if a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective, or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
15
a terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by us or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.
our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. we depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with our employees and third party partners, and conduct many of our activities. unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks, environmental activist group activities, or cyberattacks than other targets in the united states. also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the united states and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market our production. a cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. any such terrorist attack, environmental activist group activity, or cyberattack that affects the company or our customers, suppliers, or others with whom we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause it to incur a material financial loss, subject it to possible legal claims and liability, and/or damage our reputation.
while we have experienced cyberattacks in the past, we have not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. in addition, cyberattacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost, or capital expenditures. the company cannot predict the potential impact to our business or the energy industry resulting from additional regulations.
our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.
to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:
•   our production falls short of the hedged volumes;
•   there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;
•   the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or
•   an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices.
the credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.
we have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. we may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. we also have exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. in addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender's commitment under our credit facilities.
16
we are exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. this risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant decline in commodity prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty's liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. we are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or ability to perform. even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities. during periods of falling commodity prices, our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.
the distressed financial conditions of our purchasers and partners could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or to reimburse us for their share of costs.
concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil, natural gas, and ngl prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. we are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. we sell our crude oil, natural gas, and ngls to a variety of purchasers. as operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. as a result of current economic conditions and the severe decline in commodity prices, some of our customers and non-operating partners may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or non-operating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.
a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.
we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, commodity pricing levels, and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies. a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt; past ratings downgrades have required, and any future downgrades may require, us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. throughout 2018, our credit rating remained unchanged by moody's at baa3/stable and standard and poor's at bbb/stable. any future downgrades could result in additional postings of collateral ranging from approximately $700 million to $1.1 billion, depending upon timing and availability of tax relief.
market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.
the financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. we have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. we and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. this could significantly delay development of our property interests.
our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.
the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.
any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including common stock. in addition, under delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from "surplus," which is the amount by which the fair value of our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then-current and/or the preceding fiscal year. further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.
17
discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.
the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.
we may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. the costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:
•   unexpected drilling conditions;
•   pressure or irregularities in formations;
•   equipment failures or accidents;
•   fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;
•   marine risks, such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;
•   other adverse weather conditions; and
•   increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and equipment.
future drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. while all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.
material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.
we are involved in several large development projects, and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. in addition, our estimates of future development costs are based on current expectation of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel we will need to implement such projects. our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate. if costs become too high, our development projects may become uneconomic to us, and we may be forced to abandon such development projects.
18
we may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.
although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. it generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. however, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. in addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.
our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of our transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case.
from time to time we have divested noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets. the agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, and similar arrangements. one of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by us. one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress. in the event that any such counterparty were to become the subject of a case or proceeding under title 11 of the united states code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as insolvency laws), the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. in that case, our remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not we have collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. resolution of our claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed, and we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise.
despite the provisions in our agreements requiring purchasers of our state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, we would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require us to perform and hold us responsible for such liabilities and obligations. in such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.
if a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact our cash flows, operations, or financial condition.
crude oil, natural gas, and ngl reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil, natural gas, and ngl reserves and their value. reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls that cannot be measured in an exact manner. because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. in addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. the estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:
•   historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;
•   the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;
•   future operating costs and capital expenditures; and
•   workover and remediation costs.
19
for these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue, and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.
additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. in addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.
certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.
a sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. if our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.
we may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.
as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment. these laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. in addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.
our united states operations are subject to governmental risks.
our united states operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations.
in response to the deepwater horizon incident in the u.s. gulf of mexico in april 2010 and as directed by the secretary of the u.s. department of the interior, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (bsee) issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the gulf of mexico. these regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the gulf of mexico.
with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico, the boem has issued a notice to lessees (ntl no. 2016-n01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies' oil and gas leases. while requirements under the ntl have not yet been fully implemented by boem, the ntl will likely require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to apache's current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases. we are working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the ntl. additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership. such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties' solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.
new political developments, the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting our united states operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact our results of operations.
20
changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.
certain countries where we operate, including the united kingdom, either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (ghg) related fees on our operations. exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. additionally, there has been discussion in other countries where we operate, including the united states, regarding legislation or regulation of ghg. any such legislation or regulation, if enacted, could either tax or assess some form of ghg-related fees on our operations and could lead to increased operating expenses or cause us to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications.
in the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations. however, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.
negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.
negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, and increased risk of litigation. moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance, and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.
the present u.s. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. future legislation may result in the elimination of certain u.s. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (the act) was signed into law. in addition to reducing the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1, 2018, certain provisions in the act move the u.s. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income. the new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. the act also includes provisions which could impact or limit the company's ability to deduct interest expense or utilize net operating losses beginning in 2018.
the u.s. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be further modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key u.s. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. these changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. the passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.
several proposals are before the u.s. congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act. several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation, ballot initiatives, executive orders, or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity. in addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so. we routinely use fracturing techniques in the u.s. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. it is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability.
21
although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the u.s.
international operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.
our operations outside the united states are based primarily in egypt and the united kingdom. on a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 44 percent of our 2018 production was outside the united states, and approximately 28 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on december 31, 2018, were located outside the united states. as a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:
•   general strikes and civil unrest;
•   the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;
•   import and export regulations;
•   taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;
•   price control;
•   transportation regulations and tariffs;
•   constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;
•   exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluations, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;
•   laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;
•   the effects of the u.k.'s potential withdrawal from the european union, including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the british pound;
•   the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;
•   the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states; and
•   difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.
foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management's attention from our more significant assets. certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. in an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities, as have occurred in countries and regions in which we operate, may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time. uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.
22
a deterioration of conditions in egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.
deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with egpc, or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our operations in egypt, excluding a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed 24 percent of our 2018 production and accounted for 12 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves and 20 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows.
our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.
our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the u.s. dollar and the british pound. our financial statements, presented in u.s. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies.
we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements, and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.
we conduct many of our e&p operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not an operator under the agreement. there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and, therefore, decisions may be made which are not what we believe to be in our best interest. moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. in either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.
we face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas e&p industry. we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and ngl production. crude oil, natural gas, and ngl prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic, long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. in addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. these competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.
exploration for and production of crude oil, natural gas, and ngls can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fires, explosions, and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment. our international operations are also subject to political risk. the insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.
certain anti-takeover provisions in our charter and delaware law could delay or prevent a hostile takeover.
our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights and dividend rights, dividend rates, liquidation preferences, conversion rights, redemption rights, including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices, and other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock. in addition, delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. these provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders.

we own an approximate 79 percent interest in altus, which holds substantially all of our former gathering, processing and transmission assets in alpine high. altus may be subject to different risks than those described in this form 10-k.
we own an approximate 79 percent interest in altus, which holds substantially all of our former gathering, processing and transmission assets in alpine high. altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to service apache's production from its alpine high resource play. altus primarily generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing and transportation services. given the nature of its business, altus may be subject to different and additional risks than those described in this form 10-k.  for a description of these risks, please refer to the form 10-k filed by altm.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations apache corporation, a delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids (ngl). apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the u.s., egypt, and offshore the u.k. in the north sea (north sea). apache also has exploration interests in suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k, and the risk factors and related information set forth in part i, item 1a and part ii, item 7a of this form 10-k.
overview of 2018 results apache's mission is to grow in an innovative, safe, environmentally responsible, and profitable manner for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders. apache is focused on rigorous portfolio management, disciplined financial structure, and optimization of returns. the company primarily focused its 2018 capital program on developing alpine high, building associated alpine high infrastructure, and increasing production and performance in its other permian basin plays.
apache's u.s. assets are complemented by its international assets in egypt and the north sea, each of which adds to the company's deep inventory of exploration and development opportunities and generates cash flows in excess of current capital investments, facilitating the company's ability to develop alpine high while maintaining financial flexibility.
in november 2018 the company completed a transaction with kayne anderson acquisition corp. to create a publicly traded, pure-play, permian basin to gulf coast midstream c-corporation anchored by apache's gathering, processing, and transmission assets at alpine high with ownership or options for participation in five joint venture pipelines. this strategic transaction facilitates funding the capital intensive midstream infrastructure and enhances the allocation of apache's capital to further development of the vast alpine high upstream resource base, while maintaining control and a significant stake in the contributed assets. for further information regarding this transaction, please see "operational highlights" below, and also refer to note 2-acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
during 2018, apache reported net income attributable to common stock of $40 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, compared to $1.3 billion, or $3.41 per share in 2017. the 2018 results include asset impairments of $511 million as the company continues to redirect capital from non-core assets and a $94 million charge for early extinguishment of debt. these charges directly impact comparability to the prior year and partially offset realized benefits from higher average crude oil and ngl prices and production. additionally, 2017 results were materially benefited from a $627 million gain on asset sales.
daily production in 2018 averaged 466 mboe/d, an increase of 2 percent from 2017. excluding asset divestitures, apache's worldwide equivalent daily production increased 9 percent, driven primarily by activity in the permian basin. realized oil prices in 2018 were considerably higher than the previous year, particularly dated brent, which has provided increased operating cash flow to reinvest in the company's core development areas.
apache generated $3.8 billion in cash from operating activities in 2018, up $1.3 billion from the prior year, $628 million of cash proceeds from the sale of a noncontrolling interest in its alpine high midstream assets, and an additional $138 million of cash proceeds from non-core asset and leasehold divestments. apache ended the year with $714 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $954 million from year-end 2017. apache continuously monitors changes in its operating environment and has the ability, with its dynamic capital allocation process, to adjust the company's capital investment program to levels commensurate with cash from operating activities and to maximize value for apache's shareholders over the long term. during the year, the company took several steps to improve its debt portfolio, issuing $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and concurrently repurchasing $731 million in aggregate principal amount of certain outstanding notes. these transactions extended debt maturities, reduced the company's cost of debt, modernized its standard indenture terms, and, in conjunction with the repayment of $550 million of debt that matured during 2018, reduced debt by $281 million from 2017 year-end levels. in late 2018, the company re-initiated share repurchase activity under its existing authorization and repurchased over 7.8 million shares. since the inception of the program in 2013, the company has purchased approximately 40 million shares through the end of 2018. the company also obtained authorization from the company's board of directors to purchase an additional 40 million shares of the company's common stock.

operational highlights key operational highlights for the year include:
united states
•   u.s. onshore production averaged 256 mboe/d, up 28 percent relative to 2017, reflecting the success of the midland basin drilling program and the continued production ramp-up at alpine high.
•   the permian region averaged 17 operated rigs during the year, drilling 284 gross wells. approximately 43 percent of the region's production is crude oil and 21 percent is ngls. combined, this represents 44 percent of apache's worldwide liquids production for 2018. the region averaged 211 mboe/d and contributed $2.7 billion of revenues during 2018. fourth-quarter 2018 production increased 33 percent from the comparative 2017 quarter, a reflection of the success of the midland basin drilling program and the continued production ramp-up at alpine high.
•   in the fourth quarter of 2018, the company completed the previously announced agreement with kayne anderson acquisition corp. (kaac) and its then wholly-owned subsidiary altus midstream lp (collectively, altus). subsequent to the transaction, kaac was renamed to altus midstream company (altm).
◦   upon closing of the transaction, kaac contributed approximately $628 million of cash, net of transaction expenses, into altus midstream lp. the cash will primarily be used to fund future development of the alpine high midstream assets.
◦   in exchange for the contribution of its alpine high midstream assets, apache received an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in altus.
◦   altus owns gas gathering, processing, and transmission assets in the permian basin of west texas, anchored by midstream contracts to service apache's production from its alpine high resource play. altus primarily generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transportation services. additionally, altus midstream lp and/or its subsidiaries have equity ownership in third-party pipeline projects and hold options to purchase equity ownerships in other pipeline projects in the region.
international
•   the egypt region averaged 12 rigs and drilled or participated in drilling 115 gross wells. during 2018, egypt's gross production and net equivalent production averaged 336 mboe/d and 149 mboe/d, respectively. egypt's gross production increased 1 percent from 2017, while net equivalent production decreased 8 percent from 2017, primarily the result of the impact of higher brent oil prices on cost recovery volumes as a function of the company's production sharing contracts. the region contributed $2.7 billion of revenues during the year.
•   the north sea region averaged 3 rigs during 2018, drilling 10 gross wells. during the year, the region averaged production of 56 mboe/d and contributed $1.3 billion of revenues. production declined 3 percent from 2017, primarily the result of natural decline offset by a development well coming online at the callater field and initial production at garten during the fourth quarter of 2018.

acquisition and divestiture activity over apache's 60-year history, the company has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. a key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize apache's portfolio of assets in response to these changes. most recently, apache has completed a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and enhance apache's portfolio in order to allocate resources to more impactful exploration and development opportunities. these divestments comprised primarily capital intensive projects and assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near-term, and included all of apache's operations in canada and australia. these divestments include:
•   u.s. and north sea divestitures during 2018, in addition to the altus transaction discussed above, apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets, primarily leasehold acreage in the u.s. and north sea regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of approximately $138 million.
•   canadian operations on june 30, 2017, apache completed the sale of its canadian assets at midale and house mountain for total cash proceeds of approximately $228 million. in august of 2017, apache completed the sale of its remaining canadian operations for cash proceeds of approximately $478 million.
29
•   u.s. leasehold divestitures during 2017, apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets, primarily leasehold acreage in the permian and midcontinent/gulf coast regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $798 million.
•   north sea gathering transportation and processing (gtp) facility in november 2017, apache completed the sale of its 30.28 percent interest in the sage gas plant and its 60.56 percent interest in the beryl pipeline in the north sea to ancala midstream acquisitions limited. a refundable deposit of $134 million was received in the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with this transaction, and was recorded in "other current liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016. in november 2017, apache completed the sale and the liability related to the refundable deposit was released. no additional proceeds were received.

nm - not meaningful crude oil prices a substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the company's control. average realized crude oil prices for 2018 were up 27 percent compared to 2017, a direct result of the rising benchmark oil prices over the past year. crude oil prices realized in 2018 averaged $65.30 per barrel.
continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. while the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction.
natural gas prices natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. our primary markets include north america, egypt, and the u.k. an overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:
•   north america has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. our u.s. regions averaged $2.12 per mcf in 2018, down from $2.56 per mcf in 2017.
•   in egypt, our gas is sold to egyptian general petroleum corporation (egpc), primarily under an industry pricing formula indexed to dated brent crude oil with a minimum gas price of $1.50 per mmbtu and a maximum gas price of $2.65 per mmbtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. overall, the region averaged $2.84 per mcf in 2018, up 1 percent from the prior year.
33
•   natural gas from the north sea beryl field is processed through the sage gas plant. the gas is sold to a third party at the st. fergus entry point of the national grid on a national balancing point index price basis. the region averaged $7.33 per mcf in 2018, a 32 percent increase from an average of $5.54 per mcf in 2017.
ngl prices apache's ngl production is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
crude oil revenues
2018 vs. 2017 crude oil revenues for 2018 totaled $5.8 billion, a $1.2 billion increase from the 2017 total of $4.6 billion, primarily a result of 27 percent higher average realized prices. average daily production in 2018 was 245.4 mb/d, with prices averaging $65.30 per barrel. crude oil accounted for 80 percent of apache's 2018 oil and gas production revenues and 53 percent of its worldwide production.
worldwide crude oil production increased 1.1 mb/d compared to 2017, primarily the result of the drilling program in the permian region offset by the canada divestitures and natural decline.
2017 vs. 2016 crude oil revenues for 2017 totaled $4.6 billion, a $426 million increase from the 2016 total of $4.2 billion. an 11 percent decrease in average daily production reduced 2017 revenues by $559 million compared to 2016, while 24 percent higher average realized prices increased revenues by $985 million. average daily production in 2017 was 244.3 mb/d, with prices averaging $51.46 per barrel. crude oil accounted for 78 percent of apache's 2017 oil and gas production revenues and 53 percent of its worldwide production.
worldwide crude oil production decreased 31.0 mb/d compared to 2016, primarily the result of the canada divestitures and natural decline.
natural gas revenues
2018 vs. 2017 natural gas revenues for 2018 totaled $919 million, a $40 million decrease from the 2017 total of $959 million. a 1 percent increase in average production increased 2018 revenues by $7 million compared to 2017, while 5 percent lower average realized prices decreased revenues by $47 million. average daily production in 2018 was 966 mmcf/d, with prices averaging $2.61 per mcf. natural gas accounted for 12 percent of apache's 2018 oil and gas production revenues and 34 percent of its worldwide production.
worldwide gas production increased 8.0 mmcf/d compared to 2017, primarily the result of the alpine high development partially offset by the canada divestitures and natural decline.
2017 vs. 2016 natural gas revenues for 2017 totaled $959 million, an $8 million decrease from the 2016 total of $967 million. a 13 percent decrease in average production reduced 2017 revenues by $148 million compared to 2016, while 14 percent higher average realized prices increased revenues by $140 million. average daily production in 2017 was 958 mmcf/d, with prices averaging $2.74 per mcf. natural gas accounted for 16 percent of apache's 2017 oil and gas production revenues and 35 percent of its worldwide production.
worldwide gas production decreased 145.0 mmcf/d compared to 2016, primarily the result of the canada divestitures, maintenance activities in the north sea, and natural decline.
ngl revenues
2018 vs. 2017 ngl revenues for 2018 totaled $583 million, a $253 million increase from 2017. an 11 percent increase in average production increased 2018 revenues by $59 million compared to 2017, while 59 percent higher average realized prices increased revenues by $194 million. average daily production in 2018 was 59.6 mb/d, with prices averaging $26.87 per barrel. ngls accounted for nearly 8 percent of apache's 2018 oil and gas production revenues and 13 percent of its worldwide production.

altus revenues apache is the largest single owner of the voting common stock of altm, and has an approximate 79 percent interest in altus. altus generates revenue primarily by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transportation services. altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the permian basin of west texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to service apache's production from its alpine high resource play, which commenced production in may 2017. the amount and pace of upstream development activity by apache of its alpine high play will impact altus's aggregate gathering and processing volumes over time. additionally, other producers are also developing oil and gas plays in surrounding areas that are expected to provide attractive opportunities to enter into third-party processing and gathering agreements.
during 2018 and 2017, midstream services revenues totaling $77 million and $15 million, respectively, were generated through fee-based contractual arrangements with apache and eliminated upon consolidation. altus did not generate any services revenues in 2016.
operating expenses the table below presents a comparison of the company's expenses on an absolute dollar basis. the company's discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on context. all operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in egypt and altm. operating expenses for all periods exclude discontinued operations in australia.

lease operating expenses (loe)
loe includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. they directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. oil, which contributed more than half of apache's 2018 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.
during 2018, loe increased $55 million, or 4 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2017. on a per-unit basis, loe increased $0.19, or 2 percent compared to 2017, from $8.28 per boe to $8.47 per boe. the increase in both absolute dollar basis and per-unit basis is primarily a result of rising costs commensurate with higher commodity prices realized during 2018. during 2017, loe decreased $110 million, or 7 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2016. on a per-unit basis, loe increased $0.43, or 5 percent, compared to 2016. the per-barrel increase during 2017 is primarily the result of declines in production combined with generally rising costs commensurate with higher commodity prices realized during 2017.

2018 vs. 2017  gtp costs increased $153 million from 2017. upstream transmission and processing costs increased from $1.16 per boe in 2017 to $2.16 per boe in 2018. the increase is primarily the result of the reclassification of certain transportation charges from revenues to gtp expense as a result of the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting rules effective january 1, 2018, as well as the ramp-up of midstream operations at alpine high, partially offset by apache's exit from canada.
2017 vs. 2016  gtp costs decreased $5 million from 2016. the decrease was directly related to the canadian divestitures that closed in august 2017.
taxes other than income taxes other than income primarily consist of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state waters off the coast of the u.s. and ad valorem taxes on properties in the u.s. severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues. we are also subject to a variety of other taxes, including u.s. franchise taxes.
2018 vs. 2017  taxes other than income totaled $215 million, an increase of $64 million from 2017. the increase is primarily a result of severance taxes being impacted by higher production in the permian region and higher commodity prices during 2018 compared to 2017.
2017 vs. 2016  taxes other than income totaled $151 million in 2017, an increase of $25 million from 2016. the increase is primarily a result of higher commodity prices during 2017 compared to 2016.
exploration expense exploration expense includes unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expense, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. the following table presents a summary of these expenses:
for the year ended december 31,
2018                2017                2016
(in millions)

total exploration expense                   $503                $549                $473
2018 vs. 2017 unproved leasehold impairments decreased $32 million and dry hole expense decreased $46 million compared to 2017, primarily related to higher exploratory well success rates compared to the prior year. delay rentals and other exploration lease maintenance costs trended higher in 2018 to preserve key acreage holdings, reflecting the increase in "exploration overhead and other."
36
2017 vs. 2016 unproved leasehold impairments decreased $26 million compared to 2016, primarily a result of stabilized commodity and leasehold prices during 2017. dry hole expense increased $102 million compared to 2016, primarily related to unsuccessful international offshore exploration.
general and administrative (g&a) expenses
2018 vs. 2017  g&a expenses increased $36 million, or 9 percent, from 2017. the increase in g&a expense was primarily related to higher incentive and stock-based compensation in 2018 compared to 2017, slightly offset by the canadian divestitures during 2017.
2017 vs. 2016 g&a expenses decreased $15 million, or 4 percent, from 2016. the decrease in g&a expense was primarily related to lower incentive compensation in 2017 compared to 2016, and the canadian divestitures.
transaction, reorganization, and separation costs apache recorded $28 million, $16 million and $39 million of expenses during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, primarily related to company reorganization, including separation costs, investment banking fees and other associated costs. the charges for 2018 include $22 million for consulting and legal fees related to divestitures and the altus transaction and $6 million related to employee separation and other reorganization efforts.
depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a)
2018 vs. 2017 oil and gas property dd&a expense of $2.3 billion in 2018 increased $129 million compared to 2017. the company's oil and gas property dd&a rate increased $0.55 per boe in 2018 compared to 2017, from $12.78 to $13.33. the primary factor driving higher absolute dollar expense was an increase in capital spending primarily in the permian and alpine high regions as a result of drilling and development activity. the increase on an absolute dollar basis was partially offset by the sale of apache's canadian operations. gtp depreciation increased $10 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily a result of capital spending on altus infrastructure. other asset depreciation decreased $14 million compared to 2017 as a result of the canadian divestiture.
2017 vs. 2016 oil and gas property dd&a expense of $2.1 billion in 2017 decreased $324 million compared to 2016. the company's oil and gas property dd&a rate decreased $0.14 to $12.78 per boe in 2017 compared to 2016. the primary factor driving lower absolute dollar expense was a decrease in production volumes from the comparative prior-year periods. other asset depreciation decreased $18 million compared to 2016 primarily related to canadian divestitures.
impairments during 2018, the company recorded asset impairments totaling $511 million in connection with fair value assessments, including $328 million for oil and gas proved properties in the u.s. and egypt, $56 million impairment of a gathering and processing facility in oklahoma, $113 million for the impairment of an equity method investment based on a negotiated sales price, a $10 million impairment on the carrying values of the associated capitalized exploratory well costs related to the sale of unproved properties in the north sea, and $4 million for inventory write-downs.
during 2017, the company recorded asset impairments in connection with fair value assessments totaling $8 million for a u.k. petroleum revenue tax (prt) decommissioning asset that is no longer expected to be realizable from future abandonment activities in the north sea.
during 2016, the company recorded asset impairments totaling $1.1 billion in connection with fair value assessments, including $486 million for the impairment of the recoverable value of the prt decommissioning asset, $427 million impairments of oil and gas proved properties in the u.s. and canada, $135 million impairments of certain gtp facilities in the north sea, and $55 million for inventory write-downs.

2018 vs. 2017 net financing costs increased $81 million from 2017. the increase is primarily related to a $94 million loss on extinguishment of debt, an increase of $3 million in interest income, a decrease of $7 million in capitalized interest, and a decrease of $16 million in interest expense.
2017 vs. 2016  net financing costs decreased $20 million from 2016. the decrease is primarily related to an increase of $11 million in interest income, an increase of $3 million in capitalized interest, and a decrease of $7 million in interest expense.
provision for income taxes the 2018 income tax expense totaled $672 million. during 2018, apache's effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act (the act) and an increase in the company's valuation allowance.
on december 22, 2017, the act was signed into law. in addition to reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1, 2018, certain provisions in the act move the u.s. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income. the new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. as a result of the enacted legislation, taxpayers were required to include in taxable income for the tax year ending december 31, 2017, the pro rata share of deferred income of each specified foreign corporation with respect to which the taxpayer is a u.s. shareholder. in 2017, the company recorded a $419 million provisional deferred tax expense attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings required under the act.
also on december 22, 2017, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 (sab 118) which provides guidance for the application of accounting standards codification (asc) topic 740, income taxes, for the income tax effects of the act. sab 118 provides a measurement period which should not extend beyond one year of the enactment date of the act. in 2018, the company recorded an additional $103 million deferred tax expense attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. this deferred tax expense combined with the provisional amount recorded in 2017 were fully offset by available foreign tax credits. the company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the act in the fourth quarter of 2018.
38
the 2017 income tax benefit totaled $585 million. during 2017, apache's effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the decrease in deferred taxes associated with its investments in foreign subsidiaries, gains on the sale of oil and gas properties, the increase in the company's valuation allowance, and a decrease in the u.s. corporate income tax rate causing a remeasurement of the company's deferred tax asset.
the 2016 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $442 million. during 2016, apache's effective tax rate was impacted primarily by non-cash impairments of the carrying value of the company's oil and gas properties, non-cash impairments of the company's prt decommissioning asset, the impact of the change in u.k. statutory income tax rate, and an increase in the amount of valuation allowances on u.s. and canadian deferred tax assets.
in 2016, the u.k. government enacted finance bill 2016, which provides income tax relief to exploration and production (e&p) companies operating in the north sea through a reduction of the supplementary charge from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective january 1, 2016. as a result of the enacted legislation in the third quarter of 2016, the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $238 million related to the remeasurement of the company's december 31, 2015, u.k. deferred income tax liability.
apache recorded a full valuation allowance against its u.s. net deferred tax assets. apache will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on its u.s. net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance.
for additional information regarding income taxes, please refer to note 8-income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
capital and operational outlook apache currently plans to invest $2.4 billion in its upstream oil and gas activities in 2019, of which 70 to 75 percent will be allocated within the united states. apache's planned upstream capital investment excludes a one-third noncontrolling interest of capital investment in egypt for its share of operations. apache's $2.4 billion upstream investment plan represents an approximately 22 percent reduction compared to 2018 levels, as well as a significant reduction from the company's previous 2019 investment guidance. the revised capital outlook was in response to the rapid fourth quarter 2018 decline in oil prices and apache's decision to lower its u.s. rig count. with this and other activity reductions, apache believes the current upstream capital spending for the first quarter of 2019 will underpin its efforts to achieve the full-year capital target.
despite the significant decrease in planned capital spending, production growth will continue as the company benefits from productivity and efficiency gains in its core areas. apache projects fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2019 production growth rates of 6 to 10 percent, adjusted for the noncontrolling interest in egypt and tax volumes. the company expects 12 to 16 percent growth for its u.s. regions. approximately five percent growth is expected to be permian basin oil, which is driven by a continued focus in apache's core wildfire, powell and azalea development fields. as the result of reduced rig activity in the alpine high play, the company's new 2019 alpine high production volume outlook is 85 to 90 mboe per day on average for the year. apache's drilling focus will shift away from dry gas drilling to a higher percentage of rich gas development, primarily in the northern flank of the field. with expected cryogenic processing capacity being brought on-line throughout the second half of 2019, the company believes significant uplift in cash margins should be realized.
over the same time period, forecasts show a shallow decline rate for the international regions given planned investment levels. egypt and the north sea operations, however, are anticipated to continue generating cash flow in excess of capital investments. the north sea will maintain a similar activity set to the prior year. egypt activity will focus on advancing a large-scale seismic shoot and prospect identification program. the region will also be drilling exploration and delineation wells in each of its new concession areas, thereby establishing a foundation for potential growth.
assuming wti oil prices in the $50 to $55 per barrel range, apache anticipates an upstream capital program of $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion in 2020 and 2021. management believes this investment level is capable of generating continued production growth, with the u.s. as the primary driver.
apache also anticipates additional investments in the continued capital development of the assets of altus of approximately $325 million in 2019, approximately $185 million in 2020, and approximately $200 million in 2021. the investment will primarily be directed toward the construction of additional gathering, compression, processing, and transmission facilities, including three forecasted cryogenic processing plants expected to be in service during 2019 with combined nameplate capacity of approximately 600 mmcf/d. additional capacity will be added over the next several years to facilitate production increases from alpine high and potential third-party volumes. cash from the altus transaction and future altm and/or altus midstream lp financing activities are expected to fund future development of the altus assets.

additionally, altus midstream lp and/or its subsidiaries obtained the right, but not the obligation, to exercise options to acquire equity interests in five separate joint venture pipelines (pipeline options). the option to enter into a 15 percent ownership stake in the gulf coast express pipeline llc (gcx) natural gas pipeline was exercised in december 2018 for $91 million. apache anticipates altus midstream lp and/or its subsidiaries to exercise the remaining four pipeline options in 2019 and early 2020. assuming each pipeline option is exercised, approximately $1.6 billion of total capital spending by altus midstream lp and/or its subsidiaries is estimated for the exercise of these remaining options and the associated capital requirements expected to be incurred until the associated pipelines are in service. this includes approximately $1.3 billion in 2019 and approximately $340 million in 2020. the following table provides additional information regarding the exercise of the pipeline options:
epic option(1)     salt creek option                     shin oak option   permian highway option(2)
expiration date               february 1, 2019   january 31, 2020    60 days following in-service date   september 4, 2019

estimated exercise price(3)   $52 million        $51 million                              $500 million   $232 million
(1)   subsequent to the balance sheet date, the epic option was exercised on february 1, 2019 and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.
(2)   upon exercise of the permian highway pipeline option, altus midstream lp may acquire an additional 1 percent interest in gcx.
(3)   estimated exercise price represents altus midstream lp's proportionate share of capital expenditures made with respect to the applicable project prior to such exercise, plus financing charges associated with such capital expenditures (exercise price). there are no costs associated with exercising the options other than the exercise price. however, altus midstream lp and/or its subsidiaries will be required to fund its pro rata share of capital expenditures after the exercise date.
capital resources and liquidity operating cash flows are the company's primary source of liquidity. we may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.
apache's operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, as well as costs and sales volumes. significant changes in commodity prices impact apache's revenues, earnings and cash flows. these changes potentially impact apache's liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices. historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short term.
apache's long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of apache's drilling program and our ability to add reserves economically. changes in commodity prices also impact estimated quantities of proved reserves.
apache believes the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to the company, combined with proactive measures to adjust its capital budget to reflect volatile commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including apache's capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

(1)   the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts may differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals.
net cash provided by continuing operating activities operating cash flows are the company's primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short-term and the long-term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. the factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as dd&a, asset retirement obligation (aro) accretion, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, and deferred income tax expense.
net cash provided by continuing operating activities for 2018 totaled $3.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from 2017. the increase primarily reflects higher commodity prices during 2018 compared to 2017.
for a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see "results of operations" in this item 7. for additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses that do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the statement of consolidated cash flows in the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
altus transaction and asset divestitures in november 2018, apache and kaac completed a previously announced transaction to create a pure-play, permian basin to gulf coast midstream c-corporation. upon close, kaac changed its name to altus midstream company (altm) and contributed approximately $628 million of cash, net of transaction expenses, into its then wholly-owned subsidiary altus midstream lp. apache contributed its alpine high midstream assets into altus midstream lp in exchange for an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in altm and altus midstream lp (collectively, altus). apache fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of altus. cash from the altus transaction and future altm and/or altus midstream lp financing activities are expected to fund future development of the altus assets.
41
also during 2018, 2017, and 2016, apache recorded proceeds from divestitures totaling $138 million, $1.4 billion, and $134 million, respectively. for information regarding the company's acquisitions and divestitures, please see note 2-acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
fixed-rate debt borrowings in august 2018, apache closed an offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 4.375% notes due october 15, 2028. the notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at apache's option, subject to a make-whole premium. the net proceeds from the sale of the notes of $992 million were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers, repay notes that matured in september 2018, and for general corporate purposes.
capital expenditures and equity interest during 2018, 2017, and 2016, capital spending for exploration and development (e&d) activities totaled $3.2 billion, $2.1 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively. apache's e&d capital spending was focused primarily in its north american onshore regions. apache's investment in gas gathering, transmission, and processing (gtp) facilities totaled $581 million, $530 million, and $158 million during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
gtp expenditures over the past three years are nearly all comprised of investments in midstream infrastructure for the alpine high play, which were subsequently contributed to altus midstream lp upon closing of the altus transaction.
apache also completed leasehold and property acquisitions for cash totaling $133 million, $178 million, and $181 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. acquisition investments continued to focus on adding new leasehold positions to our north american onshore portfolio.
on december 19, 2018, altus midstream lp exercised its option to acquire a 15 percent equity interest in gulf coast express pipeline llc (gcx), a delaware limited liability company, for total cash consideration of $91 million. gcx is a long-haul natural gas pipeline that is expected to be operational and in-service in the fourth quarter of 2019. apache will consolidate this joint venture equity interest through altm.
payments on fixed-rate debt in august 2018, the company closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes. apache accepted for purchase $731 million aggregate principal amount of notes for approximately $828 million, which included principal, the discount to par, and an early tender premium totaling $820 million, as well as accrued and unpaid interest of $8 million. the company recorded a net loss of $94 million on extinguishment of debt, including $5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount, in connection with the note purchases. apache also made repayments of current year note maturities totaling $550 million during 2018.
dividends the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 54 consecutive years through 2018. future dividend payments will depend on the company's level of earnings, financial requirements, and other relevant factors. common stock dividends paid during 2018 totaled $382 million, compared with $380 million in 2017 and $379 million in 2016.
egypt noncontrolling interest sinopec international petroleum exploration and production corporation (sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in apache's oil and gas business in egypt. apache made cash distributions totaling $345 million, $265 million, and $293 million to sinopec in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
shares repurchased in 2013 and 2014, apache's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 40 million shares of the company's common stock. shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. the company initiated the buyback program on june 10, 2013, and through december 31, 2018, had repurchased a total of 40 million shares at an average price of $79.18 per share. during 2018, the company repurchased a total of 7.8 million shares at an average price of $38.99 per share. during the fourth quarter of 2018, the company's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 40 million additional shares of the company's common stock. the company is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares.

cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2018, apache had $714 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $450 million was held by altus. the majority of the cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
debt at december 31, 2018, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes and debentures, totaled $8.2 billion, of which, $150 million matures in 2019, $393 million matures in 2021, $687 million matures in 2022, and the remaining matures in years 2023 through 2096. at december 31, 2018, $150 million of 7.625% senior notes due july 1, 2019 is classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
on august 23, 2018, apache closed an offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 4.375% notes due october 15, 2028. the notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at apache's option, subject to a make-whole premium. the net proceeds from the sale of the notes of $992 million were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers, repay notes that matured in september 2018, and for general corporate purposes.
in august 2017, the company assumed the obligations of apache finance canada corporation (afcc) in respect of $300 million 7.75% notes due in 2029, which afcc issued and the company guaranteed pursuant to the governing indenture. the assumption was permitted by the indenture and effected pursuant to a supplemental indenture thereto. as a result of the assumption, the company is the obligor under the notes and indenture, and afcc is released from its obligations thereunder. the $300 million 7.75% notes historically have been included in the company's long-term debt; accordingly, the assumption did not change the company's long-term debt or total debt.
available credit facilities in march 2018, apache entered into a revolving credit facility that matures in march 2023 (subject to apache's two, one-year extension options) with commitments totaling $4.0 billion. apache can increase commitments up to $5.0 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. the facility includes a letter of credit subfacility of up to $3.0 billion, of which $2.08 billion was committed as of december 31, 2018. the facility is for general corporate purposes and committed borrowing capacity fully supports apache's commercial paper program. letters of credit are available for security needs, including in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various north sea acquisitions. as of december 31, 2018, letters of credit aggregating approximately £112.5 million and no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. in february 2019, £109.4 million of these outstanding letters of credit no longer were required and were terminated.
at apache's option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2018 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the london inter-bank offered rate (libor), plus a margin. apache also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. the margins and the facility fee vary based upon apache's senior long-term debt rating. at december 31, 2018, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, the libor margin was 1.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent. a commission is payable quarterly to lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the libor margin then in effect. customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.
the financial covenants of the 2018 credit facility require apache to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. for purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after june 30, 2015. at december 31, 2018, apache's debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 30 percent.
43
the 2018 facility's negative covenants restrict the ability of apache and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry; liens securing debt incurred to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, or capital lease of assets, provided that such debt, when incurred, does not exceed the subject purchase price and costs, as applicable, and related expenses; liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the united states and canada; and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics' liens. apache also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15 percent of apache's consolidated net tangible assets, or approximately $2.9 billion as of december 31, 2018. negative covenants also restrict apache's ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
in november 2018, altus midstream lp, an indirectly controlled subsidiary of apache, entered into a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes that matures in november 2023 (subject to altus midstream lp's two, one-year extension options). the agreement for this facility provides aggregate commitments from a syndicate of banks of $450 million until (i) the consolidated net income of altus midstream lp and its restricted subsidiaries, as adjusted pursuant to the agreement, for three consecutive calendar months equals or exceeds $175 million on an annualized basis and (ii) altus midstream lp has raised at least $250 million of additional capital (such period, the "initial period"). following the initial period, the aggregate commitments equal $800 million. all aggregate commitments include a letter of credit subfacility of up to $100 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to $100 million. after the initial period, altus midstream lp may increase commitments up to an aggregate $1.5 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. as of december 31, 2018, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under this facility.
the altus midstream lp credit facility is unsecured and is not guaranteed by apache or any of apache's other subsidiaries.
there are no clauses in either the agreement for apache's 2018 credit facility or for altus midstream lp's 2018 credit facility that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. these agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. however, each agreement allows the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if a borrower or any of its subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments under the applicable agreement if apache or altus midstream lp, as applicable, undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. each of apache and altus midstream lp was in compliance with the terms of its 2018 credit facility as of december 31, 2018.
there is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to apache or altus midstream lp will not deteriorate. we closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups. having large bank groups allows the company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank's failure to honor its lending commitment.
commercial paper program as of december 31, 2018, apache has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program which, subject to market availability, facilitates apache borrowing funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. the commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under apache's 2018 $4.0 billion committed credit facility. if apache is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, apache's 2018 committed credit facility, which matures in 2023, is available as a 100 percent backstop. as of december 31, 2018, apache had no borrowings under its commercial paper program.
off-balance sheet arrangements apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in "contractual obligations" in this item 7. other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.

(4)   amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. these include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, ngl processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. includes amounts related to firm transportation capacity on the gulf coast express pipeline project (gcx project), expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the permian highway pipeline project, expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2020 (refer to delivery commitments disclosure in part i, items 1 and 2 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information regarding fixed sales contracts related to these pipelines). amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable.
(5)   amounts include long-term lease payments for office space, aircraft, supply and standby vessels, land leases, and equipment related to exploration, development, and production activities.
as further described above under "capital and operational outlook," altus midstream lp and/or its subsidiaries have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise options to acquire equity interest in third-party joint venture pipelines. upon exercising each individual option, altus midstream lp and/or its subsidiaries may be required to fund future capital expenditures for its equity interest share in the development of the pipeline as referenced. in december 2018, altus midstream lp exercised its option for a 15 percent equity interest in the gcx pipeline and estimates it will incur approximately $175 million of additional capital contributions during 2019 for its associated interest with the remaining construction costs.
apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. apache's management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $4 million for environmental remediation and approximately $35 million for various contingent legal liabilities. for a detailed discussion of the company's environmental and legal contingencies, please see note 9-commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
in addition to our recorded environmental and legal liabilities, we have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the gulf of mexico where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. if a purchaser of our gulf of mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. in such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.

with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) has issued a notice to lessees (ntl no. 2016-n01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies' oil and gas leases. while requirements under the ntl have not yet been fully implemented by boem, the ntl will likely require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to apache's current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases. we are working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the ntl. additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership. such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties' solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.
insurance program we maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, general liabilities, workers' compensation, employers' liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that we must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. additionally, our insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. there is no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.
our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide up to $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. these policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage. coverage for gulf of mexico named windstorms is excluded from this coverage.
our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide approximately $500 million in coverage, scaled to apache's interest. our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify apache for injuries and death of the service provider's employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.
apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the overseas private investment corporation (opic) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. the islamic corporation for the insurance of investment and export credit (iciec, an agency of the islamic development bank) reinsures opic. in the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage to apache, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $1 billion.
apache has an additional insurance policy with opic, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides up to $300 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by egpc of arbitral awards covering amounts owed apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of egypt prevent apache from exporting our share of production. the multilateral investment guarantee agency (miga), a member of the world bank group, provides $150 million in reinsurance to opic.
future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. in addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable.
critical accounting policies and estimates apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of apache's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. the following is a discussion of apache's most critical accounting policies.
reserves estimates proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.
46
proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. for example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd&a expense. a material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.
reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.
apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.
purchase price allocation accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company's assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.
when estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the company must apply various assumptions. the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. to estimate the fair values of these properties, the company prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in "reserve estimates" of this item 7. estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future.
oil and gas exploration costs apache accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. on a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts. if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations. otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
long-lived assets long-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach.
47
under the income approach, the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, discount rates, and other variables. key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. we discount the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants.
to assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, when available we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets. this requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums.
although we base the fair value estimate of each asset group on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the asset group, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.
over the past several years, the company has experienced substantial volatility in commodity prices, which impacted our future development plans and operating cash flows. as such, we recorded impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, transmission, and processing facilities in 2018 and 2016. for discussion of these impairments, see "fair value measurements" of note 1-summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
asset retirement obligation (aro)
the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. apache's removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the north sea and gulf of mexico. estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.
aro associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. the aro liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with apache's oil and gas properties. the company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
income taxes our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. we routinely assess the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).
the company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates. the company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. these accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. the company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.

item 1a.   risk factors

we operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict.  our business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors.  in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
13
statements.  the following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance.  additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may materially adversely affect us in future periods.  you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.
if we fail to comply with the terms of the dpa that we entered into in january 2017, we may be subject to criminal prosecution and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
on january 12, 2017, we resolved previously-disclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries.  as part of the settlement, we entered into a dpa with the doj.  a copy of the dpa is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report.
if we do not comply with the terms of the dpa, we could be subject to prosecution for violating the internal controls provisions of the fcpa and the conduct of biomet and its subsidiaries described in the dpa, which conduct pre-dated our acquisition of biomet, as well as any new or continuing violations.  we could also be subject to exclusion by oig-hhs from participation in federal healthcare programs, including medicaid and medicare.  any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions.
our acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:
•   unforeseen difficulties in integrating personnel and sales forces, operations, manufacturing, logistics, research and development, information technology, communications, purchasing, accounting, marketing, administration and other systems and processes;

•   difficulties harmonizing and optimizing quality systems and operations;

•   diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;

•   unforeseen difficulties related to entering geographic regions where we do not have prior experience;

•   potential loss of key employees;

•   unforeseen liabilities associated with businesses acquired; and

•   inability to generate sufficient revenue or realize sufficient cost savings to offset acquisition or investment costs.

as a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate.  these risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions.
interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have manufacturing sites all over the world.  in some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants.  damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disaster-related events, or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the qsr and good manufacturing practice requirements, equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products.  in the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand.  in the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals.  as a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
14
disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party vendors and we outsource some key manufacturing activities.  certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.  in certain cases, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors' manufacturing processes.  a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
moreover, we are subject to the sec's rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as "conflict minerals" (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries.  this rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.  in addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products.  we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our due diligence procedures.  as a result, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders.
we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the products we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities.  the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all.  delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs.
both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations and other local, state and foreign requirements.  compliance with these requirements, including the qsr, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda and other regulators, which may result in observations (such as on form 483), and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement.  if the fda or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such products, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.  the fda or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us.  the fda or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter, a recidivist warning letter, a consent decree of permanent injunction, and/or recommend prosecution.  any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in 2012, we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain processes pertaining to products manufactured at our ponce, puerto rico manufacturing facility.  in may 2016, we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed non-conformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our facility in montreal, quebec, canada.  in august 2018, we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed non-conformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our warsaw north campus manufacturing facility.  as of february 20, 2019, these warning letters remained pending.  until the violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda as described above, the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the fda may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
15
operations.  additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
govern mental regulations outside the u.s. have and may continue to become increasingly stringent and complex.  in the eu, for example, a new medical device regulation was published in 2017 which, when it enters into full force in 2020, will include significant additional premarket and post-market requirements.  complying with the requirements of this regulation will require us to incur significant expense.  additionally, the availability of industry notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited, which may cause delays in our receipt of ce certificate approvals and eu medical device regulation submission approvals.  any such delays, or any failure to meet the requirements of the new regulation, could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements.
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the international standards organization.  if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.
if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
our industry is subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the federal false claims act, the federal anti-kickback statute, the federal stark law, the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws.  in addition, we are subject to various federal and foreign laws concerning anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters, sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations.  violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the u.s., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including medicare, medicaid and veterans administration health programs.  these laws are administered by, among others, the doj, the oig-hhs, the sec, the ofac, the bureau of industry and security of the u.s. department of commerce and state attorneys general.
we are also subject to federal, state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information.  the fda also has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices.  in addition, certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under hipaa.  hipaa governs the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by hipaa "covered entities" and their "business associates."  covered entities are health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions, health plans, and health care clearinghouses.  a business associate is any person or entity (other than members of a covered entity's workforce) that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information.  hhs (through the office for civil rights) has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with hipaa regulations.  on december 12, 2018, the office for civil rights of hhs issued a request for information seeking input from the public on how the hipaa regulations could be modified to amend existing obligations relating to the processing of protected health information.  we will monitor this process and assess the impact of changes to the hipaa regulations to our business.
in addition to the fda guidance and hipaa regulations described above, a number of u.s. states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the confidentiality, security, use and disclosure of sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, medical and financial information and other personal information.  these laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by u.s. federal laws. these state laws include the ccpa, which was signed into law on june 28, 2018 and largely takes effect january 1, 2020.  the ccpa, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about california residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information.  we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the ccpa, which has substantial penalties for non-compliance and carries significant potential liability, on our business.
outside of the u.s., data protection laws, including the gdpr, also apply to some of our operations in the countries in which we provide services to our customers.  legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve.  the gdpr imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer eu personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations
16
of up to 4% of total company revenue).  other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.
the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements.  failure to comply with u.s. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.
we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations.
we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions.  at december 31, 2018, our total indebtedness was $8.9 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion at december 31, 2014.  as of december 31, 2018, our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months are expected to be $776.9 million.  as a result of the increase in our debt, demands on our cash resources have increased.  the increased level of debt could, among other things:
•   require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•   limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•   restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;

•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

•   adversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase and our ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired;

•   adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and

•   limit our ability to apply proceeds from a future offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data, including from data breaches, our business could be adversely affected.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure.  as a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities.  we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and, as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information.  our information systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information.  in addition, given their size and complexity, these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidential information (including, but not limited to, intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information).  cyber-attacks, such as those involving the deployment of malware, are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect.  if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could:
•   lose existing customers;

•   have difficulty attracting new customers;

17
•   have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing;

•   have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud;

•   have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals;

•   have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed;

•   incur increased operating expenses;

•   incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach; or

•   suffer other adverse consequences.

while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful.  despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that cyber-attacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future.  any significant breakdown, intrusion, breach, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.
we operate in a highly competitive environment.  our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies.  to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies. competition is primarily on the basis of:
•   pricing;

•   technology;

•   innovation;

•   quality;

•   reputation; and

•   customer service.

in markets outside of the u.s., other factors influence competition as well, including:
•   local distribution systems;

•   complex regulatory environments; and

•   differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

our competitors may:
•   have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

•   respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

•   undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

•   adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

•   be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.

any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.
18
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
our marketing success in the u.s. and abroad depends significantly upon our agents' and distributors' sales and service expertise in the marketplace.  many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents' detailed knowledge of products and instruments.  a loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of:
•   evolving customer needs;

•   changing demographics;

•   slowing industry growth rates;

•   declines in the musculoskeletal implant market;

•   the introduction of new products and technologies;

•   evolving surgical philosophies; and

•   evolving industry standards.

without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time.  if that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer.  the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
•   properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

•   commercialize new products in a timely manner;

•   manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time;

•   differentiate our offerings from competitors' offerings;

•   achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

•   satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost procedures;

•   innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and

•   provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

in addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors:
•   entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

•   the need for regulatory clearance; and

•   uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production.  in addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.
19
if third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed.
we sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs.  these third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication.  third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices.
in addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.  if third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets.  if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.
the ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs.  group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization's affiliated hospitals and other members.  if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer's products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement.  our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the u.s., which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.
we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2018 from outside the u.s.  we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations.  our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:
•   changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

•   changes in foreign regulatory requirements, such as more stringent requirements for regulatory clearance of products;

•   differing local product preferences and product requirements;

•   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•   diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the u.s.;

•   trade protection measures, import or export requirements and increased tariffs that may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our operating costs;

•   foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;

•   complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

•   extraterritorial effects of u.s. laws such as the fcpa;

•   effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the uk bribery act;

•   difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

20
•   labor force instability;

•   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

•   political and economic instability.

violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
we may have additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions.  significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  we are regularly under audit by tax authorities.  although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law on december 22, 2017 (the "2017 tax act"), with significant changes to the u.s. corporate income tax system, including a federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, and the transition of u.s. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system.  although the u.s. treasury has provided guidance on aspects of the 2017 tax act, there still remains further guidance to be provided in the future.  on december 22, 2017, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118"), expressing its views on the application of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 740, income taxes, in the reporting period that includes december 22, 2017.  for the financial statements that include the reporting period in which the 2017 tax act was enacted, sab 118 provides a provisional approach to reflect the income tax effects of the 2017 tax act.  we finalized our provisional amounts for the effects of the 2017 tax act in our 2018 annual report on form 10-k.  however, our tax expense and cash flow could be impacted in the event of adverse future regulatory guidance provided by the u.s. treasury clarifying certain aspects of the 2017 tax act.
if the medical device excise tax is not repealed or further suspended, our business, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.
as part of the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010, as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 (collectively, the affordable care act or aca), in january 2013 we began paying a 2.3 percent medical device excise tax on the vast majority of our u.s sales.  a two-year moratorium was placed on the tax effective january 1, 2016, and that moratorium was extended for an additional two years effective january 1, 2018.  absent further legislative action, the tax will be automatically reinstated for u.s. medical device sales beginning january 1, 2020.  if the medical device excise tax is reinstated, we will again be forced to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the earnings impact due to the tax.  we do not expect to be able to pass along the cost of the tax to hospitals, which continue to face cuts to their medicare reimbursement under the affordable care act and other legislation.  nor do we expect to be able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from any further expansion of health insurance coverage through aca exchanges or medicaid expansion because of the demographics of the current uninsured population.  accordingly, reinstatement of the medical device excise tax could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.
a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan.  the u.s. dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.  significant increases in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen, as well as other currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.
21
pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices.  in the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients.  as discussed further in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom® acetabular component ("durom cup"), certain products within the m/l taper and m/l taper with kinectiv® technology hip stems and versys® femoral head implants, and the m2a-magnumtm hip system.  the majority of the durom cup cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation ("mdl") in the district of new jersey (in re: zimmer durom hip cup products liability litigation); the majority of the m/l taper and m/l taper with kinectiv technology hip stem cases and versys femoral head implant cases are pending in a federal mdl in the southern district of new york (in re: zimmer m/l taper hip prosthesis or m/l taper hip prosthesis with kinectiv technology and versys femoral head products liability litigation); and the majority of the m2a-magnum hip system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of indiana (in re: biomet m2a magnum hip implant products liability litigation).  we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products.  any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend.  product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.
although we maintain third-party product liability insurance coverage, we have substantial self-insured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to pay for defense costs, or to satisfy a judgment or settlement.  furthermore, even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any defense costs, settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits.  product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.
claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly.  at any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  as discussed further in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements, in 2015 we paid a compensatory damages award of approximately $90 million and in december 2018 we accrued an estimated loss of approximately $168 million related to an award of treble damages and attorneys' fees in a patent infringement lawsuit.
patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business.  we rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so.  while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents, trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property.  further, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage.  third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
in addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries.  if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property, our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue.
22
we also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation with security measures, including the use of non-disclosure and other agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators.  we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.
we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.
in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.  for example, as discussed further in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements, we are defending a purported class action lawsuit, shah v. zimmer biomet holdings, inc. et al., filed against us, certain of our current and former officers, certain current and former members of our board of directors, and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016, alleging that we and other defendants violated federal securities laws by making materially false and/or misleading statements and/or omissions about our compliance with fda regulations and our ability to continue to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate in the second half of 2016.  although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.  given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome.  we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.
future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results.
our assets include intangible assets, including goodwill.  at december 31, 2018, we had $9.6 billion in goodwill.  the goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable.  as discussed further in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $975.9 million in 2018.  if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline, we could be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges.  any write-off of a material portion of our goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.
developments relating to the uk's referendum vote in favor of leaving the eu could adversely affect us.
the uk held a referendum in june 2016 in which voters approved the uk's voluntary exit from the eu, commonly referred to as "brexit".  in march 2017, the uk formally notified the eu of its intention to withdraw, which commenced a period of up to two years for negotiating the uk's withdrawal terms.  the uk and the eu have been negotiating the terms of the uk's exit from the eu, which is scheduled for march 29, 2019.  although the uk and the eu agreed upon a draft withdrawal agreement in november 2018, the uk parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement in january 2019, creating significant uncertainty as to the terms under which the uk will leave the eu.  if the uk leaves the eu with no agreement, it will likely have an adverse impact on labor and trade and will create further short-term currency volatility.  brexit and the perceptions as to its impact have and may continue to adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in europe and globally and could contribute to instability in global fin ancial and foreign exchange markets.  brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services and people between the uk and the eu.  the future relationship for medical device products regulation and trade between the uk and the eu is currently uncertain and any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of brexit could result in significant expense and take significant time to complete.  also, as a result of brexit, other european countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the eu.
given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which we will be affected by brexit is uncertain.  any of the potential negative effects of brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
23
anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, our restated by-laws and the delaware general corporation law may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.
these provisions provide for, among other things:
•   the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without further stockholder action;

•   advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;

•   certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; and

•   the prohibition on engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for three years after the time at which a person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met, as set forth in section 203 of the delaware general corporation law.

these anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party's offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders.  as a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.
our restated by-laws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.
our restated by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the state of delaware (or, if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated by-laws, as either may be amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine.  any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions.  this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.  alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.  certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes.  certain amounts in the 2017 and 2016 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2018 presentation.
executive level overview
2018 results in december 2017, we announced the appointment of a new chief executive officer ("ceo").  after evaluating the state of our business, our ceo expects it will be a two-year (consisting of 2018 and 2019) effort to get the company operating at market level or above in terms of sales growth rates.  one of his first priorities was to improve our supply chain.  starting in 2016 and continuing into 2017, production delays at our warsaw north campus facility directly impacted our ability to fully meet demand in our knees, hips and s.e.t. product categories.  we successfully reduced backorders and increased safety stock levels in 2018 and no longer consider supply to be a barrier to delivering our financial commitments.  this resulted in improved sales growth in 2018 in our largest product categories of knees and hips.  knees and hips sales growth in 2018 was 1.5 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, compared to a sales decline in knees of 0.6 percent and sales growth of 0.5 percent in hips in 2017.  additionally, this sales growth improved in the second half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2018.  overall, net sales increased by 1.7 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the improved product supply and completion of key research and development ("r&d") projects in our knees product category.
our net earnings (loss) decreased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to $979.7 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairments and $186.0 million of litigation-related charges in 2018 compared to a $1,272.4 million income tax benefit recognized in 2017 related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("2017 tax act"). net earnings (loss) also decreased in 2018 due to increased excess and obsolescence charges and continued investments in r&d and selling, general and administrative ("sg&a").
2019 outlook
2019 will mark the second year of our two-year turnaround effort.  in late 2018 and early 2019, we had various product launches in our knees product category, which we anticipate will drive improving commercial momentum, especially in the second half of 2019.  we estimate the change in sales in 2019 compared to 2018 will be in a range of negative 0.5 percent to positive 0.5 percent.  this range includes estimated negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 1.0 percent to 1.5 percent.  we anticipate that most of the negative effects of foreign currency exchange rates will occur in the first half of the year.
assuming we have no significant goodwill and intangible asset impairments or litigation charges in 2019, we expect our net earnings to increase significantly compared to the net loss recognized in 2018.  we expect our costs of products sold will continue to reflect costs associated with our quality remediation efforts.  we anticipate continuing to make investments in operating expenses to support our new product launches.  however, we expect expenses related to our acquisition and integration activities and quality remediation will decline as we complete these projects during 2019.  we believe that our interest expense, net, will continue to decline throughout the year due to lower anticipated debt levels.
results of operations we analyze sales by three geographies, the americas, emea and asia pacific, and by the following product categories: knees, hips, s.e.t., dental, spine & cmf and other.  this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments, which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals.  we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies.

demand (volume/mix) trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 3.2 percentage points of year-over-year sales growth during 2018.  volume/mix growth was driven by recent product introductions, sales in key emerging markets and an aging population.   2017 year-over-year volume/mix growth of 4.2 percent benefited from acquisitions made in 2016 that resulted in a full year of the sales of acquired companies reflected in the 2017 results.
we believe long-term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other factors.  in addition, demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies.
pricing trends global selling prices had a negative effect of 2.4 percentage points on year-over-year sales during 2018.  in the majority of countries in which we operate, we continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems.
foreign currency exchange rates in 2018, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive effect of 0.9 percent on sales.  we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk.  changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is reduced.  if foreign currency exchange rates remain at levels consistent with recent rates, we estimate 2019 sales will be negatively affected by 1.0 percent to 1.5 percent.
sales by product category knees knee sales increased in 2018 compared to a year-over-year decline in 2017.  knee sales have improved due to recent product launches and improved supply.  knee sales volume/mix growth was led by persona the personalized knee system and the oxford partial knee.
hips hip sales continued to experience year-over-year sales growth driven primarily by volume/mix growth, which principally resulted from strong performance in our asia pacific and americas operating segments.  improved supply contributed positively to our results in the hips product category.  hip sales volume/mix growth was led by our taperloc hip system, arcos modular hip system and g7 acetabular system.

s.e.t.
our s.e.t. sales continued to increase in 2018, driven primarily by strong performance in key surgical and upper extremity brands.
dental dental sales continued to decline in 2018.  in the past few years, our dental business has been affected by ongoing competitive challenges in the u.s. and emea and restructuring of our dental organization in certain european markets.
spine & cmf spine and cmf sales continued to increase in 2018, primarily due to continuing strong sales of our thoracic products, partially offset by a decline in spine sales driven by continuing u.s. distributor integration issues.  year-over-year sales growth in 2017 benefited significantly from the full year impact of an acquisition made in 2016.

the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher excess and obsolete inventory charges, lower average selling prices and the effect of our hedging program.  we incurred hedge losses of $26.2 million in 2018 compared to hedge gains of $5.1 million in 2017.  for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings.
the increase in gross margin percentage in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in inventory step-up charges.  the reduction in inventory step-up charges resulted from the biomet inventory that was stepped-up to fair value having been fully recognized by june 30, 2016.  in 2016, we recognized significant excess and obsolete inventory charges for certain product lines we intend to discontinue, but did not recognize significant charges in 2017, resulting in improvement to our gross margin percentage.  additional favorability was driven by lower medical device excise tax expense due to the two year moratorium on the u.s. medical device excise tax and a favorable resolution on past excise taxes that were paid.  under the applicable accounting rules that we apply to the u.s. medical device excise tax, we had a portion of the tax paid prior to the moratorium included in the cost of inventory and recognized expense through the fourth quarter of 2016.  in january 2018, the moratorium on this tax was extended through december 31, 2019.  these favorable items were partially offset by lower hedge gains of $5.1 million in 2017 compared to $87.7 million in 2016 and the effect of lower average selling prices.
operating expenses r&d spending has remained generally consistent as a percentage of sales, as we continue to invest in new technologies to address unmet clinical needs.  in 2018, with tax savings resulting from the 2017 tax act, we were able to invest in r&d at a higher rate on projects such as our recent knee product launches.
sg&a expenses and sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales increased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher litigation-related charges, increased expenses related to our compliance with the dpa, increased incentive compensation due to better performance versus our operating budgets and various spending on other special business transformation initiatives.  our 2017 sg&a expenses and sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher litigation-related charges, increased freight costs due to expedited product shipments and increased investments in our specialized sales forces.
in 2018, we recognized goodwill impairment charges primarily related to our emea and spine reporting units.  in 2017, we recognized goodwill impairment charges related to our spine and office based technologies reporting units.  for more information regarding these charges, see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
32
acquisition, integration and related expenses declined in both 2017 and 2018 due to the natural regression of integration activities related to the 2015 biomet merger and other various acquisitions that were consummated in 2016.  we are nearing completion of our integration plans for these businesses.
our quality enhancement and remediation efforts began in late 2016, accelerated throughout 2017 and continued throughout 2018.  these costs primarily relate to fees paid to temporary external consultants engaged to assist in the quality remediation at our warsaw north campus facility.  we have completed many of our remediation milestones and expect quality remediation costs to continue to decline in 2019.
other expense, net, interest expense, net, and income taxes in 2018, other expense, net, was primarily related to certain components of pension expense and remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity's functional currency, partially offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate any gain or loss.  in 2017, other expense, net, primarily related to certain components of pension expense and remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity's functional currency, partially offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate any gain or loss.  in 2016, other expense, net, primarily included a $53.3 million loss on debt extinguishment.  it also included certain components of pension expense and losses on the sale of certain assets and the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entity's functional currency, offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate any gain or loss.
interest expense, net, declined in 2018 and 2017 when compared to the same prior year periods primarily due to continued debt repayments.  additionally, we implemented hedging strategies that have lowered our interest expense, net, and we extinguished higher-rate debt by issuing notes with lower interest rates.
our effective tax rate ("etr") on earnings before income taxes was negative 39.9 percent, negative 290.3 percent and positive 23.8 percent for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  in 2018, our negative etr was primarily due to goodwill impairment that resulted in us having a net loss before income taxes with no associated tax benefit recognized for this charge.  in 2018, we also recognized an additional $8.3 million of income tax provision as we completed our estimate of the effects of the 2017 tax act.  in 2017, the negative etr was driven by the provisional income tax benefit we recorded of $1,272.4 million from the 2017 tax act, as well as $111.3 million of tax benefit we recorded from lower tax rates unrelated to the impact of the 2017 tax act.  in 2016, we recognized $40.6 million of tax benefit from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities, which was partially offset by $27.6 million of additional tax provision related to finalizing the tax accounts related to the biomet merger.
absent additional discrete tax events, we expect our future etr will be lower than the u.s. corporate income tax rate of 21.0 percent, due to our mix of earnings between u.s. and foreign locations which have lower corporate income tax rates.  our etr in future periods could also potentially be impacted by changes in tax rates, tax laws or their interpretation, including the european union rules on state aid; the outcome of various federal, state and foreign audits; and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.  currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results.

non-gaap operating performance measures we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") to evaluate our operating performance.  these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step-up; certain inventory and manufacturing-related charges including charges to discontinue certain product lines; intangible asset amortization; goodwill and intangible asset impairment; acquisition, integration and related expenses; quality remediation expenses; certain litigation gains and charges; expenses to comply with the new european union medical device regulation; other charges; any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items; the effect from finalizing the tax accounts for the biomet merger; the effect of the 2017 tax act; other certain tax adjustments; and, with respect to earnings per share information, provide for the effect of dilutive shares assuming net earnings in a period of a reported net loss.  we use these non-gaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business.  additionally, we believe these non-gaap measures provide meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating our performance.  we believe these measures offer the ability to make period-to-period comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported income but that do not impact the fundamentals of our operations.  the non-gaap measures enable the evaluation of operating results and trend analysis by allowing a reader to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items that are excluded from the non-gaap measures.  in addition, adjusted diluted earnings per share is used as a performance metric in our incentive compensation programs.
our non-gaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $1,565.4 million, $1,636.4 million, and $1,610.8 million, respectively, and our non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.64, $8.03, and $7.96, respectively.

(1)   inventory step-up and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges relate to inventory step-up expense, excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines we intend to discontinue and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges. inventory step-up expense represents the incremental expense of inventory sold recognized at its fair value after business combination accounting is applied versus the expense that would have been recognized if sold at its cost to manufacture. since only the inventory that existed at the business combination date was stepped-up to fair value, we believe excluding the incremental expense provides investors useful information as to what our costs may have been if we had not been required to increase the inventory's book value to fair value. the excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines are driven by acquisitions where there are competing product lines and we have plans to discontinue one of the competing product lines.

(2)   we exclude intangible asset amortization from our non-gaap financial measures because we internally assess our performance against our peers without this amortization. due to various levels of acquisitions among our peers, intangible asset amortization can vary significantly from company to company.

(3)   in 2018, we recognized $3.8 million of intangible asset impairment from merger-related in-process research and development ("ipr&amp;d) intangible assets and a goodwill impairment charge of $975.9 million. the impairment was comprised of $401.2 million in our spine reporting unit, $567.0 million in our emea reporting unit and $7.7 million in an insignificant reporting unit. in 2017, we recognized $18.8 million and $8.0 million of intangible asset impairment from biomet merger-related ipr&amp;d and trademark intangible assets, respectively. also in 2017, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $32.7 million and $272.0 million on our office based technologies and spine reporting units, respectively. in 2016, we recognized $31.1 million of intangible asset impairment primarily from biomet merger-related ipr&amp;d intangible assets.

(4)   the acquisition, integration and related expenses we have excluded from our non-gaap financial measures resulted from our merger with biomet in 2015 and various acquisitions we consummated in 2016. for biomet, we have detailed integration roadmaps that cover a three year period from the merger date to accomplish the tasks we feel are necessary to integrate the businesses. for the various 2016 acquisitions, we also have integration plans that are necessary to integrate the businesses. the acquisition, integration and related expenses include the following types of expenses:

•   consulting and professional fees related to third-party integration consulting performed in a variety of areas, such as tax, compliance, logistics and human resources, and legal fees related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions.

•   employee termination benefits related to terminating employees with overlapping responsibilities in various areas of our business.

•   dedicated project personnel expenses which include the salary, benefits, travel expenses and other costs directly associated with employees who are 100 percent dedicated to our integration of acquired businesses and employees who have been notified of termination, but are continuing to work on transferring their responsibilities.

•   contract termination expenses related to terminated contracts, primarily with sales agents and distribution agreements.

35
•   other various expenses to relocate facilities, integrate information technology, losses incurred on assets resulting from the applicable acquisition, and other various expenses.

(5)   we are addressing inspectional observations on form 483 and a warning letter issued by the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") following its inspections of our warsaw north campus facility, among other matters. this quality remediation has required us to devote significant financial resources and is for a discrete period of time. the majority of the expenses are related to consultants who are helping us to update previous documents and redesign certain processes.

(6)   we are involved in routine patent litigation, product liability litigation, commercial litigation and other various litigation matters. we review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine if excluding the losses or gains will provide our investors with useful incremental information. litigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results. the litigation charges and gains excluded from our non-gaap financial measures in the periods presented relate to product liability matters where we have received numerous claims on specific products and intellectual property litigation. in regards to the product liability matters, due to the complexities involved and claims filed in multiple districts, the expenses associated with these matters are significant to our operating results. once the litigation matter has been excluded from our non-gaap financial measures in a particular period, any additional expenses or gains from changes in estimates are also excluded, even if they are not significant, to ensure consistency in our non-gaap financial measures from period-to-period.

(7)   the new european union medical device regulation imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements. the new regulations will require currently-approved medical devices a transition period until may 2020 to meet the additional requirements. for certain devices, this transition period can be extended until may 2024. we are excluding from our non-gaap financial measures the incremental costs incurred to comply with the regulations related to our currently-approved medical devices. the incremental costs primarily include third-party consulting necessary to supplement our internal resources.

(8)   we have incurred other various expenses from specific events or projects that we consider highly variable or have a significant impact to our operating results that we have excluded from our non-gaap financial measures. this includes legal entity and operational restructuring as well as our costs of complying with our dpa with the u.s. government related to certain fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries. under the dpa, which has a three-year term, we are subject to oversight by an independent compliance monitor, which monitorship commenced in july 2017. the excluded costs include the fees paid to the independent compliance monitor and to external legal counsel assisting in the matter.

(9)   represents the tax effects on the previously specified items. the tax effect for the u.s. jurisdiction is calculated based on an effective rate considering federal and state taxes, as well as permanent items. for jurisdictions outside the u.s., the tax effect is calculated based upon the statutory rates where the items were incurred.

(10)   the 2016 period includes negative effects from finalizing the tax accounts for the biomet merger. under the applicable u.s. gaap rules, these measurement period adjustments are recognized on a prospective basis in the period of change.

(11)   the 2017 tax act resulted in a net favorable provisional adjustment due to the reduction of deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings and revaluation of deferred tax liabilities to a 21 percent rate, which was partially offset by provisional tax charges related to the toll charge provision of the 2017 tax act. in 2018, we finalized our estimates of the effects of the 2017 tax act based upon final guidance issued by u.s. tax authorities.

(12)   other certain tax adjustments in 2018 primarily related to changes in tax rates on deferred tax liabilities recorded on intangible assets recognized in acquisition-related accounting and adjustments from internal restructuring transactions that provide us access to offshore funds in a tax efficient manner. in 2017, other certain tax adjustments relate to tax benefits from lower tax rates unrelated to the impact of the 2017 tax act, net favorable resolutions of various tax matters and net favorable adjustments from internal restructuring transactions. the 2016 adjustment primarily related to a favorable adjustment to certain deferred tax liabilities recognized as part of acquisition-related accounting and favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities offset by internal restructuring transactions that provide us access to offshore funds in a tax efficient manner.

cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,747.4 million in 2018 compared to $1,582.3 million and $1,632.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.  the increase in operating cash flows in 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by additional cash flows from our sale of accounts receivable in certain countries, lower acquisition and integration expenses and lower quality remediation expenses, as well as certain significant payments made in the 2017 period.  in the 2017 period, we made payments related to the u.s. durom cup settlement program, and we paid $30.5 million in settlement payments to resolve previously-disclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries as discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.  the decline in operating cash flows in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by additional investments in inventory, additional expenses for quality remediation and the significant payments made in the 2017 period as discussed in the previous sentence.  these unfavorable items were partially offset by $174.0 million of incremental cash flows in 2017 from our sale of accounts receivable in certain countries.
cash flows used in investing activities were $416.6 million in 2018 compared to $510.8 million and $1,691.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.  instrument and property, plant and equipment additions reflected ongoing investments in our product portfolio and optimization of our manufacturing and logistics network.  in 2018, we entered into receive-fixed-rate, pay-fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps.  our investing cash flows reflect the net cash inflows from the fixed-rate interest rate receipts/payments, as well as the termination of certain of these swaps that were in a gain position in the year.  the 2016 period included cash outflows for the acquisition of ldr holding corporation ("ldr") and other business acquisitions.  additionally, the 2016 period reflects the maturity of available-for-sale debt securities.  as these investments matured, we used the cash to pay off debt and have not reinvested in any additional debt securities.
cash flows used in financing activities were $1,302.2 million in 2018.  our primary use of available cash in 2018 was for debt repayment.  we received net proceeds of $749.5 million from the issuance of additional senior notes and borrowed $400.0 million from our multicurrency revolving facility to repay $1,150.0 million of senior notes that became due on april 2, 2018.  we subsequently repaid the $400.0 million of multicurrency revolving facility borrowings.  also in 2018, we borrowed another $675.0 million under a new u.s. term loan c and used the cash proceeds along with cash generated from operations throughout the year to repay an aggregate of $835.0 million on u.s. term loan a, $450.0 million on u.s. term loan b, and we subsequently repaid $140.0 million on u.s. term loan c.  overall, we had approximately $1,150 million of net principal repayments on our senior notes and term loans in 2018.  in 2017, our primary use of available cash was also for debt repayment compared to 2016 when we were not able to repay as much debt due to financing requirements to complete the ldr and other business acquisitions.  additionally in 2017, we had net cash inflows of $103.5 million on factoring programs that had not been remitted to the third party.  in 2018, we had net cash outflows related to these factoring programs as we remitted the $103.5 million and collected only $66.8 million which had not yet been remitted by the end of the year.  since our factoring programs started at the end of 2016, we did not have similar cash flows in that year.
in january 2019, we borrowed an additional $200.0 million under u.s. term loan c and used those proceeds, along with cash on hand, to repay the remaining $225.0 million outstanding under u.s. term loan b.
in february, may, august and december 2018, our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.24 per share.  we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.  as further discussed in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, our debt facilities restrict the payment of dividends in certain circumstances.
in february 2016, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program effective march 1, 2016, with no expiration date.  as of december 31, 2018, all $1.0 billion remained authorized for repurchase under the program.
we will continue to exercise disciplined capital allocation designed to drive stockholder value creation.  we intend to use available cash for reinvestment in the business, debt repayment and dividends.  if the right opportunities arise, we may also use available cash to pursue business development opportunities.
as discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, the internal revenue service ("irs") has issued proposed adjustments for years 2005 through 2012 reallocating profits between certain of our u.s. and foreign subsidiaries.  we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs.  although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows.
37
as discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements, as of december 31, 2018, a short-term liability of $19.5 million and a long-term liability of $72.1 million related to durom cup product liability claims were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.  we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years. we maintain insurance for product liability claims, subject to self-insurance retention requirements.  we have recovered insurance proceeds from certain of our insurance carriers for durom cup-related claims.  while we may recover additional insurance proceeds in the future for durom cup-related claims, we do not have a receivable recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2018 for any possible future insurance recoveries for these claims.  we also had a liability of $70.4 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2018 related to biomet metal-on-metal hip implant claims.  additionally, we have a liability of approximately $168 million related to the stryker patent infringement lawsuit that we may be required to pay in 2019.
at december 31, 2018, we had 12 tranches of senior notes outstanding as follows (dollars in millions):

395.4             4.450       august 15, 2045
*euro denominated debt securities we also had four term loans with total principal of $1,057.0 million outstanding as of december 31, 2018.
we have a five-year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility of $1.5 billion (the "multicurrency revolving facility") that will mature on september 30, 2021.  there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility as of december 31, 2018.  we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $55.0 million.
for additional information on our debt, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity.  we invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.
as of december 31, 2018, $386.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the u.s.  of this amount, $89.8 million is denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk.  the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.  we intend to repatriate at least $5.1 billion of unremitted earnings in future years.
management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs, as well as to return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  should additional investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.
38
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments.  the following table illustrates our contractual obligations and certain other commitments (in millions):
2020              2022               2024

$67.1 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2018 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans.  defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions.  due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2019.  therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans.  see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.
under the 2017 tax act, we have a $302.4 million toll charge liability for the one-time deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. this amount was recorded in current and non-current income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2018.  we have elected to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years.
also included in long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon.  due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made.  therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits.  see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r&d milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, maintenance of exclusive rights to distribute a product.  since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table.  these payments could range from $0 to $58 million.
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods.  significant accounting policies which require management's judgment are discussed below.
excess inventory and instruments - we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost.  similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply.  accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value.  to determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components.  the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work‐in‐process inventory, which is recorded at cost.  obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off.  management evaluates the need for changes to the net realizable values of inventory and instruments based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis.
income taxes - our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid.  we are subject to income taxes in the
39
u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction.  realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits.  we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is "more likely than not" that the deferred tax benefit will be realized.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations.  we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the fasb's guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.  these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
commitments and contingencies - accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported.  we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims.  historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.
goodwill and intangible assets - we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets and risk-adjusted discount rates.  as such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs.  changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.
prior to our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2018, we had six reporting units with goodwill assigned to them.  our annual impairment test determined our emea and spine reporting units' carrying values were in excess of their estimated fair values.  fair value was determined using income and market approaches.  fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting units.  fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our emea and spine reporting units.  as a result of its carrying value being in excess of its estimated fair value, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the emea reporting unit of $567.0 million.  as of december 31, 2018, $755.2 million of goodwill remains for this reporting unit.  the goodwill impairment charge for the spine reporting unit was $401.2 million in 2018.  no goodwill balance remains for this reporting unit.
see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment.
since the carrying value of the emea reporting unit was written down to its estimated fair value, future impairment could occur if the estimates used in the income and market approaches change.  if our estimates of profitability in the reporting unit decline, the fair value estimate under the income approach will decline.  additionally, changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates used to translate cash flows and comparable company valuation indicators, which may impact our estimated fair values.

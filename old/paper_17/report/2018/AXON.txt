item 1a. risk factors because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate our results or trends in future periods. you should carefully consider the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this form 10-k and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the sec before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. if any of the following trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
we are materially dependent on acceptance of our products by law enforcement markets, both domestic and international. if law enforcement agencies do not continue to purchase and use our products, our revenues will be adversely affected.
at any point, due to external factors and opinions, whether or not related to product performance, law enforcement agencies may elect to no longer purchase our cews or other products.
we substantially depend on sales of our taser 7, taser x26p and x2 cews, and if these products do not continue to be widely accepted, our growth prospects will be diminished.
in the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived a significant portion of our revenues from sales of taser cew brand devices and related cartridges, and expect to depend on sales of these products for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. a decrease in the selling prices of, or demand for these products, or their failure to maintain broad market acceptance, would significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.
the success of our axon evidence software as a service ("saas") delivery model is materially dependent on acceptance of this business model by our law enforcement customers. delayed or lengthy time to adoption by law enforcement agencies will negatively impact our sales and profitability.
a substantial number of law enforcement agencies may be slow to adopt our axon evidence digital data evidence management and storage solution, requiring extended periods of trial and evaluation. the hosted service delivery business model is not presently widely adopted by our law enforcement customer base. as such, the sales cycle has additional complexity with the need to educate our customers and address issues regarding agency bandwidth requirements, data retention policies, data security and chain of evidence custody. delays in successfully securing widespread adoption of axon evidence services could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and financial condition.
if we are unable to design, introduce and sell new products or new product features successfully, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products or new product features that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. these products include, but are not limited to, axon body 3, axon records, axon dispatch, and future generations of the taser cew and axon fleet. the development of new products and new product features is complex, time consuming and expensive, and we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. we cannot provide any assurance that products that we may develop in the future will achieve market acceptance. if we fail to develop new products or new product features on a timely basis that achieve market acceptance, our business, financial results and competitive position could be adversely affected.
delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues and cash flows.
the development of cews, devices, sensors and software is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. our focus on our saas platform also presents new and complex development issues. significant delays in new product or service releases
8
or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.
we face risks associated with rapid technological change and new competing products.
the technology associated with law enforcement devices is receiving significant attention and is rapidly evolving. while we have some patent protection in certain key areas of our cew, axon device and saas technology, it is possible that new technology may result in competing products that operate outside our patents and could present significant competition for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.
defects in our products could reduce demand for our products and result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance and damage to our reputation.
complex components and assemblies used in our products may contain undetected defects that are subsequently discovered at any point in the life of the product. defects in our products could result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation and increased warranty costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.
if our security measures or those of our third-party cloud storage providers are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to customers' data or our data, our network, data centers and service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
our service involves the storage and transmission of customers' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of information or the total deletion of all stored customer data, litigation and possible liability. we devote significant resources to engineer secure products and ensure security vulnerabilities are mitigated, and we require our third-party service providers to do so as well. despite these efforts, security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, and malfeasance or otherwise. breaches could occur during transfer of data to data centers or at any time, and result in unauthorized access to our data or our customers' data. third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers' data. additionally, hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack or gain access to our networks and data centers.
because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, grow more complex over time, and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. moreover, our security measures and those of our third-tparty service providers or customers may not detect such security breaches if they occur. although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure that such measures will provide absolute security, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks.
a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss or inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, or the denial of access to this data. a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, disrupt our business, damage our reputation, lead to legal liability, negatively impact our future sales and significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.
defects or disruptions in our services could impact demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.
we currently serve our axon evidence customers from third-party cloud storage providers based in the u.s. and other countries. interruptions in our service, or loss or corruption of digital evidence, may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.
9
since our customers use our services for important aspects of their operations, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' operations. as a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our warranty expense, an increase in collection cycles for and decline in the collectability of accounts receivable, and an increase in the expense and risk of litigation.
our business is subject to complex and evolving u.s. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters. many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.
we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. the introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. in addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states.
these u.s. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. as a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.
we are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. for example, in 2016, the european union and united states agreed to an alternative transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united states, called the privacy shield, but this new framework is subject to an annual review that could result in changes to our obligations and also may be challenged by national regulators or private parties. if one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from europe to the united states is invalidated, if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.
proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. there currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. in addition, the new european general data protection regulation ("gdpr") took effect in may 2018 and applies to all of our products and services that provide service in europe. the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union ("eu") that are different than those currently in place in the european union. for example, we may be required to obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service. in addition, the gdpr includes significant penalties for non-compliance. similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. in addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
these laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.
10
most of our end-user customers are subject to budgetary and political constraints that may delay or prevent sales.
most of our end-user customers are government agencies. these agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore, have limited control over the amount of money they can spend. in addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. as a result, even if an agency wants to acquire our products, it may be unable to purchase them due to budgetary or political constraints, particularly in challenging economic environments. there can be no assurance that the economic and budgeting issues will not worsen and adversely impact sales of our products. some government agency orders may also be canceled or substantially delayed due to budgetary, political or other scheduling delays, which frequently occur in connection with the acquisition of products by such agencies, and such cancellations may accelerate or be more severe than we have experienced historically.
we expend significant resources in anticipation of a sale due to our lengthy sales cycle and may receive no revenue in return.
generally, law enforcement and corrections agencies consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products, including product benefits, training costs, the cost to use our products in addition to, or in place of, other products, budget constraints and product reliability, safety and efficacy. the length of our sales cycle may range from a few weeks to as long as several years. adverse publicity surrounding our products or the safety of such products has in the past, and could in the future, lengthen our sales cycle with customers. in the past, we believe that our sales were adversely impacted by negative publicity surrounding our products or the use of our products. see, for example, "litigation - product litigation" in note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report. we may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant effort in connection with the evaluation of our products by potential customers before they place an order. if these potential customers do not purchase our products, we will have expended significant resources and received no revenue in return.
due to municipal government funding rules, certain of our contracts are subject to appropriation, termination for convenience, or similar cancellation clauses, which could allow our customers to cancel or not exercise options to renew contracts in the future.
although we have entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipate the contracts will be completed, if agencies do not appropriate money in future year budgets, terminate contracts for convenience or if other cancellation clauses are invoked, revenue and cash associated with these bookings will not ultimately be recognized, and could result in a reduction to bookings and revenue.
an increasing percentage of our revenue is derived from subscription billing arrangements which may result in delayed cash collections and may increase customer credit risk on receivables and contract assets.
a growing portion of our sales are derived from subscription billing arrangements and on an open credit basis. while we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, if we become aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.
changes in civil forfeiture laws may affect our customers' ability to purchase our products some of our customers use funds seized through civil forfeiture proceedings to fund the purchase of our products.  changes in state legislatures could impact our customers' ability to seize funds or use seized funds to fund purchases. changes in civil forfeiture statutes or regulations are outside of our control and could limit the amount of funds available to our customers, which could adversely affect the sale of our products.
11
saas revenue for axon evidence is recognized over the terms of the contracts, which may be several years, and, as such, trends in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
our saas service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts, which generally range from one to five years. as a result, most of the saas revenue we report each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, current positive or negative trends in this portion of our business may not be fully reflected in our revenue results for several periods.
we utilize multiple third-party cloud-based storage providers to host the axon evidence.com platform.
utilizing and administering multiple cloud-based storage providers may result in duplication of efforts and resources, increased cost structure, and organization complexities. these complexities and additional costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.
we may face personal injury, wrongful death and other liability claims that harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales and financial condition.
our cew products are often used in aggressive confrontations that may result in serious, permanent bodily injury or death to those involved. our cew products may be associated with these injuries. a person, or the family members of a person, injured in a confrontation or otherwise in connection with the use of our products, may bring legal action against us to recover damages on the basis of theories including wrongful death, personal injury, negligent design, defective product or inadequate warning. we are currently subject to a number of such lawsuits and we have been subject to significant adverse judgments and settlements. we may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our products. if successful, wrongful death, personal injury, misuse and other claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could result in negative publicity about our products. we incur significant legal expenses in defending these cases, and significant litigation could also result in a diversion of management's attention and resources, negative publicity and a potential award of monetary damages in excess of our insurance coverage. the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that our existing or any future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
other litigation may subject us to significant litigation costs and judgments and divert management attention from our business.
we have been or could in the future be involved in numerous other litigation matters relating to our products, contracts and business relationships, including litigation against persons whom we believe have infringed on our intellectual property, infringement litigation filed against us, litigation against a competitor and litigation filed by a former distributor against us. such matters have resulted, and are expected to continue to result in, substantial costs to us, including in the form of attorney's fees and costs, damages, fines or other penalties, whether pursuant to a judgment or settlement, and diversion of our management's attention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. there is also a risk of adverse judgments, as the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose our competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights. we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which could cause us to incur litigation costs and divert management attention from our business.
our future success depends upon our proprietary technology. our protective measures, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret protection, and internet identity registrations, may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights and market advantage. the right to stop others from misusing our trademarks and service marks in commerce depends, to some extent, on our ability to show evidence of enforcement of our rights against such misuse in commerce. our efforts to stop improper use, if insufficient, may lead to loss of trademark and service mark rights, brand loyalty and notoriety among our customers and prospective customers. the scope of any patent to which we have or may obtain rights may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products. the validity and breadth of claims covered in technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions, and the resolution of such claims
12
may be highly uncertain, lengthy and expensive. in addition, our patents may be held invalid upon challenge, or others may claim rights in or ownership of our patents. moreover, we are subject to litigation with parties that claim, among other matters, that we infringed their patents or other intellectual property rights. the defense and prosecution of patent and other intellectual property claims are both costly and time consuming, divert our management's attention from our business and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, and financial position and operating results.
if our products were found to infringe a third-party's proprietary rights, we could be forced to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements in order to be able to sell our products or discontinue use of the protected technology. such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. we could also be required to pay substantial  damages, fines or other penalties, indemnify customers or distributors, cease the manufacture, use, or sale of infringing  products or processes, and/or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies. there is no guarantee that our use of conventional technology searching and brand clearance searching will identify all potential rights holders. rights holders may demand payment for past infringements and/or force us to accept costly license terms or discontinue use of protected technology and/or works of authorship that may include, for example, photos, videos, and software. our current research and development focus on developing software-based products increases this risk.
we are a defendant in a litigation matter filed by digital ally inc. ("digital") in the district of kansas alleging patent infringement regarding our axon signal technology. for additional discussion of this matter, refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. we believe the patent in question is both invalid and not infringed, and we do not currently believe it is probable that we will incur a material loss. if, contrary to our expectations, the court allows digital's entire market value and treble damage theories to proceed on summary judgment rulings, and if digital ultimately succeeds on such theories at trial, the outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability is recognized and on our cash flows for the period in which any damages are paid.
internationally, we can enforce patent rights only in the jurisdictions in which our patent applications have been granted.
our u.s. patents protect us from imported infringing products coming into the u.s. from abroad. we have made applications for patents in a few foreign countries; however, these may be inadequate to protect markets for our products in other foreign countries. each patent is examined and granted according to the law of the country where it was filed independent of whether a u.s. patent on similar technology was granted. a patent in a foreign country may be subject to cancellation if the claimed invention has not been sold in that country. meeting the requirements of working invention differs by country and ranges from sales in the country to manufacturing in the country. u.s. export law, or the laws of some foreign countries, may prohibit us from satisfying the requirements for working the invention, creating a risk that some of our international patents may become unenforceable.
government regulations applied to our products could materially and adversely affect our business.
we rely on the opinions of the u.s. bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, including the determination that a device that has projectiles propelled by the release of compressed gas in place of the expanding gases from ignited gunpowder, are not classified as firearms. changes in statutes, regulations, and interpretation outside of our control may result in our products being classified or reclassified as firearms. our private citizen market could be substantially reduced if consumers are required to obtain a registration to own a firearm prior to purchasing our products.
federal regulation of sales in the u.s.: our cews are not firearms regulated by the u.s. bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, but our consumer products are regulated by the u.s. consumer product safety commission. although there are currently no federal laws restricting sales of our core cew products in the u.s., future federal regulation could adversely affect sales of our products.
axon body worn cameras and fleet vehicle cameras are subject to regulations including 21-cfr-47 part 15, subpart c for bluetooth and wifi transmission, us-dot/un 38.3 for transportation of lithium batteries, and fcc kdb 447498 + ieee 1528-2013 specific absorption rate ("sar") regulations. these regulations are also beginning to affect cews with signal performance power magazine ("sppm") technology and future cews implementing wireless
13
technology into the feature set. compliance with government regulations could increase our operations and product costs and impact our future financial results.
federal regulation of international sales: our cew devices are considered a "crime control" product by the u.s. department of commerce ("doc") for export directly from the u.s. consequently, we must obtain an export license from the doc for the export of our cew devices from the u.s. other than to canada. in addition, certain of our camera and software products require classifications from the doc before they may be shipped internationally. our inability to obtain doc export licenses or classifications on a timely basis for sales of our products to our international customers could significantly and adversely affect our international sales.
state and local regulation: our cew devices are controlled, restricted or their use prohibited by a number of state and local governments. as of december 31, 2018, the possession of stun guns by the general public, including our cew devices, is prohibited in four states: hawaii, massachusetts, new york, and rhode island, as well as in the district of columbia. some cities and municipalities also prohibit private citizen possession or use of our cew products. other jurisdictions may ban or restrict the sale of our cew products and our product sales may be significantly affected by additional state, county and city governmental regulation.
international regulation: certain jurisdictions prohibit, restrict, or require a permit for the importation, sale, possession or use of cews, including in some countries by law enforcement agencies, limiting our international sales opportunities.
our cew products are also subject to regulation by testing, safety and other standard organizations (e.g. ansi, iec, nist).
our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
our international operations are significant, and we plan to continue to grow internationally by acquiring existing entities or setting up new legal entities in new markets. in certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:
•   restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the u.s.
•   import and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market or obtaining necessary parts and components to manufacture products, which may lead to decreased sales and may increase our operating costs.
•   longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.
•   uncertainty regarding liability for products and services, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.
•   different employee/employer relationships, existence of workers' councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.
additionally, changes in international local political, economic, regulatory, tax, social, and labor conditions may adversely harm our business and compliance with complex foreign and u.s. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, among others, environmental regulations, internal control and disclosure rules, privacy and data protection requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and competition regulations, among others.
our business in the united kingdom may be negatively impacted by uncertainty regarding the exit of the united kingdom from the european union (commonly referred to as "brexit"). the exit itself could negatively impact the
14
united kingdom and other economies, which could adversely affect sales of our products and services. we may also experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling, the euro and other european currencies. in addition, brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and the european union, and we may incur additional costs or need to make operational changes as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks.
violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international growth efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.
environmental laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.
we are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain substances in our products and making producers for those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal. in particular, environmental legislation within the eu may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our revenues from eu countries as we comply with and implement these requirements.
the eu has published directives on the restriction of certain hazardous substances in electronic and electrical equipment (the "rohs directive") and on electronic and electrical waste management (the "weee directive"). the rohs directive restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead. the weee directive directs members of the eu to enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the eu. in addition, similar environmental legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including the u.s. (under federal and state laws) and other countries, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.
we continue to monitor the impact of specific registration and compliance activities required by the rohs and weee directives. we endeavor to comply with applicable environmental laws, yet compliance with such laws could increase our operations and product costs, increase the complexities of product design, procurement, and manufacturing, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, limit our sales activities, and impact our future financial results. any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties, and prohibiting sales of our products into one or more states or countries, and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
regulations related to voice, data and communications services may impact our ability to sell our products.
the radio spectrum is required to provide wireless voice, data and video communications services. the allocation of spectrum is regulated in the u.s. and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users. in the u.s., the federal communications commission ("fcc") regulates spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities. similarly, countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of radio spectrum and electromagnetic interference, pursuant to their respective national laws. we manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies. consequently, our results could be negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the fcc or regulatory agencies in other countries. regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed. if current products do not comply with the regulations set forth by these governing bodies, we may be unable to sell our products or could incur penalties, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
15
our dependence on third-party suppliers for key components of our devices could delay shipment of our products and reduce our sales.
we depend on certain domestic and international suppliers for the delivery of components used in the assembly of our products. our reliance on third-party suppliers creates risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or sub-assemblies and reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components and sub-assemblies. specifically, we depend on suppliers of sub-assemblies, machined parts, injection molded plastic parts, printed circuit boards, custom wire fabrications and other miscellaneous customer parts for our products. we do not have long-term agreements with any of our suppliers and there is no guarantee that supply will not be interrupted. due to changes imposed for imports of foreign products into the u.s., as well as potential port closures and delays created by terrorist attacks or threats, public health issues, national disasters or work stoppages, we are exposed to risk of delays caused by freight carriers or customs clearance issues for our imported parts. any interruption of supply for any material components of our products could significantly delay the shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and financial condition.
component shortages could result in our inability to produce at a volume to adequately meet customer demand, which could result in a loss of sales, delay in deliveries and injury to our reputation.
single or sole-source components used in the manufacture of our products may become unavailable or discontinued. delays caused by industry allocations or obsolescence may take weeks or months to resolve. in some cases, parts obsolescence may require a product re-design to ensure quality replacement components. these delays could cause significant delays in manufacturing and loss of sales, leading to adverse effects significantly impacting our financial condition or results of operations and injure our reputation.
we may experience a decline in gross margins due to rising raw material and transportation costs associated with a future increase in petroleum prices.
a significant number of our raw materials are comprised of petroleum-based products, or incur some form of landed cost associated with transporting the raw materials or components to our facility. a significant rise in oil prices could adversely impact our ability to sustain current gross margins by increasing component pricing and transportation costs.
we may experience a decline in gross margins due to a shift in product sales from cews to axon devices which may continue to carry a lower gross margin.
we continue to invest in the growth of the software and sensors segment, and this expected growth may result in a higher percentage of total revenues being comprised of software and sensors products and services. gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the software and sensors segment is currently lower than that of the taser devices segment, and may continue to be lower in the future.
to the extent demand for our products increases, our future success will be dependent upon our ability to manage our growth and to increase manufacturing production capacity, which may be accomplished by the implementation of customized manufacturing automation equipment.
to the extent demand for our products increases significantly in future periods, one of our key challenges will be to increase our production capacity to meet sales demand while maintaining product quality. our primary strategies to accomplish this include introducing additional shifts, increasing the physical size of our assembly facilities, the hiring of additional production staff, and the implementation of additional customized automation equipment. the investments we make in this equipment may not yield the anticipated labor and material efficiencies. our inability to meet any future increase in sales demand or effectively manage our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial results and financial condition.
16
our future success is dependent on our ability to expand sales through distributors and direct sales and our inability to recruit new distributors or increase direct sales would negatively affect our sales.
our distribution strategy is to pursue sales through multiple channels with an emphasis on independent distributors and direct sales. our inability to establish relationships with and retain law enforcement equipment distributors, who we believe can successfully sell our products, would adversely affect our sales. in addition, our arrangements with our distributors are generally short-term. we are also focusing on direct sales to larger agencies through our regional sales managers and our inability to grow sales to these agencies in this manner could adversely affect our sales. if we do not competitively price our products, meet the requirements of our distributors or end-users, provide adequate marketing support, or comply with the terms of our distribution arrangements, our distributors may fail to aggressively market our products or may terminate their relationships with us. these developments would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales. our reliance on the sales of our products by others also makes it more difficult to predict our revenues, cash flow and operating results.
the increased focus on direct sales compared to sales through distribution is dependent on our ability to sell into the states or foreign jurisdictions that have established distributor relationships.
in certain states and foreign jurisdictions we have decided to pursue sales directly with law enforcement customers, rather than working through established distribution channels. our customers may have strong working relationships with distributors and we may face resistance to this change. if we do not overcome this resistance and effectively build a direct relationship with our customers, sales may be adversely affected.
acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business.
we may consider additional acquisitions or joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, expected synergies are not achieved, we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, we experience difficulty in the integration or coordination of new employees, business systems, and technology, or there is a diversion of management's attention from our other businesses. these events could harm our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.
if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually. if such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. events which might indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, declines in stock price market capitalization or cash flows, adverse cost factors, deteriorating financial performance, strategic decisions made in response to economic, market and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on us and our customer base, and/or relevant events such as changes in management, key personnel, litigation or customers.
we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.
catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, fire, explosion, failure to contain hazardous materials, industrial accident, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology

systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results as well as expose us to claims, litigation and governmental investigations and fines.
our financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies.
for current and potential international customers whose contracts are denominated in u.s. dollars, the relative change in local currency values creates relative fluctuations in our product pricing. these changes in international end-user costs may result in lost orders and reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain foreign markets. additionally, intercompany sales to our non-u.s. dollar functional currency international subsidiaries are transacted in u.s. dollars which could increase our foreign exchange rate risk caused by foreign currency transaction gains and losses.
for non-u.s. dollar denominated sales, weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar generally leads us to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for our products. should we decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar's strengthening, the u.s. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings would be adversely affected. we do not currently engage in hedging activities. fluctuations in foreign currency could result in a change in the u.s. dollar value of our foreign denominated assets and liabilities including accounts receivable. therefore, the u.s. dollar equivalent collected on a given sale could be less than the amount invoiced causing the sale to be less profitable than contemplated.
we also import selected components which are used in the manufacturing of some of our products. although our purchase orders are generally in u.s. dollars, weakness in the u.s. dollar could lead to price increases for the components.
unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our operating results we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states. our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, and changes in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in federal, state or international tax laws including fundamental tax law changes applicable to corporate multinationals.
additionally, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period.
the enactment of tax reform legislation, including legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
legislation or other changes in the tax laws could increase our liability and adversely affect our after-tax profitability. for example, the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act") was enacted in the united states on december 22, 2017. the tax act had a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenses and net deferred tax assets. the tax act, among other things, reduced the u.s. corporate statutory tax rate, eliminated or limited deduction of several expenses which were previously deductible, imposed a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries, required a minimum tax on earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries and permitted a tax-free repatriation of foreign earnings through a dividends received deduction.

we maintain most of our cash balances, some of which are not insured, at four depository institutions.
we maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents accounts at four depository institutions. as of december 31, 2018, the aggregate balances in such accounts were $342.3 million. our balances with these institutions regularly exceed federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") insured limits for domestic deposits and various deposit insurance programs covering our deposits in australia, finland, germany, the netherlands, the united kingdom, and vietnam.
we could suffer losses with respect to the uninsured balances if the depositary institutions failed and the institution's assets were insufficient to cover its deposits and/or the governments did not take actions to support deposits in excess of existing insurance limits. any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
we depend on our ability to attract and retain our key management, sales and technical personnel.
our success depends upon the continued service of our key management personnel. our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified technical personnel. although we have employment agreements with certain of our officers and other members of our execute management team, the employment of such persons is "at-will" and either we or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any time, subject to the applicable terms of the employment agreements. the competition for our key employees is intense. the loss of the service of one or more of our key personnel could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
we are highly dependent on the services of patrick w. smith, our chief executive officer.
we are highly dependent on the services of patrick w. smith, our founder and chief executive officer. our future success depends upon our ability to retain executive officers, specifically mr. smith, and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
risks related to ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10-k, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
•   actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;
•   the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;
•   actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
•   investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;
•   announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;
•   announcements by us or estimates by third-parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, addressable market or the effectiveness of our products;
•   changes in operation performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industries, including our developers and competitors;
•   price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;
•   media coverage of our business and financial performance;
•   lawsuits threatened or filed against us;
19
•   developments in anticipated or new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulator actions, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial or regulatory bodies; and
•   other events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events.
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter-to-quarter, which may cause our stock price to decline.
our revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to various factors, including, but not limited to:
•   budgetary cycles of municipal, state and federal law enforcement and corrections agencies;
•   market acceptance of our products and services;
•   the timing of large domestic and international orders;
•   the outcome of any existing or future litigation;
•   adverse publicity surrounding our products, the safety of our products, or the use of our products;
•   changes in our sales mix;
•   new product introduction costs;
•   increased raw material expenses;
•   changes in our operating expenses;
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
•   regulatory changes that may affect the marketability of our products.
as a result of these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful in the short term, and our performance in a particular period may not be indicative of our performance in any future period.

*not meaningful net sales for the taser segment increased $18.6 million, or 7.9%, primarily as a result of increased sales of taser devices primarily attributable to increased sales under the officer safety plan ("osp") and taser 60 installment payment programs, including sales of taser 7 devices, which commenced during the three months ended december 31, 2018. unit sales for law enforcement taser devices decreased as compared to 2017 primarily as a result of the timing of the taser 7 release and limited production of that device in 2018. we continue to see an increase in extended warranty revenue primarily as a result of the increased number of cew devices in the field. cartridge sales also increased compared to 2017 as an increase in the average sales price more than offset a slight decrease in unit sales. during the first quarter of 2017, the home office of the u.k. government approved our x2 devices for sale which resulted in increased sales within the u.k. of $6.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017.
net sales for the software and sensors segment increased $57.7 million, or 52.8%, primarily due to continued adoption of on-officer cameras and related technologies, including our axon evidence digital evidence management software suite. axon evidence revenues increased $32.5 million, primarily driven by the continued increase in active users on the platform. revenues related to axon fleet, which was introduced in the third quarter of 2017, increased $9.6 million. combined net sales related to our axon body, axon flex, and axon dock products increased approximately $4.1 million as an increase in the average sales price more than offset the decrease in unit sales.
to gain more immediate feedback regarding activity for axon camera products and axon evidence services, we also review bookings for these products. we consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods. due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. although we have entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipate the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate funds in future year budgets, or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings. bookings related to our software and sensors segment, net of cancellations, were $389.1 million during 2018, compared to $291.2 million in 2017, an increase of 33.6%.

the chart below illustrates our quarterly software and sensors bookings for each of the previous six fiscal quarters (in thousands):
backlog - as of december 31, 2018 compared to december 31, 2017
our backlog for products and services includes all orders that have been received and are believed to be firm.
in the taser segment, we define backlog as equal to deferred revenue. deferred revenue represents amounts invoiced to customers for goods and services to be delivered in subsequent periods. we process orders within the taser segment quickly, and our best estimate of firm orders outstanding as of period end represents those that have been paid for but remain undelivered. the taser segment backlog balance was $54.6 million as of december 31, 2018. we expect to realize $22.2 million of this deferred revenue balance as revenue during the next 12 months. this represents cash received and accounts receivable from customers on or prior to december 31, 2018 for products and services expected to be delivered in the next 12 months.
in the software and sensors segment, we define backlog as cumulative bookings, net of cancellations, less product and service revenue recognized to date. bookings are generally realized as revenue over multiple years. the software and sensors backlog balance was $758.1 million as of december 31, 2018. this backlog balance includes $126.8 million of deferred revenue, and $631.3 million that has been recorded as bookings but not yet invoiced, all as of december 31, 2018. we expect to realize approximately $225.0 million of the december 31, 2018 backlog balance as revenue during the next 12 months.

our backlog of $812.7 million as of december 31, 2018 has increased significantly from $582.7 million as of december 31, 2017. the increase in taser segment backlog is not expected to have a material impact on revenue or operating margins. our significant increase in backlog, primarily in the software and sensors segment is indicative of expected revenue growth in this segment. revenue growth in the software and sensors segment is expected to result in improved operating margins over time as additional revenue will cover a larger portion of our selling, general and
29
administrative expenses, and research and development costs, while we do not expect any material changes in gross margins.

within the taser segment, cost of product sales increased $8.3 million, or 11.5%, to $80.4 million in 2018, compared to $72.1 million in 2017, and increased as a percentage of sales to 31.7% from 30.7%. we did not experience significant changes in variable manufacturing costs during the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. the overall increase in cost of product sales was attributable to higher unit sales. the increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to initial production costs for the taser 7 device.
within the software and sensors segment, cost of product and service sales was $81.1 million, an increase of $16.5 million, or 25.5%, from 2017. as a percentage of net sales, cost of product and service sales decreased to 48.6% in 2018 from 59.2% in 2017. the increase in cost of product sales was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes, and the increase in cost of service sales was driven by increased cloud storage costs. the decrease in total cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was primarily due to the reduction of non-recurring expenses related to our data migration to our new cloud-storage provider that was completed in 2018, as well as increased leveraging of fixed costs related to cloud-storage.

gross margin increased $51.5 million to $258.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $207.1 million for 2017. as a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased to 61.6% for 2018 from 60.2% for 2017. as a percentage of net sales, gross margin for the taser segment decreased slightly to 68.3% for the year ended december 31, 2018 from 69.3% for the year ended december 31, 2017. within the software and sensors segment, gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 51.4% and 40.8% for the years ended 2018 and 2017, respectively. within the software and sensors segment, hardware gross margin was 20.8% for the year ended december 31, 2018 and 10.5%
30
for the same period in 2017, while the service margins were 76.0% and 67.7% during those same periods, respectively. the increase in hardware gross margins during 2018 was primarily attributable to accounting changes required under the new revenue accounting standard. previously, the level of discounting in our contracts resulted in a portion of the contractual consideration allocated to the delivered hardware being recognized as revenue ratably over the axon evidence subscription term, while the full cost of the product was recognized when the hardware was delivered to the customer resulting in lower gross margins initially. under the new revenue accounting standard, generally the full amount of revenue related to the delivered hardware is recognized in the period in which it is delivered, resulting in better matching of the revenues and related costs. the increase in service margins during the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to 2017 was attributable to the reduction of non-recurring expenses related to our data migration to our new cloud-storage provider that was completed in 2018, as well as increased leveraging of fixed costs related to cloud-storage.

within the taser segment, r&d expenses increased $8.6 million or 103.1%. salaries, benefits, bonus and stock-based compensation in the taser segment increased $6.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017 as we continue to invest in personnel allocated to the development of new cew related technologies. additionally, test build materials included in the "other" category were higher than the prior year primarily related to the launch of the taser 7 device.
our software and sensors segment was responsible for 59.8% of the overall increase in r&d expense. within this segment, r&d expenses increased $12.8 million or 27.3%, but decreased to 35.8% of sales as compared to 43.0% in the prior year. of the increase, $12.7 million related to salaries, benefits, bonus, and stock-based compensation. partially offsetting the increase was a $1.0 million decrease in impairment expense as compared to 2017; during 2017, we abandoned certain developed technology acquired in a business combination.
we expect r&d expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in the deployment of new cew technologies and focus on growing the software and sensors segment as we add headcount and additional resources to develop new products and services to further advance our scalable cloud-connected device platform. we believe that these investments will result in an increase in our subscription revenue base, which over time will result in revenue increasing faster than the increase in sg&a expenses and r&d costs, as we reach economies of scale.

net sales for the taser segment increased $1.6 million, or 2.6%, on a sequential basis primarily due to an overall increase in taser device handles, including initial sales of taser 7. this increase was partially offset by lower sequential cartridge revenue, which was primarily attributable to timing.
net sales for the software and sensors segment increased $8.3 million, or 20.2%, on a sequential basis. axon fleet contributed $4.1 million of the increase, driven by an increase in both units and average sales price following the release of the fleet 2 device. combined net sales related to our axon body, axon flex, and axon dock products contributed an additional increase of $3.9 million, primarily due to an increase in units. axon evidence revenues increased $1.9 million driven by the continued increase in active users on the platform. the increases were partially offset by a decrease in other revenue.
international sales were $24.3 million in for the three months ended december 31, 2018 compared to $16.7 million for the three months ended september 30, 2018, an increase of $7.6 million, driven by increased sales from australia and canada.

the increase in net sales for 2017 compared to 2016 in the taser segment was primarily attributable to increased sales under the osp and taser 60 installment payment programs. during the first quarter of 2017, the home office of the u.k. government approved our x2 devices for sale which resulted in increased taser x2 sales within the u.k. of $8.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to no sales during 2016. additionally, we increased cartridge sales by $10.9 million to $63.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to $52.3 million during the same period in 2016 which was primarily attributable to an increase in total devices in the field.
net sales for the software and sensors segment were $109.3 million and $65.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $43.7 million, or 66.6%. the overall increase in the software and sensors segment was driven by continued adoption of on-officer cameras and related technologies, including our axon evidence digital evidence management software suite. combined net sales related to our axon body, axon flex, and axon dock products increased approximately $9.3 million. we recorded net sales of $3.0 million related to axon fleet, our then-newly introduced in-car camera system, with no amounts recorded during the same period in 2016. axon evidence revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased $28.6 million to $57.8 million as compared to the same period in 2016. this increase was primarily driven by the continued increase in active users on our axon evidence platform.

we did not experience significant changes in variable manufacturing costs during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. the overall increase in cost of products sold was attributable to higher unit sales.
within the software and sensors segment, cost of product and service sales was $64.7 million, an increase of $28.9 million, or 80.7%, from 2016. as a percentage of net sales, cost of product and service sales increased to 59.2% in 2017 from 54.5% in 2016. the increase in cost of product sales was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes, and the increase in cost of service sales was driven by increased cloud storage costs. the increase in total cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was primarily attributable to non-recurring expenses related to our data migration to a new cloud-storage provider.

within the taser segment, r&d expenses increased $2.5 million, or 42.3%, to $8.4 million in 2017. salaries, benefits, bonus and stock-based compensation in the taser segment increased $1.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by additional headcount as we continued to invest in the development of new cew related technologies.
within the software and sensors segment, r&d expenses increased $22.3 million, or 90.1%, to $47.0 million in 2017 from the prior year. our software and sensors segment was responsible for approximately 85% of the overall expenses in r&d. of the $22.3 million increase in r&d for the software and sensors segment, $17.4 million related to salaries, benefits, bonus, and stock-based compensation. the increase in professional and consulting expense of $1.2 million was primarily attributable to increased technical consulting fees related to the development and release of signal sidearm. included in other r&d expenses for the software and services segment was $1.9 million of amortization of intangible assets related to acquired developed technology that was yet to be put into service. additionally, during 2017, we abandoned certain developed technology acquired in a business combination resulting in an impairment charge of $1.0 million which was included in other r&d expenses.

interest and other income (expense), net interest and other income (expense), net was $2.7 million and $(0.4) million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we earned interest income of $1.6 million and had gains from foreign currency transaction adjustments of $1.4 million which were partially offset by interest expense of $0.2 million. for the year ended december 31, 2016, interest income of $0.7 million was more than offset by losses on foreign currency transaction adjustments of $1.1 million.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was $10.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 66.9%. in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act, we were able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the tax act and recorded a provisional net tax expense of $8.0 million in the period ended december 31, 2017, primarily related to the impact of the tax rate reduction on our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. this was partially offset by a $1.8 million benefit related to excess stock-based compensation deductions, as well as a $2.4 million benefit for research and development credits during the year ended december 31, 2017. in addition, an additional valuation allowance in the amount of $1.9 million was recorded as of december 31, 2017, related to certain research and development credits that may not be utilized prior to expiration and losses in certain foreign jurisdictions in which there was a cumulative loss.
the provision for income taxes was $14.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the effective income tax rate for 2016 was 45.1%. the effect of state income taxes of $0.9 million and the tax effects of intercompany transactions of $0.6 million were offset by a benefit of $1.9 million for research and development credits in the current year. the difference between statutory and foreign tax rates of $1.5 million was largely driven by losses incurred in a foreign entity for which no tax benefit will be realized. in addition, a valuation allowance in the amount of $1.8 million was recorded as of december 31, 2016 related to certain research and development tax credits that may not be utilized prior to expiration and losses in certain foreign jurisdictions in which there was a cumulative loss.
net income our net income decreased by $12.1 million to $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $17.3 million in 2016. net income per basic and diluted share was $0.10 for 2017 compared to $0.33 and $0.32 per basic and diluted share, respectively, for 2016.
non-gaap financial measures to supplement our financial results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("gaap"), we present the non-gaap financial measures of ebitda and adjusted ebitda (ceo performance award). our management uses these non-gaap financial measures in evaluating our performance in comparison to prior periods. we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-gaap financial measures in assessing our performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. a reconciliation of gaap to the non-gaap financial measures is presented below.
•   ebitda (most comparable gaap measure: net income) - earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
•   adjusted ebitda (ceo performance award) (most comparable gaap measure: net income) - earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
although these non-gaap financial measures are not consistent with gaap, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-gaap financial measures when assessing our operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. however, management recognizes that:

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 of $63.9 million consisted of $29.2 million in net income, the net add-back of non-cash income statement items totaling $32.5 million and a positive $2.2 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. included in the non-cash items were $10.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense, $2.1 million related to the disposal and abandonment of intangible assets, $21.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, and $3.6 million related to deferred income taxes. the most significant increase to the portion of cash provided by operating activities related to the changes in operating assets and liabilities was a $54.2 million increase in deferred revenue. of the increase, $2.8 million resulted from additional extended warranty sales, $23.2 million resulted from increased hardware deferred revenue from taser assurance program ("tap"), osp and taser 7 sales, and $30.1 million related to prepayments for software and sensors services. operating cash flows were also impacted by decreased inventory of $14.8 million resulting from continued inventory optimization efforts. these increases were offset by increased accounts and notes receivable of $67.6 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of $12.7 million during 2018. the increases in accounts and notes receivable were due to increased sales during 2018, primarily sales made under the osp and taser 60 installment plans. the increase in prepaid expenses and other asset accounts of $12.7 million during 2018 was driven primarily by an increase in deferred commissions of $13.0 million representing amounts earned when a contract is booked which is then subsequently amortized.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 of $18.5 million consisted of $5.2 million in net income, the net add-back of non-cash income statement items totaling $28.0 million and a negative $14.8 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. included in the non-cash items are $8.0 million in depreciation and amortization expense, $1.1 million related to the disposal and abandonment of intangible assets, $15.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, $0.7 million of bond premium amortization and $2.8 million related to deferred income taxes. the most significant increase to the portion of cash provided by operating activities related to the changes in operating assets and liabilities was a $39.7 million increase in deferred revenue. of the increase, $7.4 million resulted from additional extended warranty sales, $20.2 million resulted from increased hardware deferred revenue from tap and osp sales, and $12.5 million related to prepayments for software and sensors services. these increases were offset by increased accounts and notes receivable of $35.3 million, inventory of $11.7 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of $9.0 million during 2017. the increases in accounts and notes receivable were due to increased sales during 2017, specifically sales made under the osp and taser 60 installment plans. operating cash flows were also impacted by increased inventory of $11.7 million in anticipation of higher sales in 2018 and for our national field trial offer for body cameras. the increase in prepaid expenses and other asset accounts of $9.0 million during 2017 was driven primarily by increased deferred cost of product sales of $5.0 million related to contracts where the product had shipped but revenue was deferred due to contractual provisions resulting in the cost of product sales being deferred as an asset to be recognized in subsequent periods when revenue recognition criteria have been met, an increase in deferred commissions of $2.1 million representing amounts earned when a contract is booked, which is then subsequently amortized over the contractual period as products and services are delivered, and increased prepaid income taxes of $3.4 million.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 of $21.1 million consisted of $17.3 million in net income, the net add-back of non-cash income statement items totaling approximately $8.8 million and a negative $4.9 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. included in the non-cash items are $3.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense, $9.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, and $1.3 million of bond premium amortization. these additions were partially offset by an $1.4 million reduction related to excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation and $5.2 million related to deferred income taxes. the most significant increase to the portion of cash provided by operating activities related to the changes in operating assets and liabilities was a $34.3 million increase in deferred revenue. of the increase, $8.1 million resulted from additional extended warranty sales, $15.6 million resulted from increased hardware deferred revenue from tap and osp sales, and $10.5 million related to prepayments for software and sensors services. we also had increases in cash provided from operating activities of $17.6 million for increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related primarily to increased inventory purchases. these increases were offset by increased prepaid expenses and other current assets of $10.6 million, inventory of $18.7 million and accounts and notes receivable of $28.4 million during 2016. the increases in accounts and notes receivable were due to increased sales during 2016, and increases in inventory resulted from higher anticipated sales for 2017. the increase in prepaid expenses and other asset accounts during 2016 was driven primarily increased deferred commissions of $1.8 million
43
attributable to higher sales, increased balances under corporate-owed life insurance policies of $1.1 million, $3.3 million of restricted cash related primarily to a customer contract requiring certain contractual payments to be deposited in escrow until approved for release, and $1.7 million of long-term contingent consideration deposited in escrow in connection with a business combination that was completed in december 2016.
investing activities primarily as the result of equipment purchases and business acquisitions during the year, we used $9.9 million for investing activities in 2018. calls and maturities on our investments, net of purchases, were $6.8 million. during 2018, we invested $5.0 million in cash for the acquisition of vievu, llc, a public safety camera and cloud-based evidence management system provider for law enforcement agencies. we also invested $11.7 million in the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles, net of proceeds related to disposals.
primarily as the result of investments that matured during the year, we generated $19.1 million from investing activities in 2017. calls and maturities on our investments, net of purchases, were $41.1 million. during 2017, we invested $10.6 million in cash for the acquisition of dextro, inc., to continue building upon our axon artificial intelligence group, and for the acquisition of breon, our former distributor in australia. we also invested $11.4 million in the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles, net of proceeds related to disposals.
primarily as a result of investing cash generated from operating activities, we used $3.0 million in investing activities in 2016. calls and maturities on our investments, net of purchases, were $8.9 million. during 2016, we invested $3.5 million in cash for the acquisition of developed technology and hiring of personnel to form the axon artificial intelligence group. we also invested $8.4 million in the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles, net of proceeds related to disposals.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $219.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. in may 2018, we completed a public follow-on equity offering that generated net proceeds of $234.0 million. during 2018, we paid income and payroll taxes of $14.1 million on behalf of employees who net-settled stock awards during the period. additionally, we paid $2.3 million for contingent consideration amounts earned during 2018 related to the acquisition of certain assets from fossil group, inc. and fossil vietnam, limited liability company in 2016 and to the acquisition of dextro in 2017. these cash outflows were partially offset by $1.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
net cash used by financing activities was $3.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 . during 2017, we paid income and payroll taxes of $3.5 million on behalf of employees who net-settled stock awards during the period. additionally, we paid $1.8 million for contingent consideration amounts earned during 2017 related to the acquisition of certain assets from fossil group, inc. and fossil vietnam, limited liability company in 2016. these cash outflows were partially offset by $1.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
net cash used by financing activities was $34.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. during 2016, we repurchased $33.7 million of our common stock, which was purchased for a weighted average cost of $18.90 per share, inclusive of applicable administrative costs. additionally, we paid income and payroll taxes of $1.8 million on behalf of employees who net-settled stock awards during the period. these cash outflows were partially offset by $0.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and $1.4 million of excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. the purchase of common stock was made under a stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors.
liquidity and capital resources our most significant source of liquidity continues to be funds generated by operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents. in addition, our $100.0 million revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. under the terms of the line of credit, available borrowings are reduced by outstanding letters of credit. advances under the line of credit bear interest at libor plus 1.0 to 1.5% per year determined in
44
accordance with a pricing grid based on our funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") ratio.
as of december 31, 2018, we had letters of credit outstanding of $3.1 million, leaving the net amount available for borrowing of $96.9 million. the facility matures on december 31, 2021 and has an accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total line of credit up to $100.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including the availability of additional bank commitments. there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no borrowings under the line.
our agreement with the bank requires us to comply with a maximum funded debt to ebitda ratio, as defined, of no greater than 2.50 to 1.00 based upon a trailing four fiscal quarter period. at december 31, 2018, the company's funded debt to ebitda ratio was 0.001 to 1.00.
taser 60 installment purchase arrangements typically involve amounts invoiced in five equal installments at the beginning of each year of the five-year term. this is in contrast to a traditional cew sale in which the entire amount being charged for the hardware is invoiced upon shipment. this impacts liquidity in a commensurate fashion, with the cash for the taser 60 arrangement received in five annual installments rather than up front. it is our strategic intent to shift an increasing amount of our business to a subscription model, to better match the municipal budgeting process of our customers as well as to allow for multiple product offerings to be bundled into existing subscriptions. we carefully considered the cash flow impacts of this strategic shift and regularly revisit our cash flow forecast with the goal of maintaining a comfortable level of liquidity as we introduce commercial offerings in which we incur upfront cash costs to produce and fulfill hardware sales ahead of the cash inflows from our customers. we anticipate, and have prepared for, the majority of our arrangements in both reportable segments to be offered in similar subscription-type offerings over the coming years. with the launch of the taser 7, which is primarily being sold in subscription offerings, we expect this strategic shift to accelerate.
based on our strong balance sheet and the fact that we had just $0.1 million in total long-term debt and capital lease obligations at december 31, 2018, we believe financing will be available, both through our existing credit line and possible additional financing. however, there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. we and our board of directors may consider repurchases of our common stock. further repurchases of our common stock would take place on the open market, would be financed with available cash and are subject to authorization as well as market and business conditions.
contractual obligations the following table outlines our future contractual financial obligations by period in which payment is expected, as of december 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

we are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income taxes imposed by several states and foreign jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2018, we had $6.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. the settlement period for our long-term income tax liabilities cannot be determined; however, the liabilities are expected to increase by approximately $1.4 million within the next 12 months.
off-balance sheet arrangements the discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k is incorporated by reference herein.
critical accounting estimates we have identified the following accounting estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the preparation of this annual report on form 10-k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. while we do not believe that a change in these estimates is reasonably likely, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates. the effect of these estimates on our business operations is discussed below.
product warranties we warranty our cews, axon cameras and certain related accessories from manufacturing defects on a limited basis for a period of one year after purchase and, thereafter, will replace any defective unit for a fee. estimated costs for the standard warranty are charged to cost of products sold when revenue is recorded for the related product. future warranty costs are estimated based on historical data related to warranty claims on a quarterly basis and this rate is applied to current product sales. historically, reserve amounts have been increased if management becomes aware of a component failure or other issue that could result in larger than anticipated warranty claims from customers. the warranty reserve is reviewed quarterly to verify that it sufficiently reflects the remaining warranty obligations based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the warranty obligation period, and adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, our warranty reserve was approximately $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively. warranty expense for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $0.7 million, $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. the increase in warranty expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily driven by higher than initially expected warranty claims for the axon flex 2 on-officer body camera. warranty expense for the year ended december 31, 2017, was impacted by lower than initially expected warranty claims for the axon body 2 on-officer body camera. as of december 31, 2018, our reserve also included initial reserves related to taser 7, signal sidearm, and axon fleet 2.
revenue related to separately-priced extended warranties is initially recorded as deferred revenue at its contractual amount and subsequently recognized as net sales on a straight-line basis over the warranty service period. costs related to extended warranties are charged to cost of product and service sales when incurred.
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. cost is determined using the weighted average cost of raw materials, which approximates the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method and includes allocations of manufacturing labor and overhead. provisions are made to reduce potentially excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventories, as well as trial and evaluation inventories to their net realizable value. these provisions are based on management's best estimate after considering historical demand, projected future demand, inventory purchase commitments, industry and market trends and conditions among other factors. we evaluate inventory costs for abnormal costs due to excess production capacity and treats such costs as period costs.
46
during the year ended december 31, 2018, we recorded provisions to reduce inventories to their lower of cost and net realizable value of approximately $3.8 million compared to $2.0 million during 2017. the increase in provisions made during 2018 was primarily attributable to the impact of phasing out previous generations of vievu cameras in an effort to convert existing customers to axon body camera deployments. the remaining change in the provision for 2018 was driven by analyses looking at projected sales data for existing products and making corresponding adjustments to state inventories at their lower of cost and net realizable value.
revenue recognition, deferred revenue and accounts and notes receivable we derive revenue from two primary sources: (1) the sale of physical products, including cews, axon cameras, axon signal enabled devices, corresponding hardware extended warranties, and related accessories such as axon docks, cartridges and batteries, among others, and (2) subscriptions to our axon evidence digital evidence management software as a service ("saas") (including data storage fees and other ancillary services), which includes varying levels of support. to a lesser extent, we also recognize training, professional services and revenue related to other software and saas services. we apply the five-step model outlined in topic 606.
many of our products and services are sold on a standalone basis.we also bundle our hardware products and services together and sell them to our customers in single transactions, where the customer can make payments over a multi-year period. for the the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the composition of revenue recognized from contracts containing multiple performance obligations and those not containing multiple performance obligations was as follows (dollars in thousands):

(1) amounts for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method of adoption of topic 606, and are presented consistent with the prior period amounts reported under asc 605.
additionally, we offer customers the ability to purchase cew cartridges and certain services on an unlimited basis over the contractual term. due to the unlimited nature of these arrangements whereby we are obligated to deliver
47
unlimited products at the customer's request, we account for these arrangements as stand-ready obligations, and recognize revenue ratably over the contract period. cost of product sales is recognized as the products are shipped to the customer.
revenues are recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which is generally distinct and accounted for as a separate performance obligation. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental taxing authorities.
a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in topic 606. for contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our estimate of the standalone selling price ("ssp") of each distinct good or service in the contract.
performance obligations to deliver products, including cews, cameras and related accessories such as cartridges, batteries and docks, are generally satisfied at the point in time we ship the product, as this is when the customer obtains control of the asset under our standard terms and conditions. in certain contracts with non-standard terms and conditions, these performance obligations may not be satisfied until formal customer acceptance occurs. performance obligations to fulfill service-type extended warranties and provide our saas offerings, including axon evidence and other cloud services, are generally satisfied over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of these services over the stated service period.
we have elected to recognize shipping costs as an expense in cost of product sales when the control of hardware products or accessories have transferred to the customer.
sales tax collected on sales is netted against government remittances and thus, recorded on a net basis.
deferred revenue consists of payments received in advance related to products and services for which the criteria for revenue recognition have not yet been met. deferred revenue that will be recognized during the subsequent twelve month period from the balance sheet date is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term. generally, customers are billed in annual installments.
sales are typically made on credit, and we generally do not require collateral. management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition, and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. uncollectible accounts are charged to expense when deemed uncollectible, and accounts and notes receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. this allowance represents management's best estimate and application of judgment considering a number of factors, including third-party credit reports, actual payment history, cash discounts, customer-specific financial information and broader market and economic trends and conditions.
valuation of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. we perform our annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year. finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. management evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of these assets, including intangible assets with indefinite lives, may not be recoverable.
circumstances that might indicate long-lived assets might not be recoverable could include, but are not limited to, a change in the product mix, a change in the way products and services are created, produced or delivered, or a significant change in the way our products are branded and marketed. when performing a review for recoverability, management estimates the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual

disposition. the amount of the impairment loss, if impairment exists, is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair value computed using discounted cash flows. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we abandoned certain developed technology acquired in a business combination resulting in an impairment charge of $2.0 million. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we abandoned certain developed technology acquired in a business combination resulting in an impairment charge of $1.0 million. the impairment charges were recorded within the software and sensors segment. no impairment losses were recorded during the year ended december 31, 2016.
income taxes we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. we also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. we must also assess whether uncertain tax positions as filed could result in the recognition of a liability for possible interest and penalties if any. we have completed research and development tax credit studies for each year a tax credit was claimed for federal, arizona, and california income tax purposes. we determined that it was more likely than not that the full benefit of the research and development tax credit would not be sustained on examination and accordingly, have established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $5.2 million as of december 31, 2018. in addition, we established a $0.1 million liability related to uncertain tax positions for certain federal income tax liabilities, for a total unrecognized tax benefit of $5.3 million. we expect the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit to increase by approximately $1.4 million within the next 12 months. should the unrecognized tax benefit of $5.3 million be recognized, our effective tax rate would be favorably impacted. our estimates are based on information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision. our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state, and local governments, generally years after the returns are filed. these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws.
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the u.s. and internationally, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, or if the recorded tax liability is greater than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit, or additional income tax expense, respectively, in our consolidated financial statements.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. a valuation allowance is established if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business. as of december 31, 2018, we would need to generate approximately $55.1 million of pre-tax income in the u.s. in order to realize the net deferred tax assets for which a benefit has been recorded. this estimate considers the reversal of approximately $14.1 million in gross deferred tax liabilities, $3.5 million tax-effected. we have state net operating losses ("nols") of $2.5 million, which produce deferred tax assets of $0.2 million, which expire at various dates between 2029 and 2036. we anticipate our future income to continue to trend upward from our 2018 results, with sufficient pre-tax book income to realize a large portion of our deferred tax assets. however, based on specific income projections for years in which

arizona r&d tax credits are set to expire, and cumulative losses in certain foreign jurisdictions, a reserve of $7.4 million has been recorded as a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2018.
stock-based compensation we have historically granted stock-based compensation to key employees and non-employee directors as a means of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. stock-based compensation awards primarily consist of service-based rsus. rsus are classified as equity and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. we recognize rsu expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. we also issue performance-based rsus, the vesting of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria related to our operating performance, as well as successful and timely development and market acceptance of future product introductions. for performance-based rsus containing only performance conditions, compensation cost is recognized using the graded attribution model over the explicit or implicit service period. for awards containing multiple service, performance or market conditions, and all conditions must be satisfied prior to vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period, based on management's estimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date. for both service-based and performance-based rsus,we account for forfeitures as they occur as a reduction to stock-based compensation expense and additional paid-in-capital.
for performance-based options, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance goals when the achievement of each individual performance goal becomes probable. for performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement. the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations. refer to note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form 10-k.
we have granted a total of approximately 8.5 million performance-based awards (options and restricted stock units) of which approximately 6.8 million are outstanding as of december 31, 2018, the vesting of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria including the successful development and market acceptance of future product introductions as well as our future sales targets and operating performance. these awards will vest and compensation expense will be recognized based on management's best estimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied using the most currently available projections of future product adoption and operating performance, adjusted at each balance sheet date. changes in the subjective and probability-based assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive income.
contingencies and accrued litigation expense we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including product-related litigation. we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form 10-k.

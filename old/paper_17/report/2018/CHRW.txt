item 1a.   risk factors the following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this 10-k. we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forward-looking statements, including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public.
economic recessions could have a significant, adverse impact on our business. the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in business cycles of our customers, interest rate fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and other economic factors beyond our control. deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks, which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our long-term growth goals:
•   decrease in volumes: a reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth. a significant portion of our freight are transactional or "spot" market opportunities. the transactional market may be more impacted than the freight market by overall economic conditions. in addition, if a downturn in our customers' business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, particularly among certain national retailers or in the food, beverage, retail, manufacturing, paper, ecommerce, or printing industries, our operating results could be adversely affected.
•   credit risk and working capital: some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us, and some may go out of business. in addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase.
•   transportation provider failures: a significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers.
•   expense management: we may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands. in order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. in periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs. in addition, we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time, and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand.
higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin. carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant, or to cover higher operating expenses. our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers. increased demand for truckload services and changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing. in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers, in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates, we may be required to provide transportation services at a net revenue loss.
changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins. in our truckload transportation business, which is the largest source of our net revenues, fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin. while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact, we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a pass-through cost to our truckload business. in times of fluctuating fuel prices, our net revenue margin may also fluctuate.
14
our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services. we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers' freight. we depend on independent third parties to provide truck, rail, ocean, and air services and to report certain events to us, including delivery information and freight claims. these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us, preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers. this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events, including recognizing revenue and claims. in addition, if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. many of these risks are beyond our control, including:
•   equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers;
•   changes in regulations impacting transportation;
•   disruption in the supply or cost of fuel;
•   reduction or deterioration in rail service; and
•   unanticipated changes in transportation rates.
we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions. our operations are subject to the influences of significant political, governmental, and similar changes and our ability to respond to them, including:
•   changes in political conditions and in governmental policies;
•   changes in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations; and
•   wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts.
we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events. a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, heightened security measures, actual or threatened, terrorist attack, strike, civil unrest, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results.
our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks. we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis. our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks, including:
•   changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, and taxations;
•   difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents;
•   limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls;
•   different liability standards; and
•   intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property, including, but not limited to, our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as the laws of the united states.
the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region.
as we continue to expand our business internationally, we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls, as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities. furthermore, we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation. we have limited control over these risks, and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions, we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects.
15
our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model. our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals. in order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. in periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. because of our comprehensive employee training program, our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors. continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers.
we face substantial industry competition. competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broad-based. we compete against traditional and non-traditional logistics companies, including transportation providers that own equipment, third party freight brokers, technology matching services, internet freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services, and on-demand transportation service providers. we also compete against carriers' internal sales forces. in addition, customers can bring in-house some of the services we provide to them. we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors. increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates, and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations. in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers, in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates, we may be required to provide transportation services at a net revenue loss.
we rely on technology to operate our business. we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems. our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users. we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner. if we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems, we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers.
as demonstrated by recent material and high-profile data security breaches, computer malware, viruses, and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations, but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business. furthermore, given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry, we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks.
though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, a significant impact on the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation, impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, and expose us to legal claims and government action, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.
because we manage our business on a decentralized basis, our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices. we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices throughout north america, europe, asia, oceania, and south america, supported by executives and shared and centralized services, with local management responsible for day-to-day operations, profitability, personnel decisions, the growth of the business, and adherence to applicable local laws. our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations. in addition, some of our offices operate with management, sales, and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location without significant central oversight and coordination. our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation.
our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry. results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season. historically, income from operations and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters. we believe this historical pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors, including national holidays, weather patterns, consumer demand, economic conditions, and other similar and subtle forces. although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations, we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future.
16
we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations. we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations. from time to time, the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents, which may result in serious personal injuries. the resulting types and/or amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier. although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees, owner-operators, or independent contractors working for carriers, from time to time, claims may be asserted against us for their actions, or for our actions in retaining them. claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all. in addition, our automobile liability policy has a retention of $5 million per incident. a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, liability claims or workers' compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability. our involvement in the transportation of certain goods, including but not limited to hazardous materials, could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination.
our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce. the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions (such as drought, freeze, insects, and disease) and other conditions over which we have no control. commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile. if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. to assure access to certain commodities, we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations. repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers' ability to grow and harvest marketable crops.
buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability. agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals, and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination. product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination, often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce. we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce, which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages. while we are insured for up to $200 million for product liability claims subject to a $500,000 per incident deductible, settlement of class action claims is often costly, and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available. if we have to recall produce, we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing, transporting, and destroying any allegedly contaminated product, as well as consequential damages. we carry product recall insurance coverage of $50 million. this policy has a retention of $5 million per incident. any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation, particularly of our proprietary and/or licensed branded produce programs. loss due to spoilage (including the need for disposal) is also a routine part of the sourcing business.
our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations. our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate.
we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the dot to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle. the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including certain surety bonding requirements. we are also subject to regulation by the fmc as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc, and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each. we operate as a department of homeland security certified iac, providing air freight services, subject to commercial standards set forth by the iata and federal regulations issued by the tsa. we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of u.s. customs and border protection and other authoritative governmental agencies. we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law.
we source fresh produce under a license issued by the usda as required by paca. we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international, domestic, state, and local agencies and port authorities. our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
17
legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing, transportation services. as part of our logistics services, we operate leased warehouse facilities. our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services, and we are subject to various federal, state, and international environmental, work safety, and hazardous materials regulations. we may experience an increase in operating costs, such as security costs, as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities. no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges, and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result.
department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide and/or receive services with and from these parties. enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and/or prevent the delivery of shipments, which may negatively impact our operations.
we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business. our failure to maintain required permits or licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses.
our contract carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment, including those relating to climate change, which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business. future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the u.s. and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses, which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs. if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. even without any new legislation or regulation, increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services.
we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers. our top 100 customers comprise approximately 33 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 23 percent of consolidated net revenues. our largest customer comprises approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenues. the sudden loss of many of our major customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments. we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates. even if we identify suitable candidates, we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results. in addition, we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments. the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders.
we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies. for acquisitions, success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations. these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment, which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage. if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
our growth and profitability may not continue, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. our long-term growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent. long-term growth targets represent an over time perspective and do not necessarily represent an expected annual growth rate. there can be no assurance that our long-term growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management, administrative, and operational systems to respond to any future growth. future changes in and expansion of our business, or changes in economic or political conditions, could adversely affect our operating margins. slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price.
18
changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate could increase our borrowing costs. a substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on libor. in july 2017, the united kingdom's financial conduct authority ("fca"), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the united kingdom, stated that they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor interest rates indices. the fca has indicated they will support the libor indices through 2021, to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") as its recommended alternative to libor, and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018. sofr is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by u.s. treasury securities.
we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of sofr as the dominant replacement. the market transition away from libor and towards sofr is expected to be gradual and complicated, including the development of term and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between libor and sofr. introduction of an alternative rate also may introduce additional basis risk for market participants as an alternative index is utilized along with libor. there can be no guarantee that sofr will become widely used and that alternatives may or may not be developed with additional complications. we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021, whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor, or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our consolidated total revenues increased 11.8 percent to $16.6 billion in 2018 from $14.9 billion in 2017 due to an increase in transportation revenues driven by increased pricing in most of our transportation services, most notably truckload and ltl. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sourcing total revenues of $120.5 million as a result of our adoption of asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. we achieved record levels of net revenues and income from operations driven by the strong performance of our nast reportable segment. net revenues is a non-gaap financial measure defined below. net revenues increased 14.2 percent to $2.7 billion in 2018 from $2.4 billion in 2017. income from operations increased 17.7 percent to $912.1 million in 2018 from $775.1 million in 2017. our cash flow from operations increased 106.5 percent to $792.9 million in 2018 from $384.0 million in 2017 driven by the growth in income from operations and improved working capital performance. the effective tax rate for 2018 was 24.5 percent compared to 30.7 percent in 2017 driven primarily by an $83.1 million benefit from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tax act"). diluted net income per share increased 32.5 percent to $4.73 in 2018 from $3.57 in 2017.
consolidated results of operations our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers. the following table summarizes our total revenues (dollars in thousands):

net revenues are a non-gaap financial measure calculated as total revenues less the total of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale. we believe net revenues are a useful measure of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider net revenues to be our primary performance measurement. accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations often focuses on the change in our net revenues. the reconciliation of total revenues to net revenues is presented below (in thousands):

consolidated results of operations - 2018 compared to 2017
total revenues and direct costs. our consolidated total revenues increased 11.8 percent to $16.6 billion in 2018 from $14.9 billion in 2017. total transportation revenues increased 14.9 percent to $15.5 billion in 2018 from $13.5 billion in 2017. this increase in transportation revenues was driven by increased pricing in most of our transportation services, most notably truckload and ltl. total purchased transportation and related services increased 14.8 percent in 2018 to $12.9 billion from $11.3 billion in 2017. this increase was due to increased truckload and ltl purchased transportation costs and higher ocean volumes, which were partially offset by the impact of decreased truckload volumes. total sourcing revenues decreased 18.4 percent to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.4 billion in 2017. purchased products sourced for resale decreased 19.3 percent in 2018 to $1.0 billion from $1.2 billion in 2017. sourcing total revenues and purchased products for resale decreased $120.5 million as a result of our adoption of asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. our consolidated total revenues earned from customers within the united states increased 11.7 percent to $14.4 billion in 2018 from $12.9 billion in 2017.
net revenues. total transportation net revenues increased 15.5 percent in 2018 to $2.6 billion from $2.2 billion in 2017. our transportation net revenue margin increased slightly to 16.7 percent in 2018 from 16.6 percent in 2017. this slight increase was driven by increases in customer pricing, including fuel. total sourcing net revenues decreased 8.9 percent to $111.5 million in 2018 from $122.4 million in 2017. this decrease was primarily due to decreases in net revenue per case and a case volume decrease across a variety of commodities and services, most notably in our restaurant and foodservice customers. sourcing net revenue margin increased to 10.0 percent in 2018 from 9.0 percent in 2017, driven by the impact of our adoption of asu 2014-09.
operating expenses. operating expenses consist of personnel and selling, general, and administrative expenses. operating expenses increased 12.6 percent to $1.8 billion in 2018 from $1.6 billion in 2017. this was due to an increase of 13.9 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 8.8 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. as a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses decreased to 66.3 percent in 2018 from 67.3 percent in 2017.
our personnel expenses are driven primarily by earnings growth and headcount. in 2018, personnel expenses increased 13.9 percent to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion in 2017. personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased in 2018 to 49.7 percent from 49.8 percent in 2017. the increase in personnel expense was due primarily to an increase in variable compensation due to our strong earnings growth and growth in our average headcount of 3.5 percent in 2018 compared to 2017.
other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 8.8 percent to $449.6 million in 2018 from $413.4 million in 2017. this increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in occupancy and other professional services expenses, claims, and the provision for bad debt.
27
income from operations. income from operations increased 17.7 percent to $912.1 million in 2018 from $775.1 million in 2017. income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 33.7 percent in 2018 from 32.7 percent in 2017. this increase was due to net revenues growing faster than our operating expenses.
interest and other expenses. interest and other expenses were $31.8 million in 2018 compared to $46.7 million in 2017. the decrease was primarily due to a $16.9 million favorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains in 2018 compared to a $9.4 million unfavorable impact in 2017. the impact of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains was partially offset by increased interest expense due to a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates in 2018 compared to 2017.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 24.5 percent for 2018 and 30.7 percent for 2017, driven primarily by an $83.1 million benefit from the tax act.
net income. net income increased 31.6 percent to $664.5 million in 2018 from $504.9 million in 2017. basic net income per share increased 33.1 percent to $4.78 in 2018 from $3.59 in 2017. diluted net income per share increased 32.5 percent to $4.73 in 2018 from $3.57 in 2017.
segment results of operations - 2018 compared to 2017
north american surface transportation. nast total revenues increased 15.6 percent to $11.2 billion in 2018 compared to $9.7 billion in 2017, primarily due to increased pricing to our customers, including fuel, most notably in truckload and ltl services. this increase was partially offset by the impact of decreased truckload volumes. nast cost of purchased transportation and related services increased 15.3 percent to $9.5 billion in 2018 from $8.2 billion in 2017 following the increase in total revenues. total nast net revenues increased 17.3 percent to $1.8 billion in 2018 compared to $1.5 billion in 2017 driven by double digit net revenue percentage increases from all services. nast net revenue margin increased primarily due to transportation customer pricing growing faster than transportation costs in 2018 compared to 2017.
nast truckload net revenues increased 17.6 percent in 2018 to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion in 2017. nast truckload volumes decreased approximately three percent in 2018 compared to 2017. nast truckload net revenue margin increased modestly in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by higher customer pricing and the impact of moderating freight costs.
nast truckload net revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total north america truckload net revenues in 2018 and 2017. the majority of the remaining north american truckload net revenues is included in robinson fresh. excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel prices, our average north america truckload rate per mile charged to our customers increased approximately 21.5 percent in 2018 compared to 2017. excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel prices, our average north america truckload transportation cost per mile increased approximately 21.0 percent in 2018 compared to 2017.

nast intermodal net revenues increased 17.6 percent in 2018 to $31.4 million from $26.7 million in 2017, driven by elevated repositioning costs included in the 2017 period.
nast operating expenses increased 13.1 percent in 2018 to $1.0 billion from $897.0 million in 2017. this was due to an increase in personnel expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability, and to a lesser extent an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. the operating expenses of nast and all other segments include allocated corporate expenses.
nast income from operations increased 23.2 percent to $773.8 million in 2018 from $628.1 million in 2017. this was primarily due to net revenues growing at a faster rate than operating expenses.
global forwarding. global forwarding total revenues increased 16.2 percent to $2.5 billion in 2018 from $2.1 billion in 2017. this increase was driven by increased volumes in all services and increased customer pricing in ocean and air. global forwarding costs of transportation and related services increased 17.4 percent to $1.9 billion in 2018 from $1.7 billion in 2017. global forwarding net revenues increased 12.1 percent to $543.9 million in 2018 from $485.3 million in 2017. global forwarding net revenue margin decreased primarily due to ocean transportation costs increasing at a faster rate than customer pricing. the acquisition of milgram accounted for approximately three percentage points of the net revenue growth in global forwarding.
28
ocean transportation net revenues increased 7.4 percent to $312.3 million in 2018 from $290.8 million in 2017. this was primarily due to increases in volumes, including those from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in net revenue margin. air net revenues increased 17.5 percent to $111.0 million in 2018 from $94.5 million in 2017. this was primarily due to increases in volumes and an increase in net revenue margin. customs net revenues increased 24.8 percent to $88.5 million in 2018 from $70.9 million in 2017. the increase was primarily due to increased transaction volumes, including those from acquisitions. the acquisition of milgram accounted for approximately 15 percentage points of the customs net revenue growth.
global forwarding operating expenses increased 15.0 percent in 2018 to $452.3 million from $393.4 million in 2017. this increase was due to increases in both personnel and selling, general, and administrative expenses. the personnel expense increase was driven by an average headcount increase of 9.3 percent, primarily due to the addition of milgram. the selling, general, and administrative expense increase was driven by increased investments in technology, occupancy, and purchased services, including those from acquisitions.
global forwarding income from operations decreased 0.2 percent in 2018 to $91.6 million from $91.8 million in 2017. this was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses mostly offset by an increase in net revenues discussed above.

consolidated results of operations - 2017 compared to 2016
total revenues and direct costs. transportation total revenues increased 15.4 percent to $13.5 billion in 2017 from $11.7 billion in 2016. this increase in transportation total revenues was driven by volume increases in all of our transportation services and increased customer pricing in most services. total purchased transportation and related services increased 17.9 percent in 2017 to $11.3 billion from $9.5 billion in 2016. this increase was due to increased transportation costs and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation services. sourcing total revenues decreased 5.1 percent to $1.37 billion in 2017 from $1.44 billion in 2016. purchased products sourced for resale decreased 5.5 percent in 2017 to $1.2 billion from $1.3 billion in 2016. these decreases were primarily due to lower market pricing and change in service mix. our consolidated total revenues earned from customers within the united states increased 9.5 percent to $12.9 billion in 2017 from $11.7 billion in 2016.
29
net revenues. total transportation net revenues increased 4.2 percent in 2017 to $2.25 billion from $2.15 billion in 2016. our transportation net revenue margin decreased to 16.6 percent in 2017 from 18.4 percent in 2016. this decrease in net revenue margin was driven by increases in transportation costs, including fuel. total sourcing net revenues decreased 0.2 percent to $122.4 million in 2017 from $122.7 million in 2016. this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue per case, partially offset by a case volume increase across a variety of commodities and services. sourcing net revenue margin increased to 9.0 percent in 2017 from 8.5 percent in 2016.
operating expenses. operating expenses consist of personnel and selling, general, and administrative expenses. operating expenses increased 10.6 percent to $1.6 billion in 2017 from $1.4 billion in 2016. this was due to an increase of 10.8 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 10.2 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. as a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses increased to 67.3 percent in 2017 from 63.2 percent in 2016.
our personnel expenses are driven primarily by headcount and earnings growth. in 2017, personnel expenses increased 10.8 percent to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion in 2016. personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2017 to 49.8 percent from 46.8 percent in 2016. the increase in personnel expense was due primarily to growth in our average headcount of 7.4 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 and increases in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability.
other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 10.2 percent to $413.4 million in 2017 from $375.1 million in 2016. this increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in acquisition amortization, warehousing and occupancy expenses, and the provision for bad debt, partially offset by a decrease in travel expenses and claims.
income from operations. income from operations decreased 7.5 percent to $775.1 million in 2017 from $837.5 million in 2016. income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 32.7 percent in 2017 from 36.8 percent in 2016. this decrease was due to our operating expenses growing more than our net revenues and a decline in transportation net revenue margin.
interest and other expenses. interest and other expenses were $46.7 million in 2017 compared to $25.6 million in 2016. the increase was primarily due to a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates in 2017 compared to 2016.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 30.7 percent for 2017 and 36.8 percent for 2016. during the fourth quarter of 2017, the provision for income taxes decreased by $19.7 million due to the benefit of deductions under section 199 of the internal revenue code and $12.1 million due to the impact of the tax act, which was signed into law on december 22, 2017. the $12.1 million benefit resulting from the tax act was primarily the result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and was partially offset by the impact of certain transition taxes and other impacts of the tax act.
during the first quarter of 2017, we adopted asu 2016-09, compensation - stock compensation (topic 718). the adoption of asu 2016-09 prospectively impacts the recording of income taxes related to share-based payment awards in our consolidated financial position and results of operations, as well as the operating and financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. this adoption resulted in a net tax benefit of $13.7 million during the year.
during the first quarter of 2016, we asserted that we will indefinitely reinvest earnings of foreign subsidiaries to support expansion of our international businesses. during 2017, our indefinite reinvestment strategy with respect to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, provided an approximate $3.7 million benefit to our provision for income taxes. if we repatriated all foreign earnings, the estimated effect on income taxes payable would be an increase of approximately $12.1 million as of december 31, 2017.
net income. net income decreased 1.7 percent to $504.9 million in 2017 from $513.4 million in 2016. basic net income per share decreased 0.3 percent to $3.59 in 2017 from $3.60 in 2016. diluted net income per share decreased 0.6 percent to $3.57 in 2017 from $3.59 in 2016.
segment results of operations - 2017 compared to 2016
north american surface transportation. nast total revenues increased 11.3 percent to $9.7 billion in 2017 compared to $8.7 billion in 2016. this was primarily due to increased volumes and increased pricing to our customers. nast cost of purchased transportation and related services increased 13.7 percent to $8.2 billion in 2017 from $7.2 billion in 2016. this increase was primarily due to increased volumes and higher transportation costs. total nast net revenues were flat at $1.5 billion in 2017. this was driven by a decline in truckload and intermodal net revenues, partially offset by an increase in
30
ltl net revenues. nast net revenue margin decreased primarily due to transportation costs growing faster than customer pricing in 2017 compared to 2016.
nast truckload net revenues decreased 1.8 percent in 2017 to $1.09 billion from $1.11 billion in 2016. nast truckload volumes increased approximately 4.5 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. nast truckload net revenue margin decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to increased transportation costs.
nast truckload net revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total north america truckload net revenues in 2017 and approximately 92 percent in 2016. the majority of the remaining north american truckload net revenues is included in robinson fresh. excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel prices, our average north america truckload rate per mile charged to our customers increased approximately 4.5 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel prices, our average north america truckload transportation cost per mile increased approximately 6.5 percent in 2017 compared to 2016.
nast ltl net revenues increased 6.2 percent in 2017 to $388.8 million from $366.1 million in 2016. nast ltl volumes increased approximately eight percent in 2017 compared to 2016 and net revenue margin decreased. nast ltl net revenue margin decreased due to increased transportation costs.
nast intermodal net revenues decreased 14.6 percent to $26.7 million in 2017 from $31.3 million in 2016. this was primarily due to declines in net revenue margin, partially offset by increased volumes with our lower-margin contractual customers, partially offset by a decrease in transactional business.
nast operating expenses increased 5.5 percent in 2017 to $897.0 million from $849.9 million in 2016. this was due to an increase in personnel expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability, and an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. the operating expenses of nast and all other segments include allocated corporate expenses.
nast income from operations decreased 6.9 percent to $628.1 million in 2017 from $674.4 million in 2016. this was primarily due to increases in operating expenses, while net revenues remained flat.
global forwarding. global forwarding total revenues increased 36.0 percent to $2.1 billion in 2017 from $1.6 billion in 2016. this increase was primarily related to increased volumes in all services and increased customer pricing. global forwarding costs of transportation and related services increased 40.7 percent to $1.7 billion in 2017 from $1.2 billion in 2016. global forwarding net revenues increased 22.1 percent to $485.3 million in 2017 from $397.5 million in 2016. global forwarding net revenue margin decreased due to transportation costs increasing at a faster rate than customer pricing. the acquisitions of apc and milgram accounted for approximately eight percentage points of the net revenue growth in global forwarding.
ocean transportation net revenues increased 19.1 percent to $290.8 million in 2017 from $244.2 million in 2016. this was primarily due to increases in volumes, including those from acquisitions. air net revenues increased 24.1 percent to $94.5 million in 2017 from $76.1 million in 2016. this was primarily due to increases in volumes partially offset by cost increases. customs net revenues increased 40.5 percent to $70.9 million in 2017 from $50.5 million in 2016. the increase was primarily due to increased transaction volumes, including those from acquisitions.
global forwarding operating expenses increased 24.3 percent in 2017 to $393.4 million from $316.6 million in 2016. this increase was due to increases in both personnel and selling, general, and administrative expenses. the personnel expense increase was driven by an average headcount increase of 17.3 percent, primarily due to the additions of apc and milgram. the selling, general, and administrative expense increase was also primarily driven by the additions of apc and milgram.
global forwarding income from operations increased 13.5 percent in 2017 to $91.8 million from $80.9 million in 2016. this was primarily due to an increase in net revenues driven by increased volumes and customer pricing, partially offset by increased operating expenses.
robinson fresh. robinson fresh total revenues increased 3.1 percent to $2.4 billion in 2017 from $2.3 billion in 2016. robinson fresh costs of transportation and related services and purchased products sourced for resale increased 3.8 percent to $2.2 billion in 2017 from $2.1 billion in 2016. robinson fresh net revenues decreased 3.7 percent to $226.1 million in 2017 from $234.8 million in 2016. this decrease was primarily due to declines in transportation net revenues.
robinson fresh sourcing net revenues decreased 0.2 percent to $122.4 million in 2017 from $122.7 million in 2016. this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue per case, partially offset by a one percent case volume increase. robinson fresh net revenues from transportation services decreased 7.5 percent to $103.6 million in 2017 from $112.1 million in 2016. this decrease was driven by a decline in truckload net revenues, partially offset by an increase in other transportation
31
net revenues. robinson fresh transportation net revenue margin decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to increased costs of transportation.
robinson fresh operating expenses increased 8.6 percent to $172.7 million in 2017 from $159.0 million in 2016. this was due to increases in both selling, general, and administrative and personnel expenses. the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was due to higher warehousing and claims expenses in 2017 compared to 2016. in 2017, personnel expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salaries and an increase in average headcount of 1.6 percent in 2017 compared to 2016.
robinson fresh income from operations decreased 29.5 percent to $53.4 million in 2017 from $75.8 million in 2016. this was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in net revenues.
all other and corporate. all other and corporate includes our managed services segment, as well as other surface transportation outside of north america and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. managed services provides transportation management services, or managed tms. other surface transportation revenues are primarily earned by europe surface transportation. europe surface transportation provides services similar to nast across europe.
managed services net revenues increased 11.5 percent to $72.2 million in 2017 from $64.7 million in 2016. this increase was primarily due to volume growth with new and existing customers. other surface transportation net revenues increased 5.9 percent to $59.5 million in 2017 from $56.1 million in 2016. this increase is primarily the result of volume growth, partially offset by margin compression in the surface transportation business in europe.
liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated substantial cash from operations, which has enabled us to fund our organic growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock. in addition, we maintain the following debt facilities as described in note 4, financing arrangements (dollars in thousands):

(1) net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs.
we also expect to use the revolving credit facility, and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future, to assist us in continuing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases.
cash and cash equivalents totaled $378.6 million and $333.9 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017. cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled $320.0 million and $275.3 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017. working capital at december 31, 2018, was $1.3 billion. working capital at december 31, 2017, was $523.5 million.
we prioritize our investments to grow the business, as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow. we are continually looking for acquisitions, but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities.
cash flow from operating activities. we generated $792.9 million, $384.0 million, and $529.4 million of cash flow from operations in 2018, 2017, and 2016. the increase of $408.9 million in cash flow from operations in 2018 from 2017 is primarily the result of increased earnings and improved working capital performance including improved collections of accounts receivable. the decrease of $145.4 million in cash flow from operations in 2017 from 2016 is primarily the result of increased working capital driven by the impact of increased volumes and an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable balance.
32
cash used for investing activities. we used $72.8 million, $107.5 million, and $313.0 million of cash for investing activities in 2018, 2017, and 2016. our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions. in 2017, we paid $47.3 million for the acquisition of milgram. in 2016, we paid $220.2 million for the acquisition of apc.
we used $63.9 million, $57.9 million, and $91.4 million of cash for capital expenditures in 2018, 2017, and 2016. we spent $34.8 million, $29.0 million, and $25.0 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016 primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems, including the purchase and development of software. these information technology investments are intended to increase employee productivity, automate interactions with our customers and contracted carriers, and improve our internal workflows to help expand our operating margins and grow the business. additionally, in 2016, we completed construction of a second data recovery center. the cost of this data recovery center was $20.0 million, $19.3 million of which was spent in 2016.
we anticipate capital expenditures in 2019 to be approximately $80 to $90 million.
cash used for financing activities. we used $655.2 million, $202.1 million, and $127.3 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2018, 2017, and 2016.
we had net short-term repayments of $710.0 million in 2018 and $25.0 million in 2017 and net short-term borrowings of $290.0 million in 2016.
the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was $5.0 million as of december 31, 2018.
during 2018, we had long-term borrowings of $591.6 million, net of underwriting discounts and issuance costs on the senior notes. during 2017, we had long-term borrowings of $250.0 million on the receivables securitization facility. the outstanding balance on the receivables securitization facility was $250.0 million as of december 31, 2018. we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit agreement, note purchase agreement, receivables securitization facility, and senior notes as of december 31, 2018.
we used $265.2 million, $258.2 million, and $245.4 million to pay cash dividends in 2018, 2017, and 2016. the increases were primarily the result of higher dividend rates, partially offset by fewer outstanding shares.
we used $21.3 million, $21.6 million, and $36.7 million for stock tendered for payment of withholding taxes in 2018, 2017, and 2016.
we also used $301.0 million, $185.5 million, and $172.9 million on share repurchases in 2018, 2017, and 2016, as part of our board approved repurchase program. in august 2018, the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15,000,000 shares. as of december 31, 2018, there were 13,673,080 shares remaining for future repurchases. the number of shares we repurchase, if any, during future periods will vary based on our cash position, potential alternative uses of our cash, and market conditions.
assuming no change in our current business plan, management believes that our available cash, together with expected future cash generated from operations, the amount available under our credit facility, and credit available in the market, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months. we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice, if needed.
recently issued accounting pronouncements. refer to note 12, recently issued accounting pronouncements, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k. we consider the following items in our consolidated financial statements to require significant estimation or judgment.
33
revenue recognition. at contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify our performance obligations to provide distinct goods and services to our customers. our transportation and logistics service arrangements often require management to use judgment and make estimates that impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition.
transportation and logistics services - as a third party logistics provider, our primary performance obligation under our customer contracts is to utilize our relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies to efficiently and cost-effectively transport our customers' freight. revenue is recognized for these performance obligations as they are satisfied over the contract term, which generally represents the transit period. the transit period can vary based upon the method of transport, generally a couple days for over the road, rail, and air transportation, or several weeks in the case of an ocean shipment. determining the transit period and how much of it has been completed as of the reporting date may require management to make judgments that affect the timing of revenue recognized. we utilize our historical knowledge of shipping lanes and estimated transit times to determine the transit period in cases where our customers' freight has not reached its intended destination as of the reporting date. disruptions such as weather events or other delays could cause the actual transit period to differ from these estimates.
total revenues represent the total dollar value of revenue recognized from contracts with customers for the goods and services we provide. substantially all of our revenue is attributable to contracts with our customers. our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services, including contracted motor carrier, rail, ocean, air, and other costs, and the purchase price and services related to the products we source. most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell. in these transactions, we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to our customer and we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. additionally, in our sourcing business, in some cases we take inventory risk before the specified good has been transferred to our customer. customs brokerage, managed services, freight forwarding, and sourcing managed procurement transactions are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present. see also note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, for further information regarding our revenue recognition policies.
goodwill. goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed.
goodwill is tested for impairment annually on november 30, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value ("step zero analysis"). if the step zero analysis indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value, an additional impairment assessment is performed ("step 1 analysis"). based on our step zero analysis, we determined that the more likely than not criteria had not been met, and therefore a step 1 analysis was not required.
when we perform a step 1 analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
in the step 1 analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach. projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and the appropriate discount rate. use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded companies that are similar in size and industry. actual results may differ from those used in our valuations when a step 1 analysis is performed.

_______________________
(1)   amounts payable relate to the semi-annual interest due on the senior and long-term notes and the principal amount at maturity.
(2)   in addition to minimum lease payments, we are typically responsible under our lease agreements to pay our pro rata share of maintenance expenses, common charges, and real estate taxes of the buildings in which we lease space.
(3)   purchase obligations include agreements for services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. as of december 31, 2018, such obligations include ocean and air freight capacity, telecommunications services, and maintenance contracts.
we have no capital lease obligations. long-term liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable, long-term notes payable, and the obligation under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2018, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. therefore, $38.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. see note 5, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes. the obligation under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain. as of december 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.

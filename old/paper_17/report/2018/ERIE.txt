item 1a.     risk factors our business involves various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those discussed in this section.  the risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors below, or any additional risk outside of those discussed below, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, or liquidity if they were to develop into actual events.  this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in other reports and materials we file periodically with the securities and exchange commission.
if the management fee rate paid by the exchange is reduced or if there is a significant decrease in the amount of direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange, revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.
we are dependent upon management fees paid by the exchange, which represent our principal source of revenue.  pursuant to the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the exchange, we may retain up to 25% of all direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange.  therefore, management fee revenue from the exchange is calculated by multiplying the management fee rate by the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange.  accordingly, any reduction in direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange and/or the management fee rate would have a negative effect on our revenues and net income.
the management fee rate is determined by our board of directors and may not exceed 25% of the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange.  the board of directors sets the management fee rate each december for the following year.  at their discretion, the rate can be changed at any time.  the process of setting the management fee rate includes the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both indemnity and the exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position. the evaluation of these factors could result in a reduction to the management fee rate and our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.

serving as the attorney-in-fact in the reciprocal insurance exchange structure results in the exchange being our sole customer. we have an interest in the growth of the exchange as our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. if the exchange's ability to grow or renew policies were adversely impacted, the premium revenue of the exchange would be adversely affected which would reduce our management fee revenue. the circumstances or events that might impair the exchange's ability to grow include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.
unfavorable changes in macroeconomic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the exchange's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the exchange, and consequently our management fee.
the exchange faces significant competition from other regional and national insurance companies. the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis of product, price and service. if the exchange's competitors offer property and casualty products with more coverage or offer lower rates, and the exchange is unable to implement product improvements quickly enough to keep pace, its ability to grow and renew its business may be adversely impacted. in addition, due to the exchange's premium concentration in the automobile and homeowners insurance markets, it may be more sensitive to trends that could affect auto and home insurance coverages and rates over time, for example changing vehicle usage, usage-based methods of determining premiums, ownership and driving patterns such as ride sharing, advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features such as accident and loss prevention technologies, the development of autonomous vehicles, or residential occupancy patterns, among other factors.
the exchange markets and sells its insurance products through independent, non-exclusive insurance agencies. these agencies are not obligated to sell only the exchange's insurance products, and generally also sell products of the exchange's competitors. if agencies do not maintain their current levels of marketing efforts, bind the exchange to unacceptable risks, place business with competing insurers, or the exchange is unsuccessful in attracting or retaining agencies in its distribution system as well as maintaining its relationships with those agencies, the exchange's ability to grow and renew its business may be adversely impacted. additionally, consumer preferences may cause the insurance industry as a whole to migrate to a delivery system other than independent agencies.
the exchange maintains a brand recognized for customer service.  the perceived performance, actions, conduct and behaviors of employees, independent insurance agency representatives, and third-party service partners may result in reputational harm to the exchange's brand. specific incidents which may cause harm include but are not limited to disputes, long customer wait times, errors in processing a claim, failure to protect sensitive customer data, and negative or inaccurate social media communications. likewise, an inability to match or exceed the service provided by competitors, which is increasingly relying on digital delivery and enhanced distribution technology, may impede the exchange's ability to maintain and/or grow its customer base. if third-party service providers fail to perform as anticipated, the exchange may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and reputational damage. if an extreme catastrophic event were to occur in a heavily concentrated geographic area of subscribers/policyholders, an extraordinarily high number of claims could have the potential to strain claims processing and affect the exchange's ability to satisfy its customers. any reputational harm to the exchange could have the potential to impair its ability to grow and renew its business.
we also have an interest in the financial condition of the exchange based on serving as the attorney-in-fact in the reciprocal insurance exchange structure and the exchange being our sole customer. our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. if the exchange were to fail to maintain acceptable financial strength ratings, its competitive position in the insurance industry would be adversely affected. if a rating downgrade led to customers not renewing or canceling policies, or impacted the exchange's ability to attract new customers, the premium revenue of the exchange would be adversely affected which would reduce our management fee revenue. the circumstances or events that might impair the exchange's financial condition include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.
financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies such as the exchange. higher ratings generally indicate greater financial stability and a stronger ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. the exchange's a.m. best rating is currently a+ ("superior").  rating agencies periodically review insurers' ratings and change their rating criteria; therefore, the exchange's current rating may not be maintained in the future. a significant downgrade in this or other ratings would reduce the competitive position of the exchange, making it more difficult to attract profitable business in the highly competitive property and casualty insurance market and potentially result in reduced sales of its products and lower premium revenue.

the performance of the exchange's investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks. the exchange's investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed income securities, equity securities and limited partnerships. the fixed income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to, interest rate risk, investment credit risk, sector/concentration risk and liquidity risk. the exchange's common stock and preferred equity securities have exposure to price risk, the risk of potential loss in estimated fair value resulting from an adverse change in prices. limited partnerships are significantly less liquid and generally involve higher degrees of price risk than publicly traded securities. limited partnerships, like publicly traded securities, have exposure to market volatility; but unlike fixed income securities, cash flows and return expectations are less predictable. if any investments in the exchange's investment portfolio were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, the exchange's financial position could be materially adversely affected through increased unrealized losses or impairments. a significant decrease in the exchange's portfolio could also put it, or its subsidiaries, at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory or rating agency minimum capital requirements.
property and casualty insurers are subject to extensive regulatory supervision in the states in which they do business. this regulatory oversight includes, by way of example, matters relating to licensing, examination, rate setting, market conduct, policy forms, limitations on the nature and amount of certain investments, claims practices, mandated participation in involuntary markets and guaranty funds, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, restrictions on underwriting standards, accounting standards, and transactions between affiliates.  such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of policyholders. changes in applicable insurance laws, regulations, or changes in the way regulators administer those laws or regulations could adversely change the exchange's operating environment and increase its exposure to loss or put it at a competitive disadvantage, which could result in reduced sales of its products and lower premium revenue.
as insurance industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. in some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after the exchange has issued the affected insurance policies. as a result, the full extent of liability under the exchange's insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued. these issues may adversely affect the exchange's business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims.
the exchange's insurance operations are exposed to claims arising out of catastrophes. common natural catastrophic events include hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, hail storms, and severe winter weather. the frequency and severity of these catastrophes is inherently unpredictable. changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters and have created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. a single catastrophic occurrence or aggregation of multiple smaller occurrences within its geographical region could adversely affect the financial condition of the exchange. terrorist attacks could also cause losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations. the exchange could incur large net losses if terrorist attacks were to occur which could adversely affect its financial condition.
if the costs of providing services to the exchange are not controlled, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.
pursuant to the subscriber's agreement, we perform policy issuance and renewal services for the subscribers at the exchange and we serve as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange with respect to its administrative services. the most significant costs we incur in providing policy issuance and renewal services are commissions, employee costs, and technology costs.
commissions to independent agents are our largest expense.  commissions include scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving certain targeted measures.  changes to commission rates or bonus programs may result in increased future costs and lower profitability.
our second largest expense is employee costs, including salaries, healthcare, pension, and other benefit costs.  regulatory developments, provider relationships, and demographic and economic factors that are beyond our control indicate that employee healthcare costs could continue to increase. although we actively manage these cost increases, there can be no assurance that future cost increases will not occur and reduce our profitability. the defined benefit pension plan we offer to our employees is affected by variable factors such as the interest rate used to discount pension liabilities, asset performance and changes in retirement patterns, which are beyond our control and any related future costs increases would reduce our profitability.
technological development is necessary to facilitate ease of doing business for employees, agents and customers. insurance company technological developments are focused on simplifying and improving the customer experience, increasing efficiencies, redesigning products and addressing other potentially disruptive changes in the insurance industry. as we continue
7
to develop technology initiatives in order to remain competitive, our profitability could be negatively impacted as we invest in system development projects.
we are subject to credit risk from the exchange because the management fees from the exchange are not paid immediately when premiums are written.
we recognize a significant portion of management fees due from the exchange as income when the premiums are written because at that time we have performed substantially all of the services we are required to perform related to policy issuance and renewal.  however, the management fees are not paid to us by the exchange until the exchange collects the premiums from subscribers/policyholders.  as a result, we hold receivables for management fees on premiums that have been written and assumed by the exchange but not yet collected.  we also hold receivables from the exchange for claims related and administrative costs for which we are reimbursed at actual costs. these costs are settled monthly.  the receivable from the exchange totaled $449.9 million, or approximately 25% of our total assets at december 31, 2018.
our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented executives, key managers, and employees is critical to our success.
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key management.  the loss of the services and leadership of certain key officers and the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could prevent us from successfully communicating, implementing, and executing business strategies, and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our success also depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a talented employee base.  the inability to staff all functions of our business with employees possessing the appropriate technical expertise, or our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees, could have an adverse effect on our business performance.  staffing appropriately skilled employees for the handling of claims and servicing of customers, rendering of disciplined underwriting, and effective sales and marketing are critical to the core functions of our business. in addition, skilled employees in the actuarial, finance, human resources, law, and information technology areas are also essential to support our core functions.
if we are unable to ensure system availability or effectively manage technology initiatives, we may experience adverse financial consequences and/or may be unable to compete effectively.
our business is highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our technology and information systems which support key functions of our core business operations including processing applications and premium payments, providing customer support, performing actuarial and financial analysis, and maintaining key data. additionally, the exchange relies heavily on technology systems for processing claims. in order to support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner, we must maintain the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continue to both develop new, and enhance existing, technology systems. as we invest in the development of our systems, costs and completion times could exceed original estimates, and/or the project may not deliver the anticipated benefit, or perform as expected. if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology systems, our ability to serve our customers and implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted.
we utilize third-party software for certain technology and business process functions. if our third-party software vendors are subjected to intellectual property infringement claims, we may lose the ability to use their software until the dispute is resolved.
additionally, we depend on a large amount of data to price policies appropriately, track exposures, perform financial analysis, report to regulatory bodies, and ultimately make business decisions. should this data be inaccurate or insufficient, risk exposure may be underestimated and/or poor business decisions may be made. this may in turn lead to adverse operational or financial performance and adverse customer or investor confidence.
if we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security, including as a result of cyber attacks, third-party relationships or cloud-based relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be adversely impacted.
in the normal course of business we collect, use, store and where appropriate, disclose data concerning individuals and businesses. we also conduct business using third-party vendors who may provide software, data storage, cloud-based computing and other technology services. like other companies, we have on occasion experienced, and will continue to experience, cyber threats to our data and systems. cyber threats can create significant risks such as destruction of systems or data, denial of service, disruption of transaction execution, loss or exposure of customer data, theft or exposure of our intellectual property, theft of funds or disruption of other important business functions. the business we conduct with our
8
third-party vendors may expose us to increased risk related to data security, service disruptions or effectiveness of our control system.
in addition, we are subject to numerous federal and state data privacy laws relating to the privacy of the nonpublic personal information of our customers, employees and others. the misuse or mishandling of information sent to or received from a customer, employee or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational damage. third parties on whom we rely for certain business processing functions are also subject to these risks, and their failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could negatively impact us.
we employ a company-wide cybersecurity program of technical, administrative, physical and disclosure controls intended to reduce the risk of cyber threats and protect our information, as well as to communicate potential material threats and incidents. our cybersecurity philosophy and approach align to the national institute of standards and technology cybersecurity framework and its core elements to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from the various forms of cyber threats. our practices include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity protocols and controls, system monitoring and detection, communication of incidents to appropriate management, vendor risk management, and ongoing privacy and cybersecurity training for employees and contractors concerning cyber risk. we periodically assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity efforts including independent validation and verification and security assessments conducted by independent third parties. the number, complexity and sophistication of cyber threats continue to increase over time. the controls we have implemented, and continue to develop, may not be sufficient to prevent events like unauthorized physical or electronic access, denial of service, cyber attacks, or other security breaches to our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. in some cases, such events may not be immediately detected and/or the impact of such events immediately determined.
our board of directors oversees our activities with respect to managing cyber risk through a specific cybersecurity subcommittee. management periodically reports on our cybersecurity risk management program including our risk evaluation and the results of independent third party security assessments, and our efforts to mitigate cyber related risks.
to date, we are not aware of any material cybersecurity breach with respect to our systems or data. any cyber incident or other security breach could cause disruption in our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including significant remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny, fines, litigation, monetary damages and reputational harm. while we maintain cyber liability insurance to mitigate the financial risk around cyber incidents, such insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of information or systems being compromised. as a result, in the event of a material cybersecurity breach, our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.
if events occurred causing interruption of our operations, facilities, systems or business functions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
we have an established business continuity plan to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal business operations could not be performed due to a catastrophic event. while we continue to test and assess our business continuity plan to ensure it meets the needs of our core business operations and addresses multiple business interruption events, there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed upon the occurrence of such an event.  systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform our business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. our business continuity is also dependent on third-party systems on which our information technology systems interface and rely.  our systems and those of our third-party vendors may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, and viruses. the failure of our information systems for any reason could result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations.
the performance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed income securities.  at december 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted of approximately 88% fixed income securities. the remaining 12% is comprised of other investments, limited partnerships and equity securities.
all of our marketable securities are subject to market volatility.  to the extent that future market volatility negatively impacts our investments, our financial condition will be negatively impacted.  we review the investment portfolio on a continuous basis to evaluate positions that might have incurred other-than-temporary declines in value. inherent in management's evaluation of
9
a security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. the primary factors considered in our review of investment valuation include the extent and duration to which fair value is less than cost, historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer, short- and long-term prospects of the issuer and its industry, specific events that occurred affecting the issuer, including rating downgrades, and, depending on the type of security, our intent to sell or our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value.  as the process for determining impairments is highly subjective, changes in our assessments may have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition. see also item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk".
if the fixed income, equity, or limited partnership portfolios were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected through increased realized/unrealized losses or impairments.
the performance of the fixed income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to:
•   interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates.
•   investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss.
•   sector/concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries, or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated within those issuers, sectors, or industries.
•   liquidity risk - the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when desired. disruptions in the financial markets or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us.
general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the realization of net investment income, or result in realized investment losses. in addition, downward economic trends also may have an adverse effect on our investment results by negatively impacting the business conditions and impairing credit for the issuers of securities held in our respective investment portfolios.  this could reduce fair values of investments and generate significant unrealized losses or impairment charges which may adversely affect our financial results.
in addition to the fixed income securities, a portion of our portfolio is invested in limited partnerships.  at december 31, 2018, we had investments in limited partnerships of $34.8 million, or 2% of total assets.  while we have an obligation to invest up to an additional $12.2 million in limited partnerships, including private equity, mezzanine debt, and real estate partnership investments, the potential of the partnerships calling for the satisfaction of these obligations is low given the age of these investments.  limited partnerships are significantly less liquid and generally involve higher degrees of price risk, the risk of potential loss in estimated fair value resulting from an adverse change in prices, than publicly traded securities.  limited partnerships, like publicly traded securities, have exposure to market volatility; but unlike fixed income securities, cash flows and return expectations are less predictable.  we have made no new limited partnership commitments since 2006, and the balance of limited partnership investments is expected to decline over time as additional distributions are received.
the primary basis for the valuation of limited partnership interests are financial statements prepared by the general partner.  because of the timing of the preparation and delivery of these financial statements, the use of the most recently available financial statements provided by the general partners result in a quarter delay in the inclusion of the limited partnership results in our statements of operations.  due to this delay, our financial statements at december 31, 2018 do not reflect market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018.
our equity securities have exposure to price risk.  we do not hedge our exposure to equity price risk inherent in our equity investments.  equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may also be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed income portfolio, as discussed above.
10
deteriorating capital and credit market conditions or a failure to accurately estimate capital needs may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital.
sufficient liquidity and capital levels are required to pay operating expenses, income taxes, and to provide the necessary resources to fund future growth opportunities, satisfy certain financial covenants, pay dividends on common stock, and repurchase common stock.  management estimates the appropriate level of capital necessary based upon current and projected results, which includes evaluating potential risks.  failure to accurately estimate our capital needs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition until additional sources of capital can be obtained.  further, a deteriorating financial condition may create a negative perception of us by third parties, including rating agencies, investors, financial institutions, agents, and customers which could impact our ability to access additional capital in the debt or equity markets.
our primary sources of liquidity are management fee revenue and cash flows generated from our investment portfolio.  in the event our current sources do not satisfy our liquidity needs, we have the ability to access our $100 million bank revolving line of credit, from which there were no borrowings as of december 31, 2018, or liquidate assets in our investment portfolio.  volatility in the financial markets could limit our ability to sell certain of our fixed income securities or cause such investments to sell at deep discounts.
in the event these traditional sources of liquidity are not available, we may have to seek additional financing.  our access to funds will depend upon a number of factors including current market conditions, the availability of credit, market liquidity, and credit ratings.  in deteriorating market conditions, there can be no assurance that we will obtain additional financing, or, if available, that the cost of financing will not substantially increase and affect our overall profitability.
we are subject to applicable insurance laws, tax statutes, and regulations, as well as claims and legal proceedings, which, if determined unfavorably, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
we face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses including the risk of class action lawsuits. our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate. in our operations, we are, have been, or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, payment of contingent or other sales commissions, product design, product disclosure, policy issuance and administration, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, charging excessive or impermissible fees on products, recommending unsuitable products to customers, and breaching alleged fiduciary or other duties, including our obligations to indemnify directors and officers in connection with certain legal matters. we are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities such as contractual and employment relationships and claims regarding the infringement of the intellectual property of others. plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, and books and record examinations from state and federal regulators and authorities. changes in the way regulators administer those laws, tax statutes, or regulations could adversely impact our business, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.
item 7.     management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations highlights significant factors influencing erie indemnity company ("indemnity", "we", "us", "our"). this discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes and all other items contained within this annual report on form 10-k as these contain important information helpful in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

recently adopted accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards codification 606, "revenue from contracts with customers" ("asc 606"). asc 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. (see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report.) we adopted asc 606 as of january 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
under asc 606, we determined that we are acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange in two capacities pursuant to the subscriber's agreement. the first is providing policy issuance and renewal services. the second is acting as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all claims handling, life insurance, and investment management services, collectively referred to as "administrative services". beginning january 1, 2018, the management fee, currently 25% of all direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange, is allocated between the two performance obligations. prior to the adoption of asc 606, the entire management fee was allocated to the policy issuance and renewal services. additionally, the expenses we incur and related reimbursements we receive for administrative services are presented gross in our statement of operations effective january 1, 2018.
a significant portion of the management fee is allocated to the policy issuance and renewal services and recognized at a point in time, i.e. the time of policy issuance or renewal. therefore, the related revenue recognition pattern for the vast majority of our revenues remains unchanged. the management fee allocated to the administrative services is recognized as revenue over a four-year period in correlation to costs incurred. upon adoption at january 1, 2018, we established a contract liability related to the administrative services of $48.5 million, a deferred tax asset of $10.2 million, and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment that reduced shareholders' equity by $38.3 million. if asc 606 had been effective in 2017, based on current estimates our revenue would have been reduced by approximately $2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
recent accounting standards see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for a discussion of other recently adopted as well as recently issued accounting standards and the impact on our financial statements if known.
operating overview overview we are a pennsylvania business corporation that since 1925 has been the managing attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the erie insurance exchange ("exchange"), a reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance. our primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange. we also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.
the exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange, which is an unincorporated association of individuals, partnerships and corporations that agree to insure one another. each applicant for insurance to the exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the exchange on their behalf.

pursuant to the subscriber's agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we earn a management fee. management fee revenue is based upon all direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange and the management fee rate, which is not to exceed 25%. our board of directors establishes the management fee rate at least annually, generally in december for the following year.  the process of setting the management fee rate includes the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both indemnity and the exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position. the management fee rate was set at 25% for 2018, 2017 and 2016.  our board of directors set the 2019 management fee rate again at 25%, its maximum level.
our earnings are primarily driven by the management fee revenue generated for the services we provide to the exchange.  the policy issuance and renewal services we provide to the exchange are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies. the sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services. agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving targeted measures. agent compensation comprised approximately 67% of our 2018 policy issuance and renewal expenses. the underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately 10% of our 2018 policy issuance and renewal expenses. the remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support. we also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately 10% of our 2018 policy issuance and renewal expenses. included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.
by virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through an attorney-in-fact. indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange with respect to its administrative services. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions. life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business. investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds. included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions. the amounts incurred for these services are reimbursed to indemnity at cost in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements. state insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.
our results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the exchange as the exchange is our sole customer, and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. the exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 71% of the 2018 direct and assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 29%.  the principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  the principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.
we generate investment income from our fixed maturity, equity security, and limited partnership investment portfolios.  our portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis.  we actively evaluate the portfolios for impairments, and record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where the fair value of the investment is substantially below cost, and it is concluded that the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which includes consideration for intent to sell.

nm = not meaningful operating income increased $54.1 million in 2018 as the growth in total operating revenue outpaced the growth in total operating expenses. offsetting some of the increase in operating expenses in 2018 were lower agent and employee incentive costs related to less profitable growth. in 2017, operating income decreased $3.3 million primarily due to higher incentive compensation and information technology-related professional fees. management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $56.9 million and $95.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. management fee revenue allocated to administrative services was $53.6 million in 2018. no management fee revenue was allocated to administrative services in 2017 and 2016. management fee revenue is based upon the management fee rate we charge, and the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. the management fee rate was 25% for 2018, 2017 and 2016. the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 6.9% to $7.1 billion in 2018 and 6.0% to $6.7 billion in 2017. the administrative services reimbursement revenue and corresponding cost of operations increased both total operating revenue and total operating expenses by $580.3 million in 2018, but had no net impact on operating income.
cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 4.0% in 2018 primarily due to higher commissions driven by direct written premium growth, and increased 7.6% in 2017 driven by higher commissions, personnel costs and information technology-related professional fees.
total investment income decreased $2.8 million in 2018 driven by lower earnings generated from limited partnership investments and higher net realized investment losses, partially offset by higher net investment income. total investment income increased $0.8 million in 2017 driven by higher net investment income and net realized investment gains offset by lower earnings generated from limited partnership investments.
income tax expense was impacted by the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act on december 22, 2017, which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. income before income taxes increased $55.6 million in 2018 while income tax expense decreased $35.6 million due to the lower income tax rate. income tax expense increased $10.1 million in 2017 due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate.
general conditions and trends affecting our business economic conditions unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the exchange's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the exchange, and consequently our management fee.  further, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, construction and auto repair cost inflation, and tort issues may impact the estimated loss reserves and future premium rates. if any of these items impacted the financial condition or continuing operations of the exchange, it could have an impact on our financial results.
financial market volatility our portfolio of fixed maturity, equity security, and limited partnership investments is subject to market volatility especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets.  over time, net investment income could also be impacted by volatility and by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations. depending upon market conditions, which are unpredictable and remain uncertain, considerable fluctuation could exist in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
21
critical accounting estimates the financial statements include amounts based upon estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures.  we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2) different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period-to-period, could have a material impact on our statements of operations or financial position.
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment.  if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  the estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually, and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings.
investment valuation available-for-sale securities we make estimates concerning the valuation of all investments.  valuation techniques are used to derive the fair value of the available-for-sale securities we hold.  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date.
fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.  observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
for purposes of determining whether the market is active or inactive, the classification of a financial instrument is based upon the following definitions:
•   an active market is one in which transactions for the assets being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information.
•   an inactive (illiquid) market is one in which there are few and infrequent transactions, where the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially, and/or there is little information publicly available for the asset being valued.
we continually assess whether or not an active market exists for all of our investments and as of each reporting date re-evaluate the classification in the fair value hierarchy.  all assets carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
•   level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.
•   level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
•   level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
level 1 includes nonredeemable preferred stock and reflects market data obtained from independent sources, such as prices obtained from an exchange or a nationally recognized pricing service for identical instruments in active markets.
level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as the interest rate and credit spread for the underlying financial instruments.  all significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  financial instruments in this category primarily include u.s. government & agency securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, structured securities and certain nonredeemable preferred stock.
level 3 securities are valued based upon unobservable inputs, reflecting our estimates of value based upon assumptions used by market participants.  securities are assigned to level 3 in cases where non-binding broker quotes are significant to the
22
valuation and there is a lack of transparency as to whether these quotes are based upon information that is observable in the marketplace.  fair value estimates for securities valued using unobservable inputs require significant judgment due to the illiquid nature of the market for these securities and represent the best estimate of the fair value that would occur in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.  fair value for these securities are generally determined using non-binding broker quotes received from outside broker dealers based upon security type and market conditions.  remaining securities, where a price is not available, are valued using an estimate of fair value based upon indicative market prices that include significant unobservable inputs not based upon, nor corroborated by, market information, including the utilization of discounted cash flow analyses which have been risk-adjusted to take into account illiquidity and other market factors.  this category primarily consists of corporate bonds and structured securities priced using non-binding broker quotes.
as of each reporting period, financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  the presence of at least one unobservable input that has significant impact to the fair value measurement would result in classification as a level 3 instrument.  our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset, such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of including a particular input and market conditions.  we did not make any other significant judgments except as described above.
estimates of fair values for our investment portfolio are obtained primarily from a nationally recognized pricing service.  our level 1 category includes those securities valued using an exchange traded price provided by the pricing service.  the methodologies used by the pricing service that support a level 2 classification of a financial instrument include multiple verifiable, observable inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.  pricing service valuations for level 3 securities are based upon proprietary models and are used when observable inputs are not available in illiquid markets.  in limited circumstances we adjust the price received from the pricing service when, in our judgment, a better reflection of fair value is available based upon corroborating information and our knowledge and monitoring of market conditions such as a disparity in price of comparable securities and/or non-binding broker quotes. in other circumstances, certain securities are internally priced because prices are not provided by the pricing service.
we perform continuous reviews of the prices obtained from the pricing service.  this includes evaluating the methodology and inputs used by the pricing service to ensure we determine the proper classification level of the financial instrument.  price variances, including large periodic changes, are investigated and corroborated by market data.  we have reviewed the pricing methodologies of our pricing service as well as other observable inputs, such as market data and transaction volumes, and believe that the prices adequately consider market activity in determining fair value.
when a price from the pricing service is not available, values are determined by obtaining broker/dealer quotes and/or market comparables.  when available, we obtain multiple quotes for the same security.  the ultimate value for these securities is determined based upon our best estimate of fair value using corroborating market information.  our evaluation includes the consideration of benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.
other-than-temporary impairments investments are evaluated monthly for other-than-temporary impairment loss.  some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary include:
•   the extent and duration for which fair value is less than cost;
•   historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer;
•   short- and long-term prospects of the issuer and its industry based upon analysts' recommendations;
•   specific events that occurred affecting the issuer, including rating downgrades;
•   intent to sell or more likely than not we would be required to sell (debt securities); and
•   ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value (equity securities prior to the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-01, "financial instruments-overall").
for debt securities in which we do not expect full recovery of amortized cost, the security is deemed to be credit-impaired.  credit-related impairments and impairments on securities we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell are recorded in the statements of operations.  it is our intention to sell all debt securities with credit impairments.
23
limited partnerships the primary basis for the valuation of limited partnership interests is financial statements prepared by the general partner.  because of the timing of the preparation and delivery of these financial statements, the use of the most recently available financial statements provided by the general partners generally result in a quarter delay in the inclusion of the limited partnership results in our statements of operations.  due to this delay, these financial statements do not reflect the market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018.
the majority of our limited partnership holdings are considered investment companies where the general partners record assets at fair value. these limited partnerships are recorded using the equity method of accounting. we also own one real estate limited partnership that does not meet the criteria of an investment company. this partnership prepares audited financial statements on a cost basis. we have elected to report this limited partnership under the fair value option, which is based on the net asset value (nav) from our partner's capital statement reflecting the general partner's estimate of fair value for the fund's underlying assets. fair value provides consistency in the evaluation and financial reporting for this limited partnership and limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method.
we have three types of limited partnership investments: private equity, mezzanine debt, and real estate.  nearly all of the underlying investments in our limited partnerships are valued using a source other than quoted prices in active markets. the fair value amounts for our private equity and mezzanine debt partnerships are based upon the financial statements prepared by the general partners, who use various methods to estimate fair value including the market approach, income approach, and the cost approach.  the market approach uses prices and other pertinent information from market-generated transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.  such valuation techniques often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables.  the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows or earnings to a single discounted present value amount.  the measurement is based upon the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.  the cost approach is derived from the amount that is currently required to replace the service capacity of an asset.  if information becomes available that would impair the cost of investments owned by the partnerships, then the general partner would adjust the investments to the net realizable value.
the fair value of investments in real estate limited partnerships is determined by the general partner based upon independent appraisals and/or internal valuations.  real estate projects under development are generally valued at cost and impairment tested by the general partner.
while we perform various procedures in review of the general partners' valuations, we rely on the general partners' financial statements as the best available information to record our share of the partnership unrealized gains and losses resulting from valuation changes.  due to the limited market for these investments, there is higher potential for variability.  we survey each of the general partners quarterly about expected significant changes (plus or minus 10% compared to previous quarter) to valuations prior to the release of the fund's quarterly and annual financial statements. based upon that information from the general partner, we consider whether additional disclosure is warranted. we analyze the limited partnership measured at fair value based upon nav to determine if the most recently available nav reflects fair value at the balance sheet date, with an adjustment being made where appropriate (change of plus or minus 5% compared to most recent nav).
we have made no new limited partnership commitments since 2006, and the balance of limited partnership investments is expected to decline over time as additional distributions are received.
retirement benefit plans for employees our pension plans consist of a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan ("serp") for certain members of executive and senior management. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for approximately 59% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which includes pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and the exchange's allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions.
our pension obligation is developed from actuarial estimates.  several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans.  key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets.  we review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience, current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, and expected future trends.
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments.  we discount those cash payments based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information with maturities that correspond to
24
the payment of benefits.  lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense, while higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.  the construction of the yield curve is based upon yields of corporate bonds rated aa or equivalent quality.  target yields are developed from bonds at various maturity points and a curve is fitted to those targets.  spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the yield curve and used to discount benefit payment amounts associated with each future year.  the present value of plan benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.  a single discount rate is then developed to produce the same present value.  the cash flows from the yield curve were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan, which have a duration of about 18 years.  this yield curve supported the selection of a 4.47% discount rate for the projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2018 and for the 2019 pension expense.  the same methodology was used to develop the 3.73% and 4.24% discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation for 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the pension expense for 2018 and 2017, respectively. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would increase pension cost in the following year by $4.2 million, of which our share would be approximately $1.7 million, and would increase the pension benefit obligation by $39.0 million.
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets.  these unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the statements of financial position. these amounts are systematically recognized to net periodic pension expense in future periods, with gains decreasing and losses increasing future pension expense. if actuarial net gains or losses exceed 5% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the excess is recognized through the net periodic pension expense equally over the estimated service period of the employee group, which is currently 14 years.
the expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid.  to determine the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we utilized models based upon rigorous historical analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets based upon key factors such as historical returns for the asset class' applicable indices, the correlations of the asset classes under various market conditions and consensus views on future real economic growth and inflation.  the expected future return for each asset class is then combined by considering correlations between asset classes and the volatilities of each asset class to produce a reasonable range of asset return results within which our expected long-term rate of return assumption falls.  the expected long-term rate of return is less susceptible to annual revisions, as there are typically no significant changes in the asset mix.  in 2018, we changed our target asset allocation to reduce investment risk by shifting portfolio assets from equity securities to debt securities.  based on the current asset allocation and a review of the key factors and expectations of future asset performance, we reduced the expected return on asset assumption from 6.75% to 6.00% for 2019. a change of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $2.0 million impact on net pension benefit cost in the following year, of which our share would be approximately $0.8 million.
we use a four year averaging method to determine the market-related value of plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense.  under this methodology, asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a four year period.  the market-related asset experience during 2018 that related to the actual investment return being different from that assumed during the prior year was a loss of $89.6 million. recognition of this loss will be deferred and recognized over a four year period, consistent with the market-related asset value methodology.  once factored into the market-related asset value, these experience gains and losses will be amortized over a period of 14 years, which is the remaining service period of the employee group.
estimates of fair values of the pension plan assets are obtained primarily from the trustee and custodian of our pension plan.  our level 1 category includes a money market fund that is a mutual fund for which the fair value is determined using an exchange traded price provided by the trustee and custodian.  our level 2 category includes commingled pools.  estimates of fair values for securities held by our commingled pools are obtained primarily from the trustee and custodian.  the methodologies used by the trustee and custodian that support a financial instrument level 2 classification include multiple verifiable, observable inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuers spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data. there were no level 3 investments in 2018 or 2017.
we expect our net pension benefit costs to decrease from $36.3 million in 2018 to $30.7 million in 2019 primarily due to the higher discount rate, partially offset by less than expected asset returns during 2018. our share of the net pension benefit costs after reimbursements was $14.9 million in 2018. we expect our share of the net pension benefit costs to be approximately $12.6 million in 2019.
25
the actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension obligation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants.  while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. see part ii, item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on the pension plans.

results of operations management fee revenue on january 1, 2018, we adopted asc 606, "revenue from contracts with customers". upon adoption, we determined we have two performance obligations in the subscriber's agreement, providing policy issuance and renewal services and acting as attorney-in-fact for the exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services. we earn management fees for acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange in these two capacities. upon adoption of asc 606, we are required to allocate our revenues between our performance obligations. prior to the adoption of asc 606, the entire management fee was allocated to the policy issuance and renewal services.
management fee rate the management fee is calculated by multiplying all direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange by the management fee rate, which is determined by our board of directors at least annually.  the management fee rate was set at 25%, the maximum rate, for 2018, 2017 and 2016.  changes in the management fee rate can affect our revenue and net income significantly.
change in allowance for management fee returned on cancelled policies management fees are returned to the exchange when subscribers/policyholders cancel their insurance coverage mid-term and unearned premiums are refunded to them. we maintain an allowance for management fees returned on mid-year policy cancellations that recognizes the management fee anticipated to be returned to the exchange based on historical mid-term cancellation experience. our cash flows are unaffected by the recording of this allowance.
the following table presents the allocation and disaggregation of revenue for our two performance obligations:

(1)   management fees are returned to the exchange when policies are cancelled mid-term and unearned premiums are refunded. we record an estimated allowance for management fees returned on mid-term policy cancellations. this estimated allowance has been allocated between the two performance obligations consistent with the revenue allocation proportion.
(2)   the allocation of management fee revenue between the two performance obligations beginning january 1, 2018 caused the growth in management fee revenue - policy issuance and renewal services to not correspond directly with the growth in direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange in 2018, compared to 2017.
(3)   with the adoption of asc 606 effective january 1, 2018, management fee revenue - administrative services is recognized over time as the services are performed. see part ii, item 8.

direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange direct and assumed premiums include premiums written directly by the exchange and premiums assumed from its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries. direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 6.9% to $7.1 billion in 2018, from $6.7 billion in 2017, driven by increases in both policies in force and average premium per policy.  year-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased 3.3% in 2018 as the result of continuing strong policyholder retention, compared to 3.5% in 2017.  the year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 3.5% at december 31, 2018, compared to 2.4% at december 31, 2017.
premiums generated from new business increased 4.7% to $886 million in 2018.  while 2018 new business policies written decreased 1.4%, the year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 6.2% at december 31, 2018, driving this new business premium increase. premiums generated from new business increased 12.3% to $846 million in 2017. underlying this trend in new business premium was a 7.6% increase in new business policies written in 2017 and a year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increase of 4.4% at december 31, 2017.
premiums generated from renewal business increased 7.2% to $6.2 billion in 2018, compared to 5.2%, or $5.8 billion, in 2017.  underlying the trend in renewal business premiums were increases in average premium per policy and steady policy retention ratios. the renewal business year-over-year average premium per policy increased 3.1% at december 31, 2018, compared to 2.2% at december 31, 2017.
the exchange implemented rate increases in 2018, 2017, and 2016 in order to meet loss cost expectations.  as the exchange writes policies with annual terms only, rate actions take 12 months to be fully recognized in written premium and 24 months to be fully recognized in earned premiums.  since rate changes are realized at renewal, it takes 12 months to implement a rate change to all policyholders and another 12 months to earn the increased or decreased premiums in full.  as a result, certain rate actions approved in 2017 were reflected in 2018, and recent rate actions in 2018 will be reflected in 2019. the exchange continuously evaluates pricing and product offerings to meet consumer demands.
personal lines - total personal lines premiums written increased 6.6% to $5.0 billion in 2018, from $4.7 billion in 2017, driven by an increase of 3.4% in total personal lines policies in force and an increase of 3.3% in the total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy.
commercial lines - total commercial lines premiums written increased 7.5% to $2.1 billion in 2018, from $1.9 billion in 2017, driven by a 2.7% increase in total commercial lines policies in force and a 4.6% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy.
future trends-premium revenue - the exchange plans to continue its efforts to grow premiums and improve its competitive position in the marketplace.  expanding the size of its agency force through a careful agency selection process and increased market penetration in our existing operating territories is expected to contribute to future growth as existing and new agents build their books of business.
changes in premium levels attributable to the growth in policies in force directly affects the profitability of the exchange and has a direct bearing on our management fee.  our continued focus on underwriting discipline and the maturing of pricing sophistication models has contributed to the exchange's steady policy retention ratios and increased average premium per policy.  the continued growth of its policy base is dependent upon the exchange's ability to retain existing, and attract new, subscribers/policyholders.  a lack of new policy growth or the inability to retain existing customers could have an adverse effect on the exchange's premium level growth, and consequently our management fee.
changes in premium levels attributable to rate changes also directly affect the profitability of the exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee.  pricing actions contemplated or taken by the exchange are subject to various regulatory requirements of the states in which it operates.  the pricing actions already implemented, or to be implemented, have an effect on the market competitiveness of the exchange's insurance products.  such pricing actions, and those of the exchange's competitors, could affect the ability of the exchange's agents to retain and attract new business.  we expect the exchange's pricing actions to result in a net increase in direct written premium in 2019; however, exposure reductions and/or changes in mix of business as a result of economic conditions could impact the average premium written and assumed by the exchange, as customers may reduce coverages.

policy issuance and renewal services we allocate a portion of the management fee, which currently equates to 24.2% of the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange, for providing policy issuance and renewal services. this portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue when the policy is issued or renewed because it is at that time that the services we provide are substantially complete and the executed insurance policy is transferred to the customer. the increase in management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services was driven by the increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange discussed previously.
service agreement revenue service agreement revenue includes service charges we collect from subscribers/policyholders for providing extended payment terms on policies written and assumed by the exchange, and late payment and policy reinstatement fees.  the service charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment.  the decrease in service agreement revenue reflects the continued shift to payment plans that do not incur service charges or offer a premium discount for certain payment methods.

commissions - commissions increased $36.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of the 6.9% increase in direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange, somewhat offset by lower agent incentive costs related to less profitable growth. commissions increased $53.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of the 6.0% increase in direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange.
non-commission expense - non-commission expense increased $19.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $8.1 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and underwriting report costs. information technology costs increased $5.1 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and professional fees. customer service costs increased $4.4 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and credit card processing fees. personnel costs in all expense categories were impacted by additional bonuses awarded to all employees as a result of tax savings realized from the lower corporate income tax rate that became effective january 1, 2018 as well as increased medical costs. the total increase in personnel costs was somewhat offset by lower estimated costs for incentive plan awards related to underwriting performance.

in 2017, non-commission expense increased $44.7 million compared to 2016. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $7.0 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and underwriting report costs. information technology costs increased $19.2 million primarily due to increased professional fees, hardware and software costs and personnel costs. customer service costs increased $3.2 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and credit card processing fees. administrative and other costs increased $16.7 million primarily driven by increased personnel costs, including higher incentive plan costs.  the incentive plan cost increase was driven by an increase in long-term incentive plan cost due to the increase in the company stock price during 2017 coupled with lower incentive plan cost in the prior year due to incentive compensation that was forfeited by senior executives who separated from service during 2016.  additionally, the employee incentive plan program was expanded to additional employee groups beginning in 2017. personnel costs in all expense categories were impacted by increased medical and pension costs.

net realized losses were $2.0 million in 2018, compared to gains of $1.3 million in 2017 and $0.7 million in 2016. net realized losses in 2018 were due to losses from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities and decreases in fair value of equity securities. net realized gains in 2017 were primarily due to gains from the sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by losses from sales of equity securities, while gains in 2016 were primarily attributable to gains from sales of common stock trading securities.
net impairment losses recognized in earnings net impairment losses recognized in earnings were $1.6 million in 2018, compared to $0.2 million in 2017, and $0.4 million in 2016. net impairment losses recognized in earnings in all three years included securities in an unrealized loss position that we intended to sell prior to expected recovery of our amortized cost basis as well as securities in an unrealized loss position where we determined the loss was other-than-temporary based on credit factors.

limited partnership earnings pertain to investments in u.s. and foreign private equity, mezzanine debt, and real estate partnerships.  valuation adjustments are recorded to reflect the changes in fair value of the underlying investments held by the limited partnerships.  these adjustments are recorded as a component of equity in (losses) earnings of limited partnerships in the statements of operations.
limited partnership earnings tend to be cyclical based upon market conditions, the age of the partnership, and the nature of the investments.  generally, limited partnership earnings are recorded on a quarter lag from financial statements we receive from our general partners.  as a consequence, earnings from limited partnerships reported at december 31, 2018 reflect investment valuation changes resulting from the financial markets and the economy for the twelve month period ending september 30, 2018.
equity in earnings of limited partnerships decreased by $3.6 million in 2018, compared to 2017, and decreased by $4.2 million in 2017, compared to 2016. the decrease in earnings in 2018 was the result of lower earnings in all sectors. the decrease in earnings in 2017 was primarily the result of lower earnings in real estate investments that were partially offset by higher earnings from private equity investments.
financial condition of erie insurance exchange serving in the capacity of attorney-in-fact for the exchange, we are dependent on the growth and financial condition of the exchange, who is our sole customer. the strength of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries is rated annually by a.m. best company. higher ratings of insurance companies generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims. the ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors. the exchange and each of its property and casualty subsidiaries are rated a+ "superior". on june 18, 2018, the outlook for the financial strength rating was affirmed as stable. according to a.m. best, this second highest financial strength rating category is assigned to those companies that, in a.m. best's opinion, have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by a.m. best and have a superior ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term. only approximately 12% of insurance groups are rated a+ or higher, and the exchange is included in that group.
the financial statements of the exchange are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the commonwealth of pennsylvania. financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles focus on the solvency of the insurer and generally provide a more conservative approach than under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. statutory direct written premiums of the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries grew 6.9% to $7.1 billion in 2018 from $6.7 billion in 2017. these premiums, along with investment income, are the major sources of cash that support the operations of the exchange. policyholders' surplus, determined under statutory accounting principles, was $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries' year-over-year policy retention ratio continues to be high at 90.1% at december 31, 2018 and 89.6% at december 31, 2017.
financial condition investments our investment portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis.

we continually review our investment portfolio to evaluate positions that might incur other-than-temporary declines in value.  we record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where the fair value of the investment is substantially below cost, and we conclude that the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which includes consideration for intent to sell. for all investment holdings, general economic conditions and/or conditions specifically affecting the underlying issuer or its industry, including downgrades by the major rating agencies, are considered in evaluating impairment in value.  in addition to specific factors, other factors considered in our review of investment valuation are the length of time the fair value is below cost and the amount the fair value is below cost.
we individually analyze all positions with emphasis on those that have, in our opinion, declined significantly below cost.  in compliance with impairment guidance for debt securities, we perform further analysis to determine if a credit-related impairment has occurred.  some of the factors considered in determining whether a debt security is credit impaired include potential for the default of interest and/or principal, level of subordination, collateral of the issue, compliance with financial covenants, credit ratings and industry conditions.  we have the intent to sell all credit-impaired debt securities; therefore, the entire amount of the impairment charges are included in earnings and no impairments are recorded in other comprehensive income. we believe our investment valuation philosophy and accounting practices result in appropriate and timely measurement of value and recognition of impairment.
fixed maturities under our investment strategy, we maintain a fixed maturity portfolio that is of high quality and well diversified within each market sector.  this investment strategy also achieves a balanced maturity schedule.  our fixed maturity portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk.  our municipal bond portfolio currently accounts for $159.0 million, or 21%, of the total fixed maturity portfolio at december 31, 2018.  as part of a rebalancing of our portfolio, we began selling off our municipal bond portfolio and reinvesting the proceeds in short-term u.s. treasury securities in the fourth quarter of 2018.  we intend to liquidate the remaining municipal bond portfolio during the first half of 2019.
fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders' equity.  net unrealized losses on fixed maturities, net of deferred taxes, amounted to $7.0 million at december 31, 2018, compared to net unrealized gains of $3.3 million at december 31, 2017.

equity securities our equity securities consist of nonredeemable preferred stock and are carried at fair value in the statements of financial position with all changes in unrealized gains and losses reflected in the statements of operations, effective january 1, 2018 with the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-01. previously, changes in unrealized gains and losses were reflected in other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes.
the following table presents an analysis of the fair value of our preferred stock securities by industry sector at december 31:
(in thousands)

utilities                    0               1,093
total                  $11,853             $12,752
limited partnerships in 2018, investments in limited partnerships decreased from the investment levels at december 31, 2017.  changes in partnership values are a function of contributions and distributions, adjusted for market value changes in the underlying investments. the decrease in limited partnership investments was primarily due to net distributions received from the partnerships. we have made no new limited partnership commitments since 2006, and the balance of limited partnership investments is expected to decline over time as additional distributions are received. the results from our limited partnerships are based upon financial statements received from our general partners, which are generally received on a quarter lag. as a result, the market values and earnings recorded at december 31, 2018 reflect the partnership activity experienced during the twelve month period ending september 30, 2018.
shareholders' equity postretirement benefit plans the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the statements of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. at december 31, 2018, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans increased by $35.7 million, net of tax at the 21% corporate income tax rate that became effective january 1, 2018, of which $10.9 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $24.8 million represents the current period actuarial gain.  the 2018 actuarial gain was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption used to measure the future benefit obligations to 4.47% in 2018, from 3.73% in 2017. at december 31, 2017, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans decreased by $8.1 million, net of tax at the 21% corporate income tax rate that became effective january 1, 2018, of which $7.7 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $15.8 million represents the current period actuarial loss.  the 2017 actuarial loss was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption used to measure the future benefit obligations to 3.73% in 2017, from 4.24% in 2016, somewhat offset by the actual investment returns outperforming the assumed rate of return. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for approximately 59% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which includes pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and their allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions.
home office expansion in 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for a $100 million senior secured draw term loan credit facility ("credit facility") for the acquisition of real property and construction of an office building that will serve as part of our principal headquarters. as of december 31, 2018, we have drawn $100 million against the credit facility. during the draw period from december 1, 2016 through december 31, 2018, we made monthly interest payments under the credit facility. upon expiration of the draw period, the credit facility converted to a fully-amortized term loan with monthly payments of principal and interest over a period of 28 years, which commenced on january 1, 2019. borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.35%. in addition, we were required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.08% on the unused portion of the credit facility during the draw period. we capitalize applicable interest charges incurred during the construction period of long-term building projects as part of the historical cost of the asset.
34
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs.  our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management fee revenue and income from investments.  cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, and the purchase and development of information technology.  we expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations.
volatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we do occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash.  some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, are illiquid.  volatility in these markets could impair our ability to sell certain of our fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  additionally, our limited partnership investments are significantly less liquid.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from other sources even if market volatility persists throughout 2019.

net cash provided by operating activities was $263.6 million in 2018, compared to $197.1 million in 2017 and $254.3 million in 2016.  increased cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in management fee revenue received driven by growth in direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange along with a decrease in income taxes paid due to the lower corporate income tax rate effective january 1, 2018, compared to 2017. somewhat offsetting the increase in cash from operating activities was higher commissions and bonuses paid to agents and pension contributions, compared to 2017. cash paid for agent commissions and bonuses increased to $988.1 million in 2018, compared to $923.4 million in 2017, due to higher scheduled commissions driven by premium growth and higher bonus award payments resulting from profitable underwriting results. our board approved an $80 million accelerated pension contribution, which was paid in the first half of 2018. we contributed $58.9 million to our pension plan in 2017. we are reimbursed approximately 59% of the net periodic benefit cost of the pension plans from the exchange and its subsidiaries, which includes pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and their allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions. in 2017, decreased cash from operating activities was primarily due to higher commissions and bonuses paid to agents, pension contributions, and general operating expenses paid, compared to 2016. somewhat offsetting the decrease in cash provided in 2017 was an increase in management fee revenue received, reflecting the increase in direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange.
at december 31, 2018, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of $24.1 million, compared to $19.4 million at december 31, 2017. there was no deferred tax valuation allowance recorded at december 31, 2018.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $81.4 million in 2018, compared to $74.7 million in 2017 and $136.9 million in 2016. the increase in cash used in 2018, compared to 2017, was driven by increased agent loans and purchases of fixed assets primarily due to construction in progress related to the home office expansion. these increases were somewhat offset by more cash being generated from the sale, maturities and calls of available-for-sale securities and efl's repayment of the $25 million surplus note.  also impacting our future investing activities are limited partnership commitments, which totaled $12.2 million at december 31, 2018, and will be funded as required by the partnerships' agreements.  of this amount, the total remaining commitment to fund limited partnerships that invest in private equity securities was $4.4 million, mezzanine debt securities was $7.5 million, and real estate activities was $0.3 million. additionally, we have committed to incur future costs related to the construction of the building that will serve as part of our principal headquarters, which is expected to cost $100 million and is being funded by the senior secured draw term loan credit facility of the same amount. as of december 31, 2018, $66.1 million of costs have been incurred related to this project. the decrease in cash used in 2017, compared to 2016, was driven by more cash being generated from the sales, maturities and calls of available-for-sale securities.
35
net cash used in financing activities totaled $131.5 million in 2018, compared to $95.8 million in 2017 and $111.2 million in 2016.  the increase in cash used in 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to the lower scheduled draws on the senior secured draw term loan credit facility along with an increase in cash paid for dividends to shareholders. proceeds from scheduled draws were $25 million in 2018 compared to $50 million in 2017. future financing activities will include the principal payments due annually over the term of the senior secured draw term loan credit facility, of which $1.9 million will be paid in 2019. the decrease in cash used in 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to the higher scheduled draws on the senior secured draw term loan credit facility, somewhat offset by an increase in cash paid for dividends to shareholders.
no shares of our class a nonvoting common stock were repurchased in 2018, 2017 and 2016 in conjunction with our stock repurchase program. in 2011, our board of directors approved a continuation of the current stock repurchase program for a total of $150 million with no time limitation.  this repurchase authority includes, and is not in addition to, any unspent amounts remaining under the prior authorization.  we had approximately $17.8 million of repurchase authority remaining under this program at december 31, 2018, based upon trade date.
in 2018, 2017 and 2016, we purchased shares of our outstanding class a nonvoting common stock outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program for certain stock-based incentive plans. in 2018, we purchased 27,120 shares for $3.2 million for our equity compensation plan and to fund the rabbi trust for the outside director deferred stock compensation plan and the incentive compensation deferral plan. these shares were delivered in 2018. in 2017, we purchased 60,332 shares for $7.3 million for our long-term incentive plan, to fund the rabbi trust for the outside director deferred stock compensation plan, and for our equity compensation plan. these shares were delivered in 2017. in 2016, we purchased 15,093 shares for $1.5 million for our long-term incentive plan and to fund the rabbi trust for the outside director deferred stock compensation plan. these shares were delivered in 2016.
capital outlook we regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements for both normal and extreme risk events.  should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us.
outside of our normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through: 1) cash and cash equivalents, which total approximately $266.4 million at december 31, 2018, 2) a $100 million bank revolving line of credit, and 3) liquidation of unpledged assets held in our investment portfolio, including preferred stock and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately $386.1 million at december 31, 2018.  volatility in the financial markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  additionally, we have the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities.
as of december 31, 2018, we have access to a $100 million bank revolving line of credit with a $25 million letter of credit sublimit that expires on october 30, 2023. as of december 31, 2018, a total of $99.1 million remains available under the facility due to $0.9 million outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the availability for letters of credit to $24.1 million.  we had no borrowings outstanding on our line of credit as of december 31, 2018. bonds with a fair value of $108.7 million were pledged as collateral on the line at december 31, 2018. these securities have no trading restrictions and are reported as available-for-sale securities in the statements of financial position.  the bank requires compliance with certain covenants, which include leverage ratios and debt restrictions.  we were in compliance with our bank covenants at december 31, 2018.

(1)   long-term debt amount differs from the balance presented on the statements of financial position as the amount in the table above includes interest and principal payments based upon total draw commitments and excludes commitment fees.
(2)   on july 10, 2017, we agreed to the guaranteed maximum price terms of an agreement with our construction manager for the construction of the office building that will serve as part of our principal headquarters. substantial completion of the project is expected in the first half of 2020. the costs of this project are being funded by the senior secured draw term loan credit facility included in long-term debt in the table above.
(3)   limited partnership commitments will be funded as required for capital contributions at any time prior to the agreement expiration date. the commitment amounts are presented using the expiration date as the factor by which to age when the amounts are due. at december 31, 2018, our total commitment to fund limited partnerships that invest in private equity securities was $4.4 million, mezzanine debt was $7.5 million, and real estate activities was $0.3 million.
(4)   other commitments include various agreements for services, including information technology, support, and maintenance obligations, and other obligations in the ordinary course of business. these agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and the approximate timing of the transaction. the table above also includes agreements that contain cancellation provisions, some of which may require us to pay a termination fee. the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above as we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms.
(5)   operating leases - real estate are for third party and related party office space and a warehouse facility. commitments include minimum rental payments and related operating costs.
(6)   the obligation for our unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan (serp) for our executive and senior management is not included in gross contractual obligations. the recorded accumulated benefit obligation for this plan at december 31, 2018 is $18.9 million. we expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the future benefit payments as these become due. additionally, a $3.1 million uncertain tax position related to the timing of deductibility is not included in gross contractual obligations.
(7)   we are reimbursed from the exchange and its subsidiaries for a portion of the costs related to other commitments and operating leases.
our funding policy for our defined benefit pension plan is generally to contribute an amount equal or greater of the target normal cost for the plan year, or the amount necessary to fund the plan to 100%. historically, this has resulted in an annual pension contribution. in 2018, however, we made accelerated pension contributions totaling $80 million. following our 2018 contribution, we would not expect to make a subsequent contribution until the sum of the target normal costs for plan years beginning on and after december 31, 2017 exceeds $80 million, or earlier if a contribution is necessary to fund the plan to 100%.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements include those with unconsolidated entities that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations, including material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that conduct certain activities.  we have no material off-balance sheet obligations.
enterprise risk management the role of our enterprise risk management ("erm") function is to ensure that all significant risks are clearly identified, understood, proactively managed and consistently monitored to achieve strategic objectives for all stakeholders. our erm program views risk holistically across our entire group of companies. it ensures implementation of risk responses to mitigate potential impacts. see item 1a "risk factors" contained in this report for a list of risk factors.
37
our erm process is founded on a governance framework that includes oversight at multiple levels of our organization, including our board of directors and executive management. accountability to identify, manage, and mitigate risk is embedded within all functions and areas of our business. we have defined risk tolerances to monitor and manage significant risks within acceptable levels. in addition to identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, monitoring, and mitigating significant risks, our erm process includes extreme event analyses and scenario testing. given our defined tolerance for risk, risk model output is used to quantify the potential variability of future performance and the sufficiency of capital and liquidity levels.
transactions/agreements with related parties board oversight our board of directors has a broad oversight responsibility over our intercompany relationships with the exchange.  as a consequence, our board of directors may be required to make decisions or take actions that may not be solely in the interest of our shareholders, such as setting the management fee rate paid by the exchange to us and ratifying any other significant intercompany activity.
insurance holding company system most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer. the exchange has the following wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries: erie insurance company, erie insurance company of new york, erie insurance property and casualty company and flagship city insurance company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, erie family life insurance company. indemnity and the exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system.
all transactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable.  approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the members within a holding company system.
intercompany agreements subscriber's and services agreements we serve as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange, a reciprocal insurance exchange.  each applicant for insurance to a reciprocal insurance exchange signs a subscriber's agreement that contains an appointment of an attorney-in-fact.  through the designation of attorney-in-fact, we are required to provide policy issuance and renewal services and act as the attorney-in-fact for the exchange with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously.  pursuant to the subscriber's agreement, we earn a management fee for these services calculated as a percentage of the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. by virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the attorney-in-fact. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for all administrative services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. the amounts incurred for all administrative services are reimbursed to indemnity at cost in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements. these reimbursements are settled on a monthly basis. state insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.
leased property we lease certain property from the exchange including the home office and certain field office space. for the home office, rent is based on rental rates of like property in erie, pennsylvania and all operating expenses including utilities, cleaning, repairs, real estate taxes, property insurance and leasehold improvements are the responsibility of the tenant (indemnity). rental costs of shared facilities are allocated based upon usage or square footage occupied. we also had a lease commitment with efl for a field office until december 31, 2018.
we previously owned three field offices for which rental costs of shared facilities were allocated based upon usage or square footage occupied. on december 31, 2018, we sold the three field offices to the exchange at the current independent appraised value in order to align the ownership interest of these facilities with the functions being performed at these locations, which are claims-related activities.
cost allocation the allocation of costs affects our financial condition and that of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries. management's role is to determine that allocations are consistently made in accordance with the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the exchange, intercompany service agreements, and applicable insurance laws and regulations.  allocation of
38
costs under these various agreements requires judgment and interpretation, and such allocations are performed using a consistent methodology, which is intended to adhere to the terms and intentions of the underlying agreements.

we have significant receivables from the exchange and its subsidiaries that result in a concentration of credit risk.  these receivables include management fees due for policy issuance and renewal services performed by us under the subscriber's agreement, and certain costs we incur acting as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the exchange as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously. we continually monitor the financial strength of the exchange. these receivables from the exchange and its subsidiaries are settled monthly.
surplus note we previously held a $25 million surplus note that was issued to us by efl in 2003 and was payable on demand on or after december 31, 2018. on december 14, 2018, efl, with the appropriate approval from the pennsylvania insurance commissioner, satisfied its obligation and repaid the surplus note. the note bore an annual interest rate of 6.7% and efl paid interest to us of $1.6 million in 2018, and $1.7 million in both 2017 and 2016.

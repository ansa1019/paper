item 1a.  risk factors the company's business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those expected or desired.
security problems could damage our reputation and business. we rely on industry-standard encryption, network and internet security systems, most of which we license from third parties, to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data and to prevent unauthorized access to our computer networks, systems, and data. our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet. computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks. other potential attacks include attempts to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses, ransomware or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. to date, none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations. such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. an interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. individual personal computers can be stolen, and customer data media can be lost in shipment. under state, federal, and foreign laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches, the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial. advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate. security risks may result in liability to our customers or other third parties, damage to our reputation, and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products. we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches, and, in the event of a breach, we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by such breach. addressing security problems may result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service to users, any of which could harm our business.
operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims, increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers. damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers, damage our reputation, expose us to damage claims, and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment. our back-up systems and procedures may not prevent disruption, such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services. in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours, we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption. any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue, have a negative impact on our reputation, result in damage claims, lead our present
13
and potential customers to choose other service providers, and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions, with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs.
failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss. the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow. we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. transactions facilitated by us include debit card, credit card, electronic bill payment transactions, automated clearing house ("ach") payments and check clearing that support consumers, financial institutions and other businesses. if the continuity of operations, integrity of processing, or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions, this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us. in addition, we rely on various third parties to process transactions and provide services in support of the processing of transactions and funds settlement for certain of our products and services. if we are unable to obtain such services in the future, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. in addition, we may issue credit to consumers, financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement. a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us.
failures of third party service providers we rely upon could lead to financial loss. jha relies on third party service providers to support key portions of its operations. jha also relies on third party service providers to provide part or all of certain services it delivers to customers. while we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. a failure of these services by a third party could have a material impact upon jha's delivery of its services to customers. such a failure could lead to damages claims, loss of customers, and reputational harm, depending on the duration and severity of the failure. third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf. these third-party vendors are subject to similar risks as us relating to cybersecurity, breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees. one or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, it may not be adequately addressed, either operationally or financially, by the third party vendor. certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations. if a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business, increase costs, or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations. the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. as a supplier of services to financial institutions, portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency, the federal reserve board, the federal deposit insurance corporation, and the national credit union association, among other regulatory agencies. these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate, and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations.
in addition, existing laws, regulations, and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion. the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, signed into law in 2010, significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry, producing new regulatory agencies and voluminous new regulations, some of which are still being written. the bureau of consumer financial protection ("cfpb") was established, which is implementing numerous new regulations applicable to "supervised service providers" such as the company. these new regulations may require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel. our customers are also regulated entities, and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions. concerns are growing with respect to the use, confidentiality, and security of private customer information. regulatory agencies, congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined. this includes rules enacted by the new york department of financial services that require covered financial institutions to have a cyber security program along with other compliance requirements. the unique data protection regulations issued by multiple agencies has created a fragmented series of requirements that makes it increasingly complex to comply with all of the mandates in an efficient manner.
the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation. we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations. in particular, numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010. substantial software research and development and other corporate
14
resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving, complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment. our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers, for which we may bear ultimate liability.
our business may be adversely impacted by u.s. and global market and economic conditions. we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry. if the economic environment worsens, we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees, which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending. deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and the company's related revenues.
changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products. cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions. because our business is concentrated in financial institutions, unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions, including spending on computer software and hardware. such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgrade/complementary product sales to existing customers. the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure.
competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income. we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines. we compete on the basis of product quality, reliability, performance, ease of use, quality of support and services, integration with other products and pricing. some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size, product lines, greater marketing resources, or exclusive intellectual property rights. new competitors regularly appear with new products, services and technology for financial institutions. if competitors offer more favorable pricing, payment or other contractual terms, warranties, or functionality, or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services, we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete.
our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations. while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions, as a provider of processing services to such institutions, we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities. if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation. such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers.
a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us. effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud. if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.
failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business. our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five or more years. we will continue to experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal each year. renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us. if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms, our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer.
the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business. we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees. our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals. if we lose one or more of our key employees, we could suffer a loss of managerial experience, and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers.
our failure to comply with the rules of the payment card networks could adversely affect our business. we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa, mastercard and similar organizations, including the payment card data security standards. if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined or our certifications
15
could be suspended or terminated, which could limit our ability to service our customers and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations.
if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve, we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business. the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes. these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services. our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services. if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned, or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services, we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues, as well as lose prospective sales.
our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions. we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses, products and services. this strategy depends on our ability to identify, negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions. merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions. if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth.
if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes. we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others. infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services. such claims, whether with or without merit, are time-consuming, may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us. if our defense of such claims is not successful, we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications.
unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense. the u.s. recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law could have an adverse impact to us. unfavorable future tax law changes could also result in these negative impacts. although we cannot predict whether or in what form such legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. our primary market consists of approximately 5,630 commercial and savings banks and more than 5,680 credit unions. the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures and mergers and acquisitions and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs.
acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate. we have acquired a number of businesses in the past, including the acquisition of ensenta corporation in december 2017, and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future. we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies. we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including: financial control and computer system compatibility; unanticipated costs; unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services; differing regulatory and industry standards; diversion of management's attention; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; loss of key employees; and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets. to finance future acquisitions, we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public. if we fail to integrate our acquisitions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets.
expansion of services to non-traditional customers could expose us to new risks. we have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional, regulated, and litigation-averse base of financial institution customers. these non-regulated customers may entail greater operational, credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs.
the impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations. our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent a significant portion of our total assets at june 30, 2018. on an annual basis, and whenever circumstances require, we review our intangible assets for impairment. if the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired, it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. an impairment of a significant portion of these intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following section provides management's view of the company's financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data, the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes included elsewhere in this report. all dollar and share amounts, except per share amounts, are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017 and compare fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016.

20
satisfaction and retention. we consistently measure customer satisfaction using comprehensive annual surveys and randomly generated daily surveys we receive in our everyday business. dedicated surveys are also used to grade specific aspects of our customer experience, including product implementation, education, and consulting services.
during the last five fiscal years, our revenues have grown from $1,173,173 in fiscal 2014 to $1,536,603 in fiscal 2018. net income has grown from $186,715 in fiscal 2014 to $376,660 in fiscal 2018. the revenue growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion. net income in fiscal 2018 included a net tax benefit of $118,367 recorded as result of the tcja.
our two primary revenue streams are "services and support" and "processing". services and support includes: "outsourcing and cloud" fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or longer at inception; "product delivery and services" revenue, which includes revenue from the sales of licenses, implementation services, consulting, and hardware; and "in-house support" revenue, which is composed of maintenance fees which primarily contain annual contract terms. processing revenue includes: "remittance" revenue from payment processing, remote capture, and automated clearing house (ach) transactions; "card" fees, including card transaction processing and monthly fees; and "transaction and digital" revenue, which includes transaction and mobile processing fees. we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins.
we have four reportable segments: core, payments, complementary, and corporate and other. the respective segments include all related revenues along with the related cost of sales.
we continue to focus on our objective of providing the best integrated solutions, products and customer service to our clients. we are cautiously optimistic regarding ongoing economic improvement and expect our clients to continue investing in our products and services to improve their operating efficiencies and performance. we anticipate that consolidation within the financial services industry will continue. regulatory conditions and legislation will continue to impact financial institutions' discretionary spending.
a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows.
results of operations fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
in fiscal 2018, revenues increased 7% or $105,486 compared to fiscal 2017. deconversion fees increased $6,021 compared to the prior fiscal year, and we had revenue from fiscal 2018 acquisitions totaling $17,145. excluding these factors, and excluding $9,341 of revenue from the fiscal 2017 year-to-date period related to divestitures, total revenue still increased 7%, with strong growth in each of our revenue streams as discussed in detail below.
operating expenses increased 8% year over year. excluding costs related to deconversion fees from each year, expenses related to fiscal 2018 acquisitions, fiscal 2017 costs related to divestitures, and gains on the disposals of businesses from each year, operating expenses increased 7%.
the tcja had a large impact on our provision for income taxes and net income, which are discussed below.
we move into fiscal 2019 following a strong performance in fiscal 2018. significant portions of our business continue to provide recurring revenue and our healthy sales pipeline is also encouraging. our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address, and in these times, they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability, efficiency, and security. our strong balance sheet, access to extensive lines of credit, the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities.
a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 follows.

we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software, service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings. we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customer-driven.
research and development expenses increased primarily due to increased salary and benefit expenses, in part due to a 4% increase in headcount, but were consistent with the prior year as a percentage of total revenue.

effective rate                     3.7    %               33.0    %
the significant decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of the tcja enacted december 22, 2017, which included a reduction to the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to 21% effective january 1, 2018. a blended 28% u.s federal statutory income tax rate was applied to fiscal 2018. we recorded a net tax benefit of $94,549 related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities and $23,818 related to the impacts on current year operations.
net income net income increased 53% to $376,660, or $4.85 per diluted share, in fiscal 2018 from $245,793, or $3.14 per diluted share, in fiscal 2017. the significant increase is primarily attributable to the tcja. excluding the $118,367 of tax benefit recorded as a result of the tcja, net income increased 5% and diluted earnings per share increased 6% for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
in fiscal 2017, revenues increased 6% or $76,471 compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to strong growth in services and support revenue, as discussed below.
operating expenses increased 7%, partially due to the gain on the sale of our alogent business ("alogent") in fiscal 2016, which is discussed below in the operating expenses section.
provision for income taxes increased 9% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due a lower effective tax rate in the earlier year, which is described in the following discussion.

reportable segment discussion the company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations.
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, jha changed its reportable segment structure from two customer-centric segments, bank and credit union, to four product-centric segments. the change was made based on the view of our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker, that the company could be more effectively managed using a product-centric approach and was driven by the first budgetary process under his administration.
the company's operations are classified into four reportable segments: core, payments, complementary, and corporate and other. the core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions, which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and maintain centralized customer/member information. the payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including atm, debit, and credit card processing services, online and mobile bill pay solutions, and risk management products and services. the complementary segment provides additional software and services that can be integrated with our core solutions or used independently. the corporate & other segment includes hardware revenue and costs, as well as operating costs not directly attributable to the other three segments.
the prior periods presented have been retroactively recast to conform to the new segment structure adopted july 1, 2017.

in fiscal 2018, revenue in the core segment increased 10% compared to fiscal 2017, driven primarily by increases in both product delivery and services revenue and outsourcing and cloud revenue. the increase in product delivery and services revenue was mainly due to increased revenue being recognized as a result of the completion of revised contractual obligations on several long-term contracts that permitted the company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements. cost of revenue for the core segment increased 10% for the year-to-date period.
in fiscal 2017, revenue in the core segment increased 12%, due to increased support and service revenue driven by increases in our product delivery and services stream and our outsourcing and cloud stream. the increased product delivery and services revenue was partly due to increased revenue being recognized as a result of the completion of

revised contractual obligations on several long-term contracts that permitted the company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements. cost of revenue increased 8% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.

in fiscal 2018, revenue in the payments segment increased 7% compared to fiscal 2017. cost of revenue increased 9% for the fiscal year-to-date period, partially due to increased headcount and amortization expenses related to ensenta, as well as increased spending related to our strategic partnership with first data and pscu to expand our credit and debit card platform. excluding deconversion fees from each period and ensenta revenue from fiscal 2018, along with related costs, revenue increased 5% and costs of revenue also increased 5%.
in fiscal 2017, revenue in the payments segment increased due primarily to increased card and remittance processing revenue compared to fiscal 2016. cost of revenue increased 4%.

revenue in the complementary segment increased 7% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. the increase was driven by increased outsourcing and cloud services, as well as increased transaction and digital processing. excluding deconversion fees from each period and vanguard software group revenue from fiscal 2018, revenue increased 6%. cost of revenue increased 6%, but was a consistent percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.
in fiscal 2017, revenue in the complementary segment increased 10%. the increase was primarily in our support and service revenue, and was driven by increases in our product delivery and services stream and our outsourcing and cloud stream. the increased product delivery and services revenue was due in part to increased revenue being recognized as a result of the completion of revised contractual obligations on several long-term contracts that permitted the company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements. cost of revenue increased 7% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.

revenue in the corporate and other segment for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 decreased mainly due to a loss of revenue from our jhadirect product line, which was disposed near the beginning of fiscal 2018. for fiscal 2017, revenue from jhadirect totaled $6,536. revenue classified in the corporate and other segment includes revenue from hardware and other products not specifically attributed to any of the other three segments.
the decreased revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 in the corporate and other segment is largely due to alogent revenue of $28,422 included in fiscal 2016.
cost of revenue for the corporate and other segment includes operating costs not directly attributable to any of the other three segments.
liquidity and capital resources the company's cash and cash equivalents decreased to $31,440 at june 30, 2018 from $114,765 at june 30, 2017. the decrease is primarily due to our acquisitions of vanguard software group and ensenta, the latter of which was partially funded by borrowing on our revolving credit facility, which has now been re-paid.

net cash provided by operating activities      $412,142              $357,322
cash provided by operating activities increased 15% compared to fiscal 2017. cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase stock, and for capital expenditures.
cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 totaled $291,826 and included: $137,562, net of cash acquired, for the purchases of ensenta corporation and vanguard software group; $96,647 for the ongoing enhancements and development of existing and new product and service offerings; capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of $40,135, mainly for the purchase of computer equipment; $13,138 for the purchase and development of internal use software; and $5,000 for the purchase of preferred stock of automated bookkeeping, inc. this was partially offset by $350 of proceeds from the sale of businesses, and $306 of proceeds from asset sales.
cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 totaled $141,586 and included: $89,631 for the development of software; capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of $41,947, mainly for the purchase of computer equipment; and $16,608 for the purchase and development of internal use software. these expenditures were partially offset by $5,632 of proceeds from the sale of businesses and $968 of proceeds from the sale of assets.
financing activities used cash of $203,641 for fiscal 2018. cash used was $175,000 for repayment on our revolving credit facility, dividends paid to stockholders of $105,021, and $48,986 for the purchase of treasury shares. these uses were partially offset by borrowings of $125,000 on our revolving credit facility and $366 of net cash inflow from the issuance of stock and tax related to stock-based compensation.
financing activities used cash in fiscal 2017 of $171,281. cash used was $130,140 for the purchase of treasury shares, dividends paid to stockholders of $91,707, and repayments of the revolving credit facility and capital leases totaling $30,200. this was partially offset by borrowings of $80,000 and $766 of net cash inflow from the issuance of stock and tax related to stock-based compensation.
at june 30, 2018, the company had negative working capital of $19,360, however, the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of $355,538, which primarily relates to our annual in-house maintenance agreements and deferred bundled product and service arrangements. the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance. in addition, we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts and we have access to remaining lines of credit in excess of $300,000. we continue to generate substantial cash inflows from operations. therefore, we do not anticipate any liquidity problems arising from this condition.
capital requirements and resources the company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements. capital expenditures totaling $40,135 and $41,947 for the twelve months ending june 30, 2018 and june 30, 2017, respectively, were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities. these additions were funded from cash generated by operations. at june 30, 2018, the company had $2,076 of material outstanding purchase commitments related to property and equipment.
the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock. under this authorization, the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or short-term borrowings on its existing credit facilities. the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time. at june 30, 2018, there were 26,108 shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 3,883 additional shares. the total cost of treasury shares at june 30, 2018 is $1,055,260. during fiscal 2018, the company repurchased 448 treasury shares for $48,986. at june 30, 2017, there were 25,660 shares in treasury stock and the company had authority to repurchase up to 4,330 additional shares.
revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility allows for borrowings of up to $300,000, which may be increased by the company at any time until maturity to $600,000. the credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to (a) a rate based on libor
27
or (b) an alternate base rate (the highest of (i) the prime rate for such day, (ii) the sum of the federal funds effective rate for such day plus 0.50% and (iii) the eurocurrency rate for a one-month interest period on such day for dollars plus 1.0%), plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the company's leverage ratio. the credit facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the company. the credit facility is subject to various financial covenants that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement. as of june 30, 2018, the company was in compliance with all such covenants. the revolving loan terminates february 20, 2020 and at june 30, 2018 there was no outstanding balance.
other lines of credit the company renewed an unsecured bank credit line on april 24, 2017 which provides for funding of up to $5,000 and bears interest at the prime rate less 1%. the credit line was renewed through april 30, 2019. at june 30, 2018, no amount was outstanding.
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations at june 30, 2018, the company's total off balance sheet contractual obligations were $656,507. this balance consists of $63,370 of long-term operating leases for various facilities and equipment which expire from 2019 to 2030 and $593,137 of purchase commitments. jha entered a strategic services agreement with first data® and pscu® to provide full-service debit and credit card processing on a single platform to all existing core bank and credit union customers, as well as expand its card processing platform to financial institutions outside our core customer base. this agreement includes a purchase commitment of $559,354 over the term of the contract. the remainder of the purchase commitments relate mainly to open purchase orders. the contractual obligations table below excludes $11,507 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement.

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014. this standard is part of an effort to create a common revenue standard for u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") and international financial reporting standards ("ifrs"). the new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition. the new model enacts a five-step process for achieving the core principle, which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. in august 2015, the fasb also issued asu no. 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year, but allows early application as of the original effective date. we did not adopt the provisions of the new standard early, so the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning july 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. in march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-08, which addresses principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue standard. additional updates, including asu no. 2016-10, asu no. 2016-12, and asu no. 2016-20, also address specific aspects of the new standard and are being considered. entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods (full retrospective) or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption (modified retrospective). we plan to adopt the new standard using the full retrospective method.
the company has taken the following steps in evaluating and planning for the implementation of the new standard:
•   organization of a cross-functional implementation team whose goals are to: assess the impact of the guidance on each of our revenue streams by applying the five step model; determine new processes and procedures necessary to ensure proper revenue and cost recognition; quantify the effects of the new standard on prior and current year revenue; determine opening balances for deferred revenues and costs, including tax effects, as of the beginning of fiscal 2017; develop disclosures required upon the adoption of the new standard; and develop new internal controls to ensure compliance with the new standard.
28
•   continued implementation and testing of new revenue recognition software that will apply the five-step model to each of our customer contracts.
•   continued comparisons of revenue recognition under current accounting methods versus under asc topic 606 for each of our revenue streams.
determinations that have been made regarding the effect of the new standard are as follows:
•   we expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our revenue recognition currently subject to asc topic 985. one of the most significant expected impacts relates to the recognition of license and implementation revenue on our multi-element arrangements. under the current standard, license and implementation revenue on these arrangements is often recognized over the maintenance period of the software due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ("vsoe") for these elements. under asc topic 606, revenue for license and implementation will no longer be deferred due solely to a lack of vsoe. generally, each license and its implementation will be recognized as one performance obligation at the time the implementation is completed.
•   this new model will require more use of judgments and estimates than the current standard, including identifying performance obligations, estimating variable consideration, allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation based on stand-alone selling price, and allocating commissions to the proper performance obligations so that costs are correctly recognized in line with revenue. we will be required to estimate the total expected value of variable consideration arising from items such as maintenance and transaction or item processing at contract inception and include those estimates in the total transaction price of the contract to be allocated to each performance obligation. these estimates will be modified over the term of the contract, resulting in re-allocations of the transaction price and adjustments to revenue recognized on the contract.
significant implementation matters still being addressed include:
•   determination of opening balances for deferred revenues and costs, and the quantitative effect of the new standard on prior and current year revenues and costs. our analysis of the quantitative effects of the new standard on fiscal years 2017 and 2018 will continue at least through early september 2018.
•   development of required disclosures under the new standard.
•   updates to our internal controls surrounding the new system and processes.

the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases, in february 2016. this asu aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information regarding leasing arrangements. specifically, the standard requires operating lease commitments to be recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and the cost of those operating leases to be amortized on a straight-line basis. asu no. 2016-02 will be effective for jha's annual reporting period beginning july 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. at transition, a modified retrospective approach must be utilized to measure leases as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, however, the fasb has provided certain practical expedients, which the company is currently evaluating. the company is currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and when we will adopt it.
the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, in march 2016. the new standard is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting and presentation of share-based payment transactions, including reporting of excess tax benefits and shortfalls, statutory minimum withholding considerations, and classification within the statement of cash flows. the standard allows a one-time accounting policy election to either account for forfeitures as they occur or continue to estimate them. asu no. 2016-09 was effective for the company's annual reporting period beginning july 1, 2017. management elected to early adopt this standard as of july 1, 2016 and has elected to continue our current practice of estimating forfeitures. the adoption of this standard had the following impacts on our consolidated financial statements.
•   consolidated statements of income- the new standard requires that the tax effects of share-based compensation be recognized in the provision for income taxes. previously, these amounts were recognized in additional paid-in capital. for fiscal 2018, net tax benefits related to share- based compensation awards of $3,274 were recognized as reductions of income tax expense, reducing our income tax rate by 0.84%, and increasing our basic and diluted earnings per share each by $0.04. for fiscal 2017, net tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards of $2,638 were recognized as reductions of income tax expense. these tax benefits reduced our effective income tax rate by 0.72%, and caused an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.03 for fiscal 2017. in addition, in calculating potential common
29
shares used to determine diluted earnings per share, u.s. gaap require us to use the treasury stock method. the new standard requires that assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method be modified to exclude the amount of excess tax benefits that would have been recognized in additional paid-in capital. these changes were applied on a prospective basis.
•   consolidated statements of cash flows- the company elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively. the recast for fiscal 2016 resulted in an increase to both net cash provided by operations and net cash used in financing of $1,306. the presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented on our consolidated cash flows statements since such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity.
asu 2016-15 issued by the fasb in august 2016 clarifies cash flow classification of eight specific cash flow issues and is effective for our annual reporting period beginning july 1, 2018. we did not adopt the provisions of the new standard early. we do not expect any significant impact to our financial statements as a result of this standard.
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap. the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.
we have identified several critical accounting estimates. an accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue net of any applicable discounts in accordance with u.s. gaap and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the sec. the application of these pronouncements requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements, and whether "vsoe" of fair value exists for those elements. customers receive certain elements of our products and services over time. changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and deferred revenue reflected in the financial statements.
license arrangements: for software license agreements, the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product or service has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. for arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until payments become due. the company's software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or "elements." generally, none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements.
for multiple element arrangements, which contain software elements and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a group and the non-software deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement. for our non-software deliverables, we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price ("esp"). for our software elements, we use vsoe for this allocation when it can be established and esp when vsoe cannot be established.
the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vsoe if available, third-party evidence ("tpe") if vsoe is not available, or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. generally, we are not able to determine tpe because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. esp is determined after considering both market conditions (such as the sale of similar products in the market place) and entity-specific factors (such as pricing practices and the specifics of each transaction).
for our non-software deliverables, a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has standalone value and if the customer has a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially within our control.
30
for our software licenses and related services, including the software elements of multiple-element software and non-software arrangements, u.s. gaap generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value. vsoe of fair value is determined for implementation services based on a rate per hour for stand-alone professional services and the estimated hours for the bundled implementation, if the hours can be reasonably estimated. vsoe of fair value is determined for post-contract support ("pcs") based upon the price charged when sold separately. for a majority of the elements within our software arrangements, we have determined that vsoe cannot be established; therefore, revenue on our software arrangements is generally deferred until the only remaining element is pcs. at that point, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period, assuming that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. the amounts deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as bundled products & services revenue within support & service revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
for arrangements that include specified upgrades, such upgrades are accounted for as a separate element of the arrangement. for those specified upgrades for which vsoe of fair value cannot be determined, revenue related to the software elements within the arrangement is deferred until such specified upgrades have been delivered.
support and service fee revenue (non-software): maintenance support revenue contracted for outside of a license arrangement is recognized pro-rata over the contract period, typically one year.
outsourced data processing and atm, debit card, and other transaction processing services revenue is recognized in the month the transactions are processed or the services are rendered.
hardware revenue: hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer, when title and risk of loss are transferred. the revenue related to these hardware sales is recorded gross, as we are the primary obligor in the contract with the customer. the company also re-markets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers. gross hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period.
revenue-based taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis (i.e., excluded from revenues).
deferred costs costs for certain software and hardware maintenance contracts with third parties, which are prepaid, are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract, generally one to five years, with the related revenue amortized from deferred revenues.
direct and incremental fulfillment costs associated with arrangements subject to asc 985-605 (for which vsoe of fair value cannot be established) are deferred until the only remaining element in the revenue arrangement is pcs at which point the costs are recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period with the related revenue. deferred direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements not subject to asc 985-605 consist primarily of certain up-front costs incurred in connection with our software hosting arrangements and are recognized ratably over the contract period which typically ranges from 5-7 years. these costs include commissions, costs of third-party licenses and the direct costs of our implementation services, consisting of payroll and other fringe benefits.
depreciation and amortization expense the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists. we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term, but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company's future consolidated operating results. we consider whether there is potential for impairment of any long-lived assets, and perform testing for valuation if it is determined that there is a triggering event causing risk of impairment.
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products. for software that is to be sold, significant estimates and assumptions include: establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized, determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete.
31
for internal use software, capitalization begins at the beginning of application development. costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred. significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life.
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations.
estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly. considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. also, liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our financial results.
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment. liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition, and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value. third-party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecast revenues or profits on contract-related intangibles. numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by company professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired.
as goodwill is not amortized, goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment. such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values. cash flow projections are based on management-approved estimates, which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance, operations and program management. key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. the company's most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value. however, significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

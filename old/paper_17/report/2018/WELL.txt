item 1a. risk factors this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. if any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed in this section or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline. we group these risk factors into three categories:
•   risks arising from our business;
•   risks arising from our capital structure; and
•   risks arising from our status as a reit.
risks arising from our business our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. if we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project. such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations. investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. furthermore, there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject to various conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing, on anticipated terms, or at all. health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. we also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. as a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate.
our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments, our partners' insolvency or failure to meet their obligations, and disputes between us and our partners we have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities. joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture; and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests. in addition, our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted. in some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. our ability to acquire our partner's interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. in such event, we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. joint ventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures. even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property.
we are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. these risks include fluctuations in occupancy, medicare and medicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions; competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage; state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; and the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise). any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations.
decreases in our operators' revenues or increases in our operators' expenses could affect our operators' ability to make payments to us our operators' revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and medicare and medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. operating costs continue to increase for our operators. to the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. to the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset. furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results.  all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate.
increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators' ability to meet their obligations to us the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients, including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price, and location. our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses.  in addition, we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities. we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us.  if our operators cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities, their financial performance and ability to meet their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
a severe cold and flu season, epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triple-net properties our revenues and our operators' revenues are dependent on occupancy. it is impossible to predict the severity of the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses. the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triple-net properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness.  such a decrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triple-net operators to make payments to us. in addition, a flu pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators, including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents, and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
the insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition we are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us, which may result in a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons. although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. in addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law. we may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. in some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. in some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor. if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate.
we may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us from time to time, we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities, principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties, including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements. in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns, we expect to re-invest these proceeds in a timely manner. we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors, including other health care reits, real estate partnerships, health care providers, health care lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us.
the properties managed by sunrise senior living, llc ("sunrise") account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us as of december 31, 2018, sunrise managed 161 of our seniors housing operating properties.  these properties account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we rely on sunrise to manage these properties efficiently and effectively. we also rely on sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations.  any adverse developments in sunrise's business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. also, if sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could result in, among other things, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the u.s. bankruptcy code, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we depend on genesis healthcare ("genesis"), brookdale senior living ("brookdale") and promedica health system ("promedica") for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure, inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us the properties we lease to genesis, brookdale and promedica account for a significant portion of our revenues, and because these leases are triple-net leases, we also depend on genesis, brookdale and promedica to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. we cannot assure you that genesis, brookdale and promedica will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by genesis, brookdale or promedica to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. genesis, brookdale and promedica have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that genesis, brookdale and promedica will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations.  genesis, brookdale and promedica's failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, we have made real estate and other loans to genesis and their operational or other failures could adversely impact their ability to repay these loans when due.
ownership of property outside the u.s. may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations we have operations in canada and the u.k. which represent 10.0% and 9.6% of total welltower revenues, respectively. as of december 31, 2018, revera managed 98 of our seniors housing operating properties in canada, representing a significant portion of our revenues, and also owned a controlling interest in sunrise. international development, ownership, and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. these risks include, but are not limited to, any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit; challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions (regionally, nationally and locally) including, but not limited to, continuing uncertainty surrounding the process of brexit and the macroeconomic and regulatory effects of brexit, including impacts on the u.k. real estate market; challenges in managing international operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and political and economic instability; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the u.s. that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
if our tenants do not renew their existing leases, or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons, we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms, or at all we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times. if these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them. there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all.
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses. our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator, economic and other conditions will be limited. no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell. our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us.  all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate.
our tenants, operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses we maintain or require our tenants, operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly-situated companies in our industry, and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. that said, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators or managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages or that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease, management and other agreements, which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss. also, in recent years, long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims. as a result, general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets. general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the tenants', operators' and managers' future operations, cash flows and financial condition, and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants', operators' and managers' ability to meet their obligations to us.
our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. as the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.
the requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as medicare, medicaid or government funding, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors' ability to meet their obligations to us some of our obligors' businesses are affected by government reimbursement. to the extent that an operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors, primarily medicare and medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities), any lapse in congressional funding of the centers for medicare and medicaid services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property. in recent years, government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures. health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator, whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare, medicaid or private payors. significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us.
the health reform laws, provide those states that expand their medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective january 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as of early february 2018, more than 60% of the states have expanded medicaid coverage. the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants' revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants. we expect that the current presidential administration and u.s. congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the health reform laws, including medicaid expansion. since taking office, president trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the health reform laws.  see "item 1 - business - certain government regulations - united states - reimbursement" above for additional information. if the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the health reform laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. more generally, and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the u.s. economy, our business, or that of our operators and tenants.
our operators' or tenants' failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely affect such operators' or tenants' operations, which could adversely affect our operators' and tenants' ability to meet their obligations to us our operators and tenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards. our operators' or tenants' failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. such actions may have an effect on our operators' or tenants' ability to make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. see "item 1 - business - certain government regulations - united states - fraud & abuse enforcement" above.
many of our properties may require a license, registration, and/or con to operate. failure to obtain a license, registration, or con, or loss of a required license, registration, or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. these events could materially adversely affect our operators' or tenants' ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us. state and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency. see "item 1 - business - certain government regulations - united states - licensing and certification" above.
the real estate market and our business may be negatively impacted by changes to u.s. tax laws the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act") enacted in december 2017 significantly changes the u.s. income tax rules for individuals and corporations. although the tax act involves comprehensive changes to the system of corporate income tax, it does not substantively change the manner in which reits are taxed. although numerous provisions of the tax act do affect reits, we are generally not subject to federal taxes applicable to regular corporations if we comply with the tax law governing reit status and distribute annually an amount at least equal to our taxable income. nonetheless, the tax act makes numerous changes to the individual income tax rules that may affect the real estate market in the u.s., including limitations on the deductibility of state and local property taxes and interest. although the impact of these changes is likely to be most significant in the residential real estate market, rather than in the sectors where we operate, the effects of these changes on the broader real estate market in the geographic areas in which we operate and on our tenants remain uncertain.
changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results we are subject to taxation in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  because, even with the passage of the tax act, the u.s. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and u.s. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. longstanding international norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us, thereby, increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries; it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest. given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.
unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition from time to time, we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. in addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations.
development, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability at any given time, we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use. the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements and/or third party payor contracts. in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts.
in connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. in addition, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may not be able to complete construction and lease-up of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs. additionally, the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns. because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions. newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall financial performance.
in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. in particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy, rental rates and capital costs. if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors, the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. additionally, we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property.
we may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters, which could result in an increase of our or our tenants' cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. however, a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods. we believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants' insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses. these losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants' cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property.  in addition, we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds, in our or our tenants' judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss.
we may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors' business or financial condition under various laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the person's relationship to the property. our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property. moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. those assessments are designed to meet the "all appropriate inquiry" standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination. however, environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors.
cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronic security breaches, including those resulting from human error, product defects and technology failures. such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. while we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. in the past, we have experienced cybersecurity breaches, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary, personal identifying or confidential information of our employees, operators, tenants and partners could result in legal claims or proceedings, including under data privacy regulations.
our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed our success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our executive officers and other highly qualified employees, and competition for their talents is intense. we cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. losing any key personnel could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
risks arising from our capital structure our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors. provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.
we may become more leveraged permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, or (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies.
cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the board of directors if cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise, we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with delaware law and depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt and equity capital available to us, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements, maintenance of our reit qualification, restrictions under delaware law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. additionally, our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein, or other significant adverse events, occur.
we are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions; the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of our capital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; the financial stability of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us; changes in the credit ratings on u.s. government debt securities; or default or delay in payment by the u.s. of its obligations. if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders.
downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.
increases in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our cost of capital an increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt.  such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations, the acquisition and development of properties, and refinance existing debt. additionally, increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets, limiting our ability to sell existing assets.
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position, including exchange rate fluctuations resulting from brexit. we generate a portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling. although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
our entry into hedge agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates we enter into hedge agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility. these agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. in addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. when we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a risk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge. if such events occur, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
risks arising from our status as a reit we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner. if we lose our status as a reit, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because:
•   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to u.s. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;
•   we could be subject to possibly increased state and local taxes; and
•   unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.
since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of u.s. federal and other income taxes owed. a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. if we do not qualify as a reit, we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-reit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax. in addition, if we fail to qualify as a reit, all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 20%) with respect to distributions.
as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit. although we believe that we qualify as a reit, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes.
certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit we own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as reits for u.s. federal income tax purposes, some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate reit for federal income tax purposes (each a "subsidiary reit"). to qualify as a reit, each subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements under the code, together with all other rules applicable to reits. provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit, our interests in the subsidiary reits will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests. if a subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, such subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years. any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a reit, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions.
the 90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions to comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. in addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. in the event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements. this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations.
the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries (or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members), which lessees contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties. the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the code). if any of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents.
if certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service ("irs") as "true leases," we may be subject to adverse tax consequences we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter into similar transactions in the future. we intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a "true lease," thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for u.s. federal income tax purposes. however, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the irs might take the position that the transaction is not a "true lease" but is more properly treated in some other manner. in the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the irs, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property. furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our reit status effective with the year of re-characterization. alternatively, the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year.
we could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities we are subject to taxes in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. our analysis of the tax act may be impacted by any corrective legislation and any guidance provided by the u.s. treasury and the irs. our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.  we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if we were subject to review or examination by the irs or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes (including the recently enacted tax act) the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of welltower inc. presented in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form 10-k. other important factors are identified in "item 1 - business" and "item 1a - risk factors" above.
executive summary company overview welltower inc. (nyse:well), an s&p 500 company headquartered in toledo, ohio, is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure. the company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people's wellness and overall health care experience. welltowertm, a real estate investment trust ("reit"), owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the united states ("u.s."), canada and the united kingdom ("u.k."), consisting of seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties. our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate assets.
the following table summarizes our consolidated portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

(1) represents consolidated noi and excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount. see non-gaap financial measures for additional information and reconciliation.
business strategy our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. to meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.
substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees/services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. these items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. to the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. to mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. we evaluate the operating environment in each property's market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. when we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.
in addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. in addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, resident fees/services and rental income represented 69% and 29%, respectively, of total revenues.  substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan, and any interest rate adjustments.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our primary sources of cash include resident fees/services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, our commercial paper program, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.
we also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. our investments generate cash from net operating income. permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.
depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. it is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. to the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured credit facility. at december 31, 2018, we had $215,376,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $100,753,000 of restricted cash and $1,853,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility.
key transactions capital  the following summarizes key capital transactions that occurred and supported new investments made during the year ended december 31, 2018:
•   in april 2018, we issued $550,000,000 of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2028 for net proceeds of approximately $545,074,000.
•   in connection with the qcp acquisition, in july 2018, we drew on a $1,000,000,000 term loan facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration and other expenses.
•   in august 2018, we issued $200,000,000 of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2028, $600,000,000 of 3.95% senior unsecured notes due 2023 and $500,000,000 of 4.95% senior unsecured notes due 2048 for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1,283,226,000. proceeds from these issuances were used to repay advances under the $1,000,000,000 term loan facility drawn on in july 2018 and the primary unsecured credit facility.
•   in july 2018, we closed on a new $3,700,000,000 unsecured credit facility with improved pricing across both our line of credit and term loan facility and terminated the existing unsecured credit facility. the credit facility includes a $3,000,000,000 revolving credit facility at a borrowing rate of 0.825% over libor, a $500,000,000 usd unsecured term credit facility at a borrowing rate of 0.90% over libor and a $250,000,000 cad unsecured term credit facility at 0.90% over cdor.
•   we extinguished $306,553,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 5.36%.
•   we repaid our $450,000,000 of 2.25% senior unsecured notes at par upon maturity on march 15, 2018.
•   we raised $794,649,000 through our dividend reinvestment program and our equity shelf program (as defined below).

dividends our board of directors announced the 2019 annual cash dividend of $3.48 per common share ($0.87 per share quarterly), consistent with 2018, beginning in february 2019. the dividend declared for the quarter ended december 31, 2018 represents the 191st consecutive quarterly dividend payment.
key performance indicators, trends and uncertainties we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions, and for budget planning purposes.
operating performance we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics") per the statement of comprehensive income are the most appropriate earnings measures. other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo"), consolidated net operating income ("noi") and same store noi ("ssnoi"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by u.s. gaap. please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliations. these earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):

credit strength  we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and internal revenue code ("irc") section 1031 deposits. the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends). we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. the coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda"). please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations, and rating of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:

operating activities  the change in net cash provided from operating activities is attributable to changes in noi, which is primarily due to acquisitions and annual rent increasers, partially offset to dispostions. please see "results of operations" below for further discussion. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, cash flows from operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders.
investing activities  the changes in net cash used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net changes in real property investments, real estate loans receivable, and investments in unconsolidated entities which are summarized above in "key transactions." please refer to notes 3, 6, and 7 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. the following is a summary of cash used in non-acquisition capital improvement activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

the change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods. renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position, and/or achieve property stabilization. generally, these expenditures have increased as a result of acquisitions, primarily in our seniors housing operating segment.
financing activities  the changes in net cash provided from financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuance/redemptions of common and preferred stock and dividend payments which are summarized above in "key transactions." please refer to notes 9, 10 and 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2018, we had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership generally ranging from 10% to 50%. we use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. at december 31, 2018, we had fourteen outstanding letter of credit obligations. please see notes 7, 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

capital structure please refer to "credit strength" above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends. our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. none of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. however, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. we plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.
on may 17, 2018, we filed with the securities and exchange commission (1) an open-ended automatic or "universal" shelf registration statement covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units and (2) a registration statement in connection with our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan ("drip") under which we may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock. as of february 13, 2019, 8,526,222 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the drip registration statement. on august 3, 2018, we entered into separate amended and restated equity distribution agreements with each of morgan stanley & co. llc; merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated; goldman sachs & co. llc; ubs securities llc and wells fargo securities, llc relating to the offer and sale from time to time of up to $784,083,001 aggregate amount of our common stock ("equity shelf program"). the equity shelf program also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements. we expect that, if entered into, we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates on or prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive per share cash proceeds at settlement equal to the forward sale price under the relevant forward sale agreement.  however, we may elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. as of february 13, 2019, we had $227,958,000 of remaining capacity under the equity shelf program and there were no outstanding forward sales agreements. depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility.

during the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. additionally, a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. during inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.

fluctuations in resident fees/services and property operating expenses are primarily a result of acquisitions, segment transitions and the movement of u.s. and foreign currency exchange rates. the fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are due to acquisitions and variations in amortization of short-lived intangible assets. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. the decrease in other income for the year ended december 31, 2018 is primarily a result of insurance proceeds received during 2017 relating to a property as well as a bargain purchase gain recognized in conjunction with a single property acquisition.
during the three years presented, we recorded impairment charges on certain held for sale properties as the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell. the fluctuations in gains (losses) on real estate dispositions are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. beginning january 1, 2017, transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized

the majority of our seniors housing operating properties are formed through partnership interests. the fluctuations in income (loss) from unconsolidated entities are largely due to the recognition of impairments related to one of our investments in unconsolidated entities during the year ended december 31, 2017. losses are also attributable to depreciation and amortization of short-lived intangible assets related to certain investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income (loss) related to joint ventures.

the 2017 and 2018 decreases in rental income are primarily attributable to the disposition of properties exceeding new acquisitions, segment transitions and the reduction in the genesis healthcare ("genesis") annual cash rent obligation due to the restructuring of the master lease as of january 1, 2018. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index ("cpi") and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant's properties. these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. if gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the cpi do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  for the three months ended december 31, 2018, we had 17 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.18% to 0.76% in our triple-net portfolio. the decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to the volume of loan payoffs during the three years presented. the increase in other income for the year ended december 31, 2018 is primarily due to $10,805,000 of net lease termination fees recognized.
depreciation and amortization decreased primarily as a result of the disposition of triple-net properties exceeding acquisition and segment transitions. to the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.
the provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed in "critical accounting policies" below and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded provision for loan losses related to certain first mortgage loans to genesis of $62,966,000 and $6,935,000, respectively.
during the three years presented, we recorded impairment charges on certain held for sale properties as the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell. the fluctuations in gains on real estate dispositions are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. beginning january 1, 2017, transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price.

total interest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees.  the change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. the fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable to the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. the fluctuation in loss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market adjustment recorded on the genesis available-for-sale investment in accordance with the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-01 described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. the following is a summary of our triple-net secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

the fluctuations in rental income are primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed outpatient medical properties, offset by dispositions. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the cpi. these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. if the cpi does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. for the three months ended december 31, 2018, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 77,850 square feet of new leases and 184,349 square feet of renewals. the weighted-average term of these leases was seven years, with a rate of $36.23 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $21.90 per square foot. substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 2.0% to 3.9%.
the fluctuation in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of new outpatient medical facilities, offset by dispositions. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. during 2016 and 2017, we recognized impairment charges related to certain held-for-sale properties as the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values less costs to sell. changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, we completed one outpatient medical construction project representing $11,358,000 or $296 per square foot. the following is a summary of outpatient medical construction projects pending as of december 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

the change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments. please refer to note 10 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. the change in interest expense on our primary unsecured credit facility is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. please refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our primary unsecured credit facility. loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances. the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2016 is due to the early extinguishment of the 2017 senior unsecured notes. the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2018 is due to the term loan facility drawn on in july 2018 and paid off in august 2018.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 2.69%, 2.83% and 3.63%, respectively. the decrease in general and administrative expenses since 2016 is primarily related to a reduction in professional service fees for tax and legal consulting and compensation costs as a result of execution of our strategic initiatives.
other expenses for 2017 primarily represents $40,730,000 of costs related to finalization of an agreement with the university of toledo foundation to transfer our corporate headquarters as a donation. other expenses for all years also includes severance-related costs associated with the departure of certain executive officers and key employees.
the fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to benefits recognized in the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the release of a valuation allowance reserve on a taxable subsidiary and the restructuring of an unconsolidated investment. the decrease in preferred dividends and the preferred stock redemption charge are due to the redemption of our 6.5% series j preferred stock during the three months ended march 31, 2017.
other non-gaap financial measures we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics"), as defined by u.s. gaap, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. however, we consider ffo, noi, ssnoi, ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u.s. gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. however, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. in response, the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. ffo, as defined by nareit, means nics, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.
consolidated net operating income ("noi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. we define noi as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our seniors housing operating and outpatient medical facility properties. these expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. general and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations. these expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses, and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. same store noi ("ssnoi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. as used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the reporting period subsequent to january 1, 2016. land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties acquired, developed /redeveloped, transitioned, sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts. we believe noi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. we use noi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
ebitda stands for earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. we believe that ebitda, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. we primarily utilize ebitda to measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents ebitda divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents ebitda divided by fixed charges. fixed charges include total interest, secured debt principal amortization, and preferred dividends. covenants in our senior unsecured notes and primary unsecured credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to those agreements. failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we have disclosed adjusted ebitda, which represents ebitda as defined above excluding unconsolidated entities and adjusted for items per our covenant. we use adjusted ebitda to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50 times.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. additionally, these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management. none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.
the table below reflects the reconciliation of ffo to nics, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure, for the periods presented. noncontrolling interest and unconsolidated entity amounts represent adjustments to reflect our share of depreciation and amortization, gains/loss on real estate dispositions and impairments of assets.  amounts are in thousands except for per share data.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical if:
•   the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
•   the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. however, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.
the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate:

entities are vies based on an assessment of whether (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support. we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a vie. consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. if we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the vie, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.
the consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the accounts of joint venture entities in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. in addition, we consolidate those entities deemed to be variable interest entities ("vies") in which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

on january 1, 2017, we adopted accounting standards update 2017-01, clarifying the definition of a business ("asu 2017-01") which narrows the financial accounting standards board's ("fasb") definition of a business and provides a framework that gives entities a basis for making reasonable judgments about whether a transaction involves an asset or a business. asu 2017-01 states that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the acquired asset is not a business. if this initial test is not met, an acquired asset cannot be considered a business unless it includes an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output. the primary differences between business combinations and asset acquisitions include recording the asset acquisition at relative fair value, capitalizing transaction costs, and the elimination of the measurement period in which to record adjustments to the transaction. we believe that substantially all our real estate acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions. we are applying asu 2017-01 prospectively for acquisitions after january 1, 2017. regardless of whether an acquisition is considered an asset acquisition or a business combination, the cost of real property acquired is allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair values. tangible assets primarily consist of land, buildings, and improvements. the remaining purchase price is allocated among identifiable intangible assets primarily consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. the total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant. real property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of construction period interest.   we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for improvements. amortization periods for intangibles are based on the remaining life of the lease or lease-up period.

the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. the determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans. if this evaluation indicates that there is a greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be required. a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement or if it has been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. to the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we will return these loans to income accrual status.

revenue is recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. interest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectability risk. substantially all of our operating leases contain fixed and/or contingent escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. we recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in fees, monthly as services are provided. lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days' notice.   if our evaluation indicates that collectability is not reasonably assured, we may place an investment on non-accrual or reserve against all or a portion of current income as an offset to revenue.

an impairment charge must be recognized when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. if it is determined that a permanent impairment of a long-lived asset has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value.

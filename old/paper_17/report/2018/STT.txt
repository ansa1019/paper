item 1a. risk factors forward-looking statements this form 10-k, as well as other reports and proxy materials submitted by us under the securities exchange act of 1934, registration statements filed by us under the securities act of 1933, our annual report to shareholders and other public statements we may make, may contain statements (including statements in our management's discussion and analysis included in such reports, as applicable) that are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of u.s. securities laws, including statements about our goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, strategies, cost savings and transformation initiatives, investment portfolio performance, dividend and stock purchase programs, outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, client growth and new technologies, services and opportunities, as well as industry, governmental, regulatory, economic and market trends, initiatives and developments, the business environment and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts.
terminology such as "plan," "expect," "intend," "objective," "forecast," "outlook," "believe," "priority," "anticipate," "estimate," "seek," "may," "will," "trend," "target," "strategy" and "goal," or similar statements or variations of such terms, are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such terms.
forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which change over time, are based on management's expectations and assumptions at the time the statements are made, and are not guarantees of future results. management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of factors affecting the u.s. and global economies, regulatory environment and the equity, debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to state street and its subsidiaries, including state street bank. factors that could cause changes in the expectations or assumptions on which forward-looking statements are based cannot be foreseen with certainty and include, but are not limited to:
•   the financial strength of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposures or to which our clients have such exposures as a result of our acting as agent, including as an asset manager or securities lending agent;
•   increases in the volatility of, or declines in the level of, our nii, changes in the composition or valuation of the assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition (and our ability to measure the fair value of investment securities) and changes in the manner in which we fund those assets;
•   the volatility of servicing fee, management fee, trading fee and securities finance revenues due to, among other factors, the value of equity and fixed-income markets, market interest and foreign exchange rates, the volume of client transaction activity, competitive pressures in the investment servicing and asset management industries, and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to processing fees and other revenues;
•   the liquidity of the u.s. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities and inter-bank credits; the liquidity of the assets on our balance sheet and changes or volatility in the sources of such funding, particularly the deposits of our clients; and demands upon our liquidity, including the liquidity demands and requirements of our clients;
•   the level and volatility of interest rates, the valuation of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies in which we record revenue or accrue expenses and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the u.s. and internationally; and the impact of monetary and fiscal policy in the u.s. and internationally on prevailing rates of interest and currency exchange rates in the markets in which we provide services to our clients;
•   the credit quality, credit-agency ratings and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of such securities and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income;
•   our ability to attract deposits and other low-cost, short-term funding; our ability to manage the level and pricing of such deposits and the relative portion of our deposits that are determined to be operational under regulatory guidelines; and our ability to deploy deposits in a profitable manner consistent with our liquidity needs, regulatory requirements and risk profile;

actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results due to the factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this form 10-k or disclosed in our other sec filings. forward-looking statements in this form 10-k should not be relied on as representing our expectations or assumptions as of any time subsequent to the time this form 10-k is filed with the sec. we undertake no obligation to revise our forward-looking statements after the time they are made. the factors discussed herein are not intended to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses. we cannot anticipate all developments that may adversely affect our business or operations or our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions, and should not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate state street. any investor in state street should consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our sec filings, including our filings under the securities exchange act of 1934, in particular our annual reports on form 10-k, our quarterly reports on form 10-q and our current reports on form 8-k, or registration statements filed under the securities act of 1933, all of which are accessible on the sec's website at www.sec.gov or on the "investor relations" section of our corporate website at www.statestreet.com.
risk factors in the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks. the following is a discussion of risk factors applicable to us. additional information about our risk management framework is included under "risk management" in management's discussion and analysis in this form 10-k. additional risks beyond those described in our management's discussion and analysis or in the following discussion may apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted, or as we may conduct them in the future, or in the markets in which we operate or may in the future operate.
credit and counterparty, liquidity and market risks we assume significant credit risk to counterparties, many of which are major financial institutions. these financial institutions and other counterparties may also have substantial financial dependencies with other financial institutions and sovereign entities. these credit exposures and concentrations could expose us to financial loss.
the financial markets are characterized by extensive interdependencies among numerous parties, including banks, central banks, broker/dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions.
these financial institutions also include collective investment funds, such as mutual funds, ucits and hedge funds that share these interdependencies. many financial institutions, including collective investment funds, also hold, or are exposed to, loans, sovereign debt, fixed-income securities, derivatives, counterparty and other forms of credit risk in amounts that are material to their financial condition. as a result of our own business practices and these interdependencies, we and many of our clients have concentrated counterparty exposure to other financial institutions and collective investment funds, particularly large and complex institutions, sovereign issuers, mutual funds, ucits and hedge funds. although we have procedures for monitoring both individual and aggregate counterparty risk, significant individual and aggregate counterparty exposure is inherent in our business, as our focus is on servicing large institutional investors.
in the normal course of our business, we assume concentrated credit risk at the individual obligor, counterparty or group level. such concentrations may be material and can often exceed 10% of our consolidated total shareholders' equity. our material counterparty exposures change daily, and the counterparties or groups of related counterparties to which our risk exposure exceeds 10% of our consolidated total shareholders' equity are also variable during any reported period; however, our largest exposures tend to be to other financial institutions.
concentration of counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of our counterparties (or in some cases of our clients' counterparties) has the potential to expose us to risk of financial loss. changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions or sovereign issuers can occur rapidly, are often based on a variety of factors and are difficult to predict.
this was observed during the financial crisis that began in 2007-2008, when economic, market, political and other factors contributed to the perception of many financial institutions and sovereign issuers as being less credit worthy. this led to credit downgrades of numerous large u.s. and non-u.s. financial institutions and several sovereign issuers (which exposure stressed the perceived creditworthiness of financial institutions, many of which invest in, accept collateral in the form of, or value other transactions based on the debt or other securities issued by sovereigns) and substantially reduced value and liquidity in the market for their credit instruments. these or other factors could again contribute to similar consequences or other market risks associated with reduced levels of liquidity. as a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risks, either resulting from our role as principal or because of commitments we make in our capacity as agent for some of our clients.
state street corporation | 20
additional areas where we experience exposure to credit risk include:
•   short-term credit. the degree of client demand for short-term credit tends to increase during periods of market turbulence, which may expose us to further counterparty- related risks. for example, investors in collective investment vehicles for which we act as custodian may experience significant redemption activity due to adverse market or economic news. our relationship with our clients and the nature of the settlement process for some types of payments may result in the extension of short-term credit in such circumstances. we also provide committed lines of credit to support such activity. for some types of clients, we provide credit to allow them to leverage their portfolios, which may expose us to potential loss if the client experiences investment losses or other credit difficulties.
•   industry and country risks. in addition to our exposure to financial institutions, we are from time to time exposed to concentrated credit risk at an industry or country level. this concentration risk also applies to groups of unrelated counterparties that may have similar investment strategies involving one or more particular industries, regions, or other characteristics. these unrelated counterparties may concurrently experience adverse effects to their performance, liquidity or reputation due to events or other factors affecting such investment strategies. though potentially not material individually (relative to any one such counterparty), our credit exposures to such a group of counterparties could expose us to a single market or political event or a correlated set of events that, in the aggregate, could have a material adverse impact on our business.
•   subcustodian risks. our use of unaffiliated subcustodians exposes us to credit risk, in addition to other risks, such as operational risk, dependencies on credit extensions and risks of the legal systems of the jurisdictions in which the subcustodians operate, each of which may be material. our operating model exposes us to risk of unaffiliated sub-custodians to a degree greater than some of our competitors who have banking operations in more jurisdictions than us. our sub-custodians operate in all jurisdictions in which our clients invest, including emerging and other underdeveloped markets that entail heightened risks. these risks are amplified due to changing regulatory requirements with respect to our financial exposures in the event those subcustodians are unable to return a client's assets, including, in some regulatory regimes, such as the e.u.'s ucits v directive, requirements that we be responsible for resulting losses suffered by our clients. we may agree to similar or more stringent standards with clients that are not subject to such regulations.
•   settlement risks. we are exposed to settlement risks, particularly in our payments and foreign exchange activities. those activities may lead to extension of credit and consequent losses in the event of a counterparty breach, failure to provide credit extensions or an operational error. due to our membership in several industry clearing or settlement exchanges, we may be required to guarantee obligations and liabilities, or provide financial support, in the event that other members do not honor their obligations or default. moreover, not all of our counterparty exposure is secured, and even when our exposure is secured, the realizable value of the collateral may have declined by the time we exercise our rights against that collateral. this risk may be particularly acute if we are required to sell the collateral into an illiquid or temporarily-impaired market or with respect to clients protected by sovereign immunity. we are exposed to risk of short-term credit or overdraft of our clients in connection with the process to facilitate settlement of trades and related foreign exchange activities, particularly when contractual settlement has been agreed with our clients. the occurrence of overdrafts at peak volatility could create significant credit exposure to our clients depending upon the value of such clients' collateral at the time.
•   securities lending and repurchase agreement indemnification. on behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. in the event of a failure of the borrower to return such securities, we typically agree to indemnify our clients for the amount by which the fair market value of those securities exceeds the proceeds of the disposition of the collateral recalled from the borrower in connection with such transaction. we also lend and borrow securities as riskless principal, and in connection with those transactions receive a security interest in securities held by the borrowers in their securities portfolios and advance cash or securities as collateral to securities lenders. borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the loaned securities. as the fair market value of the loaned securities or state street corporation | 21
collateral changes, additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower. in addition, our agency securities lending clients often purchase securities or other financial instruments from financial counterparties, including broker/dealers, under repurchase arrangements, frequently as a method of reinvesting the cash collateral they receive from lending their securities. under these arrangements, the counterparty is obligated to repurchase these securities or financial instruments from the client at the same price (plus an agreed rate of return) at some point in the future. the value of the collateral is intended to exceed the counterparty's payment obligation, and collateral is adjusted daily to account for shortfall under, or excess over, the agreed-upon collateralization level. as with the securities lending program, we agree to indemnify our clients from any loss that would arise on a default by the counterparty under these repurchase arrangements if the proceeds from the disposition of the securities or other financial assets held as collateral are less than the amount of the repayment obligation by the client's counterparty. in such instances of counterparty default, for both securities lending and repurchase agreements, we, rather than our client, are exposed to the risks associated with collateral value.
•   stable value arrangements. we enter into stable value wrap derivative contracts with unaffiliated stable value funds that allow a stable value fund to provide book value coverage to its participants. during the financial crisis, the book value of obligations under many of these contracts exceeded the market value of the underlying portfolio holdings. concerns regarding the portfolio of investments protected by such contracts, or regarding the investment manager overseeing such an investment option, may result in redemption demands from stable value products covered by benefit-responsive contracts at a time when the portfolio's market value is less than its book value, potentially exposing us to risk of loss.
•   u.s. municipal obligations remarketing credit facilities. we provide credit facilities in connection with the remarketing of u.s. municipal obligations, potentially exposing us to credit exposure to the municipalities issuing such bonds and contingent liquidity risk.
•   senior secured bank loans. in recent years, we have increased our investment in senior secured bank loans, both in the u.s. and in europe. we invest in these loans to non-investment grade borrowers through participation in loan syndications in the non-investment grade lending market. we rate these loans as "speculative" under our internal risk-rating framework, and these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans. we are therefore at a higher risk of default with respect to these investments relative to other of our investments activities. in addition, unlike other financial institutions that may have an active role in managing individual loan compliance, our investment in these loans is generally as a passive investor with limited control. as this portfolio grows and becomes more seasoned, our allowance for loan losses related to these loans may increase through additional provisions for credit losses.
•   commercial real estate. we have recently launched an initiative financing commercial and multi-family properties, which serve as collateral for our loans. although collateralized, these loans may become under-secured if the value of the collateral was over-estimated or changes. loan payments are dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying collateral property to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the loan in a timely fashion. a material decline in real estate markets or economic conditions could negatively impact value or property performance, which could adversely impact timely loan repayment, which may result in increased provision for losses on loans, and actual losses, either of which would have an adverse impact on our net income. we seek to minimize these risks by maintaining lending policies and procedures and underwriting standards, however, there can be no assurance that these will protect us from credit-related losses or delinquencies.
•   unavailability of netting. we are generally not able to net exposures across counterparties that are affiliated entities and may not be able in all circumstances to net exposures to the same legal entity across multiple products. as a consequence, we may incur a loss in relation to one entity or product even though our exposure to an entity's affiliates or across product types is over-collateralized. in some cases, for example in our securities finance and foreign exchange activities, we are able to enter into netting agreements that allow us to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another. in the event we become unable, due to operational constraints, actions by regulators, changes in accounting principles, law or regulation (or related interpretations) or other factors, to net some or all of our offsetting exposures and payment state street corporation | 22
obligations under those agreements, we would be required to gross up our assets and liabilities on our statement of condition and our calculation of rwa, accordingly.  this would result in a potentially material increase in our regulatory ratios, including lcr, and present increased credit, liquidity, asset-and-liability management and operational risks, some of which could be material.
under evolving regulatory restrictions on credit exposure we may be required to limit our exposures to specific issuers or counterparties or groups of counterparties, including, without limitation, financial institutions and sovereign issuers, to levels that we may currently exceed. these credit exposure restrictions under such evolving regulations have and may further adversely affect certain of our businesses, may require that we expand our credit exposure to a broader range of issuers and counterparties, including issuers and counterparties that represent increased credit risk and may require that we modify our operating models or the policies and practices we use to manage our consolidated statement of condition. the effects of these considerations may increase when evaluated under a stressed environment in stress testing, including ccar. in addition, we are an adherent to the isda 2015 universal resolution stay protocol and as such are subject to restrictions against the exercise of rights and remedies against fellow adherents, including, without limitation, other major financial institutions, in the event they or an affiliate of theirs enters into resolution. although our overall business is subject to these factors, several of our activities are particularly sensitive to them including, without limitation, our currency trading business and our securities finance business.
given the limited number of strong counterparties in the current market, we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients' counterparty credit risk.
our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in market factors including, without limitation, interest rates, credit spreads and credit performance.
our investment securities portfolio represented approximately 36% of our total assets as of december 31, 2018. the gross interest income associated with our investment portfolio represented approximately 13% of our total gross revenue for the year ended december 31, 2018 and has represented as much as 31% of our total gross revenue in the fiscal years since 2007. as such, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are materially exposed to the risks associated with our investment portfolio, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, credit spreads, credit performance (including, without limitation, risk of default), credit ratings, our access to liquidity, foreign exchange markets and mark- to-market valuations, and our ability to profitably manage changes in repayment rates of principal with respect to our portfolio securities. despite recent increases to interest rates in the u.s., the continued low interest rate environment that has persisted since the financial crisis began in mid-2007 limits our ability to achieve a nim consistent with our historical averages. any further increases in interest rates in the u.s. have the potential to improve nii and nim over time. however, any such improvement could be mitigated due to a greater disparity between interest rates in the u.s. and international markets, especially to the extent that interest rates remain low in europe and japan. higher interest rates could also reduce mark-to-market valuations further. in addition, recently introduced regulatory liquidity standards, such as the lcr, require that we maintain minimum levels of hqla in our investment portfolio, which generally generate lower rates of return than other investment assets. this has resulted in increased levels of hqla as a percentage of our investment portfolio and an associated negative impact on our nii and our nim. as a result we may not be able to attain our historical levels of nii and nim. for additional information regarding these liquidity requirements, refer to the "liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio" section of "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k. we may enter into derivative transactions to hedge or manage our exposure to interest rate risk, as well as other risks, such as foreign exchange risk and credit risk. derivative instruments that we hold for these or other purposes may not achieve their intended results and could result in unexpected losses or stresses on our liquidity or capital resources.
our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion of our consolidated statement of condition and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion (approximately 11% of our total assets as of december 31, 2018), in comparison to many other major financial institutions. in some respects, the accounting and regulatory treatment of our investment securities portfolio may be less favorable to us than a more traditional held-for-investment lending portfolio. for example, under the basel iii final rule, after-tax changes in the fair value of afs investment securities, such as those which represent a majority of our investment portfolio, are included in tier 1 capital. since loans held for investment are not subject to a fair value accounting framework, changes in the fair value of loans (other than incurred credit losses) are not similarly included in the determination of tier 1 capital under the basel iii final rule. due to this differing treatment, we may experience increased variability in our tier 1 capital relative to other major financial institutions whose loan-and-lease portfolios represent a larger proportion of their state street corporation | 23
consolidated total assets than ours.
additional risks associated with our investment portfolio include:
•   asset class concentration. our investment portfolio continues to have significant concentrations in several classes of securities, including, without limitation, agency residential mbs, commercial mbs and other abs, and securities with concentrated exposure to consumers. these classes and types of securities experienced significant liquidity, valuation and credit quality deterioration during the financial crisis that began in mid-2007. we also hold non-u.s. mbs and abs with exposures to european countries, whose sovereign-debt markets have experienced increased stress at times since 2011 and may continue to experience stress in the future. for further information, refer to the risk factor titled "our businesses have significant european operations, and disruptions in european economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition". further, we hold a portfolio of u.s. state and municipal bonds, the value of which may be affected by the budget deficits that a number of states and municipalities currently face, resulting in risks associated with this portfolio.
•   effects of market conditions. if market conditions deteriorate, our investment portfolio could experience a decline in market value, whether due to a decline in liquidity or an increase in the yield required by investors to hold such securities, regardless of our credit view of our portfolio holdings. for example, we recorded significant losses not related to credit in connection with the consolidation of our off-balance sheet asset-backed commercial paper conduits in 2009 and the repositioning of our investment portfolio in 2010. in addition, in general, deterioration in credit quality, or changes in management's expectations regarding repayment timing or in management's investment intent to hold securities to maturity, in each case with respect to our portfolio holdings, could result in otti. similarly, if a material portion of our investment portfolio were to experience credit deterioration, our capital ratios as calculated pursuant to the basel iii final rule could be adversely affected. this risk is greater with portfolios of investment securities that contain credit risk than with holdings of u.s. treasury securities.
•   effects of interest rates. our investment portfolio is further subject to changes in both u.s. and non-u.s. (primarily in europe) interest rates, and could be negatively affected by changes in those rates, whether or not expected. this is particularly true in the case of a quicker-than-anticipated increase in interest rates, which would decrease market values in the near-term, or monetary policy that results in persistently low or negative rates of interest on certain investments. the latter has been the case, for example, with respect to ecb monetary policy, including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions, with associated negative effects on our investment portfolio reinvestment, nii and nim. the effect on our nii has been exacerbated by the effects in recent fiscal years of the strong u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly the euro. if european interest rates remain low or decrease and the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to the euro, the negative effects on our nii likely will continue or increase. the overall level of nii can also be impacted by the size of our deposit base, as further increases in interest rates could lead to reduced deposit levels and also lower overall nii. further, a reduction in deposit levels could increase the requirements under the regulatory liquidity standards requiring us to invest a greater proportion of our investment portfolio holdings in hqla that have lower yields than other investable assets. see also, "our business activities expose us to interest rate risk" in this section.
our business activities expose us to interest rate risk.
in our business activities, we assume interest rate risk by investing short-term deposits received from our clients in our investment portfolio of longer- and intermediate-term assets. our nii and nim are affected by among other things, the levels of interest rates in global markets, changes in the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates, the direction and speed of interest rate changes and the asset and liability spreads relative to the currency and geographic mix of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. these factors are influenced, among other things, by a variety of economic and market forces and expectations, including, without limitation, monetary policy and other activities of central banks, such as the federal reserve and ecb, that we do not control. our ability to anticipate changes in these factors or to hedge the related on- and off-balance sheet exposures, and the cost of any such hedging activity, can significantly influence the success of our asset-and-liability management activities and the resulting level of our nii and nim. the impact of changes in interest rates and related factors will depend on the relative duration and fixed- or floating-rate nature of our assets and liabilities. sustained lower interest rates, a flat or inverted yield state street corporation | 24
curve and narrow credit spreads generally have a constraining effect on our nii. in addition, our ability to change deposit rates in response to changes in interest rates and other market and related factors is limited by client relationship considerations. for additional information about the effects on interest rates on our business, refer to the market risk management section, "asset-and-liability management activities" in our management's discussion and analysis in this form 10-k.
if we are unable to effectively manage our liquidity, including by continuously attracting deposits and other short-term funding, our consolidated financial condition, including our regulatory capital ratios, our consolidated results of operations and our business prospects, could be adversely affected.
liquidity management, including on an intra-day basis, is critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and to our ability to service our client base. we generally use our liquidity to:
•   meet clients' demands for return of their deposits;
•   extend credit to our clients in connection with our investor services businesses; and
•   fund the pool of long- and intermediate-term assets that are included in the investment securities carried in our consolidated statement of condition.
because the demand for credit by our clients, particularly settlement related extensions of credit, is difficult to predict and control, and may be at its peak at times of disruption in the securities markets, and because the average maturity of our investment securities portfolio is longer than the contractual maturity of our client deposit base, we need to continuously attract, and are dependent on access to, various sources of short-term funding. during periods of market disruption, the level of client deposits held by us has in recent years tended to increase; however, since such deposits are considered to be transitory, we have historically deposited so-called excess deposits with u.s. and non-u.s. central banks and in other highly liquid but low-yielding instruments. these levels of excess client deposits, as a consequence, have increased our nii but have adversely affected our nim.
in managing our liquidity, our primary source of short-term funding is client deposits, which are predominantly transaction-based deposits by institutional investors. our ability to continue to attract these deposits, and other short-term funding sources such as certificates of deposit, is subject to variability based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, volume and volatility in global financial markets, the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these deposits, the perception of safety of these deposits or short-term obligations relative to alternative short-term investments available to our clients, including, without limitation, the capital markets, and the classification of certain deposits for regulatory purposes and related discussions we may have from time to time with clients regarding better balancing our clients' cash management needs with our economic and regulatory objectives.
the parent company is a non-operating holding company and generally maintains only limited cash and other liquid resources at any time primarily to meet anticipated near-term obligations. to effectively manage our liquidity we routinely transfer assets among affiliated entities, subsidiaries and branches. internal or external factors, such as regulatory requirements and standards, including, without limitation, resolution planning, influence our liquidity management and may limit our ability to effectively transfer liquidity internally which could, among other things, restrict our ability to fund operations, dividends or stock repurchases, require us to seek external and potentially more costly capital and impact our liquidity position.
in addition, while not obligations of ours, the investment products that we manage for third parties may be exposed to liquidity risks. these products may be funded on a short-term basis, or the clients participating in these products may have a right to the return of cash or assets on limited notice. these business activities include, among others, securities finance collateral pools, money market and other short-term investment funds and liquidity facilities utilized in connection with municipal bond programs. if clients demand a return of their cash or assets, particularly on limited notice, and these investment pools do not have the liquidity to support those demands, we could be forced to sell investment securities held by these asset pools at unfavorable prices, damaging our reputation as an asset manager and potentially exposing us to claims related to our management of the pools.
the availability and cost of credit in short-term markets are highly dependent on the markets' perception of our liquidity and creditworthiness. our efforts to monitor and manage our liquidity risk, including on an intra-day basis, may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other event-driven reductions in liquidity. as a result of such events, among other things, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing our nii, or we may need to dispose of a portion of our investment securities portfolio, which, depending on market conditions, could result in a loss from such sales of investment securities being recorded in our consolidated statement of income.

our business and capital-related activities, including our ability to return capital to shareholders and repurchase our capital stock, may be adversely affected by our implementation of regulatory capital and liquidity standards that we must meet or in the event our capital plan or post-stress capital ratios are determined to be insufficient as a result of regulatory capital stress testing.
basel iii and dodd-frank act we are required to calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both the basel iii advanced approaches and the basel iii standardized approach, and we are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches and those calculated under the standardized approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy.
in implementing various aspects of these capital regulations, we are making interpretations of the regulatory intent. the federal reserve may determine that we are not in compliance with the capital rules and may require us to take actions to come into compliance that could adversely affect our business operations, our regulatory capital structure, our capital ratios or our financial performance, or otherwise restrict our growth plans or strategies. in addition, banking regulators could change the basel iii final rule or their interpretations as they apply to us, including, without limitation, changes to these standards or interpretations made in regulations implementing provisions of the dodd-frank act, which could adversely affect us and our ability to comply with the basel iii final rule.
along with the basel iii final rule, banking regulators also introduced additional requirements, such as the slr, lcr and the proposed nsfr, each of which presents compliance risks.
for example, the specification of the various elements of the nsfr in the final rule could have a material effect on our business activities, including, without limitation, the management and composition of our investment securities portfolio and our ability to extend credit through committed facilities, loans to our clients or our principal securities lending activities. in addition, further capital and liquidity requirements are under consideration by u.s. and international banking regulators. any of these rules could have a material effect on our capital and liquidity planning and related activities, including, without limitation, the management and composition of our investment securities portfolio and our ability to extend committed contingent credit facilities to our clients. the full effects of these rules, and of other regulatory initiatives related to capital or liquidity, on us and state street bank are subject to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.
systemic importance as a g-sib, we generally expect to be held to the most stringent provisions under the basel iii final rule. for example, we are subject to the federal reserve's final rules on the implementation of capital surcharges for u.s. g-sibs, and on tlac, ltd and clean holding company requirements for u.s. g-sibs which we refer to as the "tlac final rule". for additional information on these requirements, refer to the "regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards" section under "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors are not subject to the same additional capital requirements.
comprehensive capital analysis and review we are required by the federal reserve to conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and to develop an annual capital plan as part of the federal reserve's ccar process. that process, the severity and other characteristics of which may evolve from year-to-year, is used by the federal reserve to evaluate our management of capital, the adequacy of our regulatory capital and the requirement for us to maintain capital above our minimum regulatory capital requirements under stressed economic conditions. the results of the ccar process are difficult to predict due, among other things, to the federal reserve's use of proprietary stress models that differ from our internal models. the amounts of the planned capital actions in our capital plan in any year, including, without limitation, stock repurchases and dividends, may be substantially reduced from the amounts included in prior capital plans. these reductions may reflect changes in one or more different factors, including, without limitation, our business prospects and related capital needs, our capital position, proposed acquisitions or other uses of capital, the models used in our capital planning process, the supervisory models used by the federal reserve to stress our balance sheet, the federal reserve's hypothetical economic scenarios for the ccar process, the federal reserve's ccar instructions and the federal reserve's supervisory expectations for the capital planning process. the federal reserve may object to our capital plan or impose conditions on us in connection with a non-objection to our capital plan, or we may decide that we need to adjust our capital plan to avoid an objection by the federal reserve. any of these potential events potentially could require us, as applicable, to revise our stress-testing or capital management approaches, resubmit our capital plan or postpone, cancel or alter our planned capital actions. in addition, changes in our business strategy, merger or acquisition activity or uses state street corporation | 26
of capital could result in a change in our capital plan and its associated capital actions, and may require us to resubmit our capital plan to the federal reserve for its non-objection. we are also subject to asset quality reviews and stress testing by the ecb and in the future we may be subject to similar reviews and testing by other regulators.
our implementation of capital and liquidity requirements, including our capital plan, may not be approved or may be objected to by the federal reserve, and the federal reserve may impose capital requirements in excess of our expectations or require us to maintain levels of liquidity that are higher than we may expect and which may adversely affect our consolidated revenues. in the event that our implementation of capital and liquidity requirements under regulatory initiatives or our current capital structure are determined not to conform with current and future capital requirements, our ability to deploy capital in the operation of our business or our ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to repurchase our capital stock may be constrained, and our business may be adversely affected. in addition, we may choose to forgo business opportunities, due to their impact on our capital plan or stress tests, including, without limitation, ccar. likewise, in the event that regulators in other jurisdictions in which we have banking subsidiaries determine that our capital or liquidity levels do not conform with current and future regulatory requirements, our ability to deploy capital, our levels of liquidity or our business operations in those jurisdictions may be adversely affected.
for additional information about the above matters, refer to "regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards" section under "supervision and regulation" in business and "capital" section under "financial condition" in our management's discussion and analysis in this form 10-k.
fee revenue represents a significant majority of our consolidated revenue and is subject to decline, among other things, in the event of a reduction in, or changes to, the level or type of investment activity by our clients.
we rely primarily on fee-based services to derive our revenue. this contrasts with commercial banks that may rely more heavily on interest-based sources of revenue, such as loans. during 2018 total fee revenue represented approximately 78% of our total revenue. fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by foreign exchange trading services, securities finance and processing fees and other revenue.
the level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including, without limitation, the mix and volume of our auc/a and our aum, the value and type of securities positions held (with respect to assets under custody) and the volume of our clients' portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by our clients. for example, reductions in the level of economic and capital markets activity tend to have a negative effect on our fee revenue, as these often result in reduced asset valuations and transaction volumes. they may also result in investor preference trends towards asset classes and markets deemed more secure, such as cash or non-emerging markets, with respect to which our fee rates are often lower.
in addition, our clients include institutional investors, such as mutual funds, collective investment funds, ucits, hedge funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. economic, market or other factors that reduce the level or rates of savings in or with those institutions, either through reductions in financial asset valuations or through changes in investor preferences, could materially reduce our fee revenue and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
our businesses have significant european operations, and disruptions in european economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
while the european economy continued to expand in 2018, growth moderated from 2017 levels and concerns remain with regard to sovereign debt sustainability, interdependencies among financial institutions and sovereigns, the unwinding of ecb quantitative easing measures and political and other risks, including the rise of populist governments and terrorist threats in one or more european nations. in addition, continued divergence between the pace of monetary tightening in the u.s. and europe, as well as the weakening of the external environment for europe, specifically with regard to weaker external trade, have led to increased uncertainty around the sustainability of recent economic progress in europe.
in addition, the united kingdom's potential exit from the e.u., or brexit, and related developments present risks, including the potential impact on economic activity in the e.u. and the u.k. and the future relationship between the e.u. and the u.k. and the resulting arrangements around market access for financial services. given the scope of our european operations, economic or market uncertainty, volatility, illiquidity or disruption resulting from these and related factors could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. in order to conform to restrictions on activity between the e.u. and the u.k. following brexit, we are implementing organizational, operational and governance changes to our european businesses, some of which are subject to regulatory approvals or other execution risks. if we experience delays or other state street corporation | 27
challenges in implementing these changes, we may incur additional costs or inefficiencies associated with our european activities, client dissatisfaction or other difficulties in executing our regional strategy.
geopolitical and economic conditions and developments could adversely affect us, particularly if we face increased uncertainty and unpredictability in managing our businesses.
global financial markets can suffer from substantial volatility, illiquidity and disruption, particularly as a result of geopolitical disruptions and as global monetary authorities begin to withdraw monetary policy easing measures. if such volatility, illiquidity or disruption were to result in an adverse economic environment in the u.s. or internationally or result in a lack of confidence in the financial stability of major developed or emerging markets, such developments could have an adverse effect on our business, as well as the businesses of our clients and our significant counterparties and could also increase the difficulty and unpredictability of aligning our business strategies, our infrastructure and our operating costs in light of current and future market and economic conditions. these risks could be compounded by tighter monetary conditions, disruptions to free trade and political uncertainty in the u.s. and internationally.
market disruptions can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations if the value of our auc/a or aum decline, while the costs of providing the related services remain constant or increase. these factors could reduce the profitability of our asset-based fee revenue and could also adversely affect our transaction-based revenue, such as revenues from securities finance and foreign exchange activities, and the volume of transactions that we execute for or with our clients. further, the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect our foreign exchange trading revenue. in general, increased currency volatility tends to increase our market risk but also increases our opportunity to generate foreign exchange revenue. conversely, periods of lower currency volatility tend to decrease our market risk but also decrease our foreign exchange revenue.
in addition, as our business grows globally and a significant percentage of our revenue is earned (and of our expenses paid) in currencies other than u.s. dollars, our exposure to foreign currency volatility could affect our levels of consolidated revenue, our consolidated expenses and our consolidated results of operations, as well as the value of our investment in our non-u.s. operations and our non-u.s. investment portfolio holdings. the extent to which changes in the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies affect our consolidated results of operations, including, without limitation, the degree of any offset between increases or decreases to both revenue and expenses, will depend upon the nature and scope of our operations and activities in the relevant jurisdictions during the relevant periods, which may vary from period to period.
as our product offerings expand, in part as we seek to take advantage of perceived opportunities arising under various regulatory reforms and resulting market changes, the degree of our exposure to various market and credit risks will evolve, potentially resulting in greater revenue volatility. we also will need to make additional investments to develop the operational infrastructure and to enhance our compliance and risk management capabilities to support these businesses, which may increase the operating expenses of such businesses or, if our control environment fails to keep pace with product expansion, result in increased risk of loss from such businesses.
we may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future, which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms.
we may need to raise additional capital in order to maintain our credit ratings, in response to regulatory changes, including capital rules, or for other purposes, including, without limitation, financing acquisitions and joint ventures. for example, in december 2018, we issued additional long-term debt in order to meet requirements under the federal reserve's tlac final rule, and in september 2018 and july 2018 we issued preferred stock and common stock, respectively, to finance our acquisition of charles river development.
however, our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, on a timely basis or at all will depend on a number of factors, such as the state of the financial markets and securities law requirements and standards. in the event of rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors that would increase our cost of borrowing, we cannot be sure of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. any diminished ability to raise additional capital, if needed, could adversely affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals, including, without limitation, the financing of acquisitions and joint ventures and our efforts to maintain regulatory compliance.
any downgrades in our credit ratings, or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, could adversely affect our borrowing costs, capital costs and liquidity position and cause reputational harm.
major independent rating agencies publish credit ratings for our debt obligations based on their evaluation of a number of factors, some of which relate to our performance and other corporate developments, including, without limitation, financings, acquisitions and joint ventures, and some of which relate to general industry conditions. we anticipate that the rating agencies will continue to review our ratings regularly state street corporation | 28
based on our consolidated results of operations and developments in our businesses, including, without limitation, regulatory considerations such as resolution planning. one or more of the major independent credit rating agencies have in the past downgraded, and may in the future downgrade, our credit ratings, or have negatively revised their outlook for our credit ratings. the current market and regulatory environment and our exposure to financial institutions and other counterparties, including, without limitation, sovereign entities, increase the risk that we may not maintain our current ratings, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to maintain our current credit ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs, our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating may also preclude us from being competitive in various products.
additionally, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. if we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, due to, including, without limitation, the effects of market or regulatory developments, announced or rumored business developments, consolidated results of operations, a decline in our stock price or a downgrade to our credit rating, our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions, secured or unsecured, with us; our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of service we provide to them or seek to transfer the business, in whole or in part, to other service providers; or our prospective clients may select other service providers, all of which may have adverse effects on our business and reputation.
the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy than other market participants is higher as a result of recent market developments which include, without limitation, an environment in which the consolidation, and in some instances failure, of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, has resulted in a smaller number of much larger counterparties and competitors. if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty, our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients, on our or our clients' behalf, will be materially compromised. if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them, our revenues will decrease accordingly.
operational, business and reputational risks we face extensive and changing government regulation in the u.s. and in non-u.s. jurisdictions in which we operate, which may increase our costs and expose us to risks related to compliance.
most of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies, and many of the clients to which we provide services are themselves subject to a broad range of regulatory requirements. these regulations may affect the scope of, and the manner and terms of delivery of, our services. as a financial institution with substantial international operations, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervisory oversight, both inside and outside of the u.s. this regulation and supervisory oversight affects, among other things, the scope of our activities and client services, our capital and organizational structure, our ability to fund the operations of our subsidiaries, our lending practices, our dividend policy, our common stock purchase actions, the manner in which we market our services, our acquisition activities and our interactions with foreign regulatory agencies and officials.
in particular, we are registered with the federal reserve as a bank holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act of 1956. the bank holding company act generally limits the activities in which we and our non-banking subsidiaries may engage to managing or controlling banks and to activities considered to be closely related to banking. as a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the bank holding company act, we and some of our non-banking subsidiaries may also engage in a broader range of activities considered to be "financial in nature." financial holding company status may be denied if we and our banking subsidiaries do not remain well capitalized and well managed or fail to comply with community reinvestment act obligations. currently, under the bank holding company act, we may not be able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses.
the u.s. president issued an executive order that sets forth principles for the reform of the federal financial regulatory framework, and, in may 2018, the united states enacted egrrcpa. the egrrcpa's revisions to the u.s. financial regulatory framework, some of which remain subject to further rulemaking, have altered certain laws and regulations applicable to us and other major financial firms. it is too early to assess whether there will be any more changes to the regulatory environment or further rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework and what the impact will be on our results of operations or financial condition, including, without limitation, increased expenses or changes in the demand for our services, or on the u.s.-domestic or global economies or financial markets. we state street corporation | 29
expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. several other aspects of the regulatory environment in which we operate, and related risks, are discussed below. additional information is provided under "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
resolution planning we are required to periodically submit a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure commonly referred to as a resolution plan or a living will to the federal reserve and the fdic under section 165(d) of the dodd-frank act. through resolution planning, we seek, in the event of insolvency, to maintain state street bank's role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system, while minimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders. significant management attention and resources are required in an effort to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning.
in the event of material financial distress or failure, our preferred resolution strategy is the spoe strategy. our resolution plan, including our implementation of the spoe strategy with a secured support agreement, involves important risks, including that: (1) the spoe strategy and the obligations under the support agreement may result in the recapitalization of state street bank and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the parent company at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place; (2) an expected effect of the spoe strategy, together with applicable tlac regulatory requirements, is that our losses will be imposed on parent company shareholders and the holders of long-term debt and other forms of tlac securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the parent company, as well as on any other parent company creditors, before any of its losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of state street bank or certain of the parent company's other operating subsidiaries or any of their depositors or creditors or before u.s. taxpayers are put at risk; (3) there can be no assurance that there would be sufficient recapitalization resources available to ensure that state street bank and our other material entities are adequately capitalized following the triggering of the requirements to provide capital and/or liquidity under the support agreement; and (4) there can be no assurance that credit rating agencies, in response to our resolution plan or the support agreement, will not downgrade, place on negative watch or change their outlook on our debt credit ratings, generally or on specific debt securities. additional information about the spoe strategy, including related risks, is provided under "resolution planning" in business in this form 10-k.
systemic importance our qualification in the u.s. as a sifi, and our designation by the fsb as a g-sib, to which certain regulatory capital surcharges may apply, subjects us to incrementally higher capital and prudential requirements, increased scrutiny of our activities and potential further regulatory requirements or increased regulatory expectations than those applicable to some of the financial institutions with which we compete as a custodian or asset manager. this qualification and designation also has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our expenses associated with regulatory compliance, including personnel and systems, as well as implementation and related costs to enhance our programs.
global and non-u.s. regulatory requirements the breadth of our business activities, together with the scope of our global operations and varying business practices in relevant jurisdictions, increase the complexity and costs of meeting our regulatory compliance obligations, including in areas that are receiving significant regulatory scrutiny. we are, therefore, subject to related risks of non-compliance, including fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals, limitations on our business activities or reputational harm, any of which may be significant. for example, the global nature of our client base requires us to comply with complex laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions relating to economic sanctions and money laundering. in addition, we are required to comply not only with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, but also with the applicable anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. further, our global operating model requires that we comply with outsourcing oversight requirements, including with respect to affiliated entities, and data security standards of multiple jurisdictions and enable our clients to comply with outsourcing and data security requirements imposed upon them. regulatory scrutiny of compliance with these and other laws and regulations is increasing and may, in some respects, impede the implementation of our global operating model that is central to both delivery of client service requirements and cost efficiency. we sometimes face inconsistent laws and regulations across the various jurisdictions in which we operate. the evolving regulatory landscape may interfere with our ability to conduct our operations, with our pursuit of a common global operating model or with our ability to compete effectively with other financial institutions operating in those jurisdictions or which may be subject to different regulatory requirements than apply to us. in particular, non-u.s. regulations and initiatives that may be inconsistent or conflict with current or proposed regulations in the u.s. could create increased compliance and other costs that would adversely affect our business, operations or profitability. geopolitical events such as the u.k.'s planned exit from state street corporation | 30
the european union also have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of regulatory compliance.
in addition to u.s. regulatory initiatives, we are further affected by non-u.s. regulatory initiatives, including, without limitation, the proposed risk reduction package, the investment firm review, the review of emir, the shareholder rights directive, as well as regulatory initiatives finalized and/or implemented over the last few years such as the gdpr, ucits v, money market funds regulation mifid ii and mifir. recent, proposed or potential regulations in the u.s. and e.u. with respect to short-term wholesale funding, such as repurchase agreements or securities lending, or other "shadow banking" activities, could also adversely affect not only our own operations but also the operations of the clients to which we provide services. in addition, anti-competitive, governance and other concerns with passive investment strategies have become the focus of legislative and regulatory debate which could significantly impact both our asset management business and the clients that we service.
consequences of regulatory environment and compliance risks domestic and international regulatory reform could limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, increase our regulatory capital requirements, alter the risk profile of certain of our core activities and impose additional costs on us, otherwise adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and have other negative consequences, including, without limitation, a reduction of our credit ratings. different countries may respond to the market and economic environment in different and potentially conflicting manners, which could increase the cost of compliance for us.
the evolving regulatory environment, including changes to existing regulations and the introduction of new regulations, may also contribute to decisions we may make to suspend, reduce or withdraw from existing businesses, activities, markets or initiatives. in addition to potential lost revenue associated with any such suspensions, reductions or withdrawals, any such suspensions, reductions or withdrawals may result in significant restructuring or related costs or exposures.
if we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, delays, or difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or restrictions on our business activities or harm to our reputation, which may significantly and adversely affect our business operations and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations. the willingness of regulatory authorities to impose meaningful sanctions, and the level of fines and penalties imposed in connection with regulatory violations, have increased substantially since the financial crisis. regulatory agencies may, at times, limit our ability to disclose their findings, related actions or remedial measures. similarly, many of our clients are subject to significant regulatory requirements and retain our services in order for us to assist them in complying with those legal requirements. changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide, as well as our costs.
adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain clients. if we cause clients to fail to comply with any regulatory requirements, we may be liable to them for losses and expenses that they incur. in recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations. if this regulatory trend continues, it could continue to adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
for additional information, see the risk factor, "our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation."
we are subject to enhanced external oversight as a result of certain agreements entered into in connection with the resolution of prior regulatory or governmental matters.
in june 2015, we entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve and the massachusetts division of banks relating to deficiencies identified in our compliance programs with the requirements of the bank secrecy act, aml regulations and u.s. economic sanctions regulations promulgated by ofac. as part of this agreement, we have been required to, among other things, implement improvements to our compliance programs.
separately, in connection with the resolution of certain proceedings relating to our having charged six clients of our transition management business during 2010 and 2011 amounts in excess of the contractual terms, in january 2017, we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department of justice and the united states attorney for the district of massachusetts under which we agreed to retain an independent compliance and ethics monitor for a term of three years (subject to extension) to, among other things, review and monitor the effectiveness of our compliance controls and business ethics and make related recommendations, and in september 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with the sec that also requires us to retain an independent ethics and compliance consultant. we have retained a monitor who is fulfilling our obligations under both the deferred prosecution agreement and the sec settlement. responding to the monitor's requests entails significant cost and management attention and we are, in general, required to implement remediation plans to address any of the monitor's recommendations. these state street corporation | 31
recommendations may require substantial cost and effort to remediate and, even when consistent with our own control enhancement objectives, may reflect differences in approach, timing and cost than we may independently intend. under the deferred prosecution agreement we also have a heightened obligation promptly to report issues involving potential or alleged fraudulent activities to the doj.
as a result of the enhanced inspections and monitoring activities to which we are subject under these agreements, governmental authorities may identify areas in which we may need to take actions, which may be significant, to enhance our regulatory compliance or risk management practices. such remedial actions may entail significant cost, management attention, and systems development and such efforts may affect our ability to expand our business until such remedial actions are completed. these actions may be in addition to remedial measures required by the federal reserve and other financial regulators following examinations as a result of increased prudential expectations regarding our compliance programs, culture and risk management. our failure to implement enhanced compliance and risk management procedures in a manner and in a time frame deemed to be responsive by the applicable regulatory authority could adversely impact our relationship with such regulatory authority and could lead to restrictions on our activities or other sanctions. moreover, the identification of new or additional facts and circumstances suggesting inappropriate or non-compliant conduct, whether identified by the monitor or a regulatory authority, in the course of an inspection, or independently by us could lead to new governmental proceedings or the re-opening of matters that were previously resolved. the presence of the monitor, as well as governmental programs rewarding whistleblowing, may also increase the instances of current or former employees alleging that certain practices are inconsistent with our legal or regulatory obligations.
our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation.
the businesses in which we operate are highly-regulated and subject to extensive external scrutiny that may be directed generally to participants in the businesses or markets in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us, including as a result of whistleblower and qui tam claims. in the course of our business, we are frequently subject to various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigative demands and subpoenas, and from time to time, our clients, or the government on its own behalf or on behalf of our clients or others, make claims and take legal action relating to, among other things, our performance of our fiduciary, contractual or regulatory responsibilities. often, the announcement of any such matters, or of any settlement of a claim or action, whether it involves us or others in our industry, may spur the initiation of similar claims by other clients or governmental parties. regulatory authorities have, and are likely to continue to, initiate cross industry reviews when a material issue is identified at a financial institution. such inquiries involve costs and management time and may lead to proceedings relating to our own activities.
regardless of the outcome of any governmental enforcement or litigation matter, responding to such matters is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the attention of senior management. governmental enforcement and litigation matters can involve claims for disgorgement, demands for substantial monetary damages, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, and the imposition of remedial sanctions or other required changes in our business practices, any of which could result in increased expenses, loss of client demand for our products or services, or harm to our reputation. the exposure associated with any proceedings that may be threatened, commenced or filed against us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which we establish a reserve with respect to such potential liability or upon our reputation. in government settlements since the financial crisis, the fines imposed by authorities have increased substantially and may exceed in some cases the profit earned or harm caused by the regulatory or other breach. for example, in connection with the resolution of the transition management matter, we agreed to pay a fine of £22.9 million (approximately $37.8 million) to the u.k. fca in 2014 and fines of $32.3 million to each of the doj and the sec in 2017. as a further example, we paid an aggregate of $575 million in 2016 to resolve a series of investigations and governmental and private claims alleging that our indirect foreign exchange rates prior to 2008 were not adequately disclosed or were otherwise improper. these matters have also resulted in regulatory focus on the manner in which we charge clients and related disclosures. this focus may lead to increased and prolonged governmental inquiries and client, qui tam and whistleblower claims associated with the amount and disclosure of compensation we receive for our products and services.
moreover, u.s. and certain international governmental authorities have increasingly brought criminal actions against financial institutions, and criminal prosecutors have increasingly sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas, deferred prosecution agreements or other criminal sanctions from financial institutions. for example, in 2017 we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the u.s. department of justice in connection with the resolution of the transition management matter, and such agreement could increase the likelihood that governmental authorities will seek criminal sanctions state street corporation | 32
against us in pending or future legal proceedings. see "we are subject to various legal proceedings relating to the manner in which we have invoiced certain expenses, and the outcome of such proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations or harm our business or reputation." government authorities may also pursue criminal claims against current or former employees, and these matters can, among other things, involve continuing reputational harm to us. for example, four of our former employees were indicted by u.s. prosecutors on charges of criminal conspiracy in connection with their involvement in the transition management matter. two of these individuals pled guilty, and a third was convicted in 2018.
in many cases, we are required or may choose to report inappropriate or non-compliant conduct to the authorities, and our failure or delay to do so may represent an independent regulatory violation or be treated as an indication of non-cooperation with governmental authorities. even when we promptly report a matter, we may nonetheless experience regulatory fines, liabilities to clients, harm to our reputation or other adverse effects. moreover, our settlement or other resolution of any matter with any one or more regulators or other applicable party may not forestall other regulators or parties in the same or other jurisdictions from pursuing a claim or other action against us with respect to the same or a similar matter.
for more information about current contingencies relating to legal proceedings, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. the resolution of certain pending or potential legal or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which the relevant matter is resolved or an accrual is determined to be required, on our consolidated financial condition or on our reputation.
in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal and regulatory matters, we cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any pending or potential matter or, if determined adversely against us, the costs associated with any such matter, particularly where the claimant seeks very large or indeterminate damages or where the matter presents novel legal theories, involves a large number of parties, involves the discretion of governmental authorities in seeking sanctions or negotiated resolution or is at a preliminary stage. we may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to the risks of legal and regulatory contingencies when we record reserves for probable and estimable loss contingencies. as a result, any reserves we establish may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure. similarly, our estimates of the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss for legal and regulatory contingencies are based upon then-available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. the matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the estimate at any time.
we are subject to various legal proceedings relating to the manner in which we have invoiced certain expenses, and the outcome of such proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations, or harm our business or reputation.
in 2015, we determined we had incorrectly invoiced some of our investment servicing clients for certain expenses. we have reimbursed most of our affected customers for what we determined to be the overcharges and we have implemented enhancements to our billing processes. in connection with our enhancements to our billing processes, we continue to review historical billing practices and may from time to time identify additional required remediation. we identified, at the end of 2017, an additional area of past incorrect billing for certain mailing services expenses arising in our retirement services business. the accrual for loss contingencies at december 31, 2018 included an estimate of the amount we anticipate reimbursing clients due to that error. we currently expect the cumulative total of our payments to customers for these invoicing errors, including the error in the retirement services business, to be at least $380 million, all of which has been paid or is accrued. however, we may identify additional remediation costs. see the risk factor "our efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are ongoing and may result in the identification of additional billing errors."
in 2017, a purported class action was commenced against us alleging that our invoicing practices violated duties owed to retirement plan customers under erisa. in addition, we have received a purported class action demand letter alleging that our invoicing practices were unfair and deceptive under massachusetts law. a class of customers, or particular customers, may assert that we have not paid to them all amounts incorrectly invoiced, and may seek double or treble damages under massachusetts law.
we are also cooperating with investigations by governmental and regulatory authorities on these matters, including the civil and criminal divisions of the doj, the sec, the dol and the massachusetts attorney general, which could result in significant fines or other sanctions, civil and criminal, against us. if these governmental or regulatory authorities were to conclude that all or a portion of the billing errors merited civil or criminal sanctions, any fine or other penalty could be a significant percentage, or a multiple of, the portion of the overcharging serving as the basis of such a claim or of the full amount overcharged. the governmental and regulatory authorities have significant discretion in civil and criminal matters as to the fines and other penalties they may seek to impose. the severity of such fines or other penalties could take into account factors state street corporation | 33
such as the amount and duration of our incorrect invoicing, the government's or regulator's assessment of the conduct of our employees, as well as prior conduct such as that which resulted in our january 2017 deferred prosecution agreement in connection with transition management services and our settlement of civil claims regarding our indirect foreign exchange business. the staff of the sec has informed us that it intends to ask the sec for permission to bring an action against us asserting that we overcharged clients that are registered investment companies for custody expenses in violation of §§ 31(a), 34(b) and 37 of the investment company act of 1940, and rules 31a-1(a) and 31a-1(b) thereunder. we have submitted to the staff of the sec a response, which included a settlement proposal that the staff has indicated is too low, and we remain in discussions with the staff as to a possible settlement. our aggregate accruals for loss contingencies for legal and regulatory matters as of december 31, 2018 include the amount of penalties reflected in our most recent settlement proposal. there can be no assurance that any settlement, whether with the sec or other governmental authorities, will be reached or, if so, the amount of the settlement or its impact on other claims relating to these matters. in the first half of 2019, it is likely that discussions will commence with the doj regarding a potential resolution of their investigation regarding this matter, which will then enable us to better assess the potential penalties and/or sanctions they will be seeking. the aggregate amount of penalties that may potentially be imposed upon us in connection with the resolution of all outstanding investigations into our historical billing practices could be multiples of the potential penalties being discussed with the staff of the sec.
the outcome of any of these proceedings and, in particular, any criminal sanction could materially adversely affect our results of operations and could have significant collateral consequences for our business and reputation.
our efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are ongoing and may result in the identification of additional billing errors.
in 2015, we determined we had incorrectly invoiced some of our investment servicing clients for certain expenses. in 2016, we began the process of remediating these errors, improving our billing processes and controls in the asset servicing business and other businesses, and testing these improved billing processes and controls. as a result of such review, we may modify, enhance, and, where necessary, replace our existing global billing processes and implement and test controls for the new system. the objectives of this billing transformation process are to obtain greater billing accuracy and consistency across business lines. our goal is for this billing transformation process to be completed over the next three or more years, but there can be no assurance as to when we will complete this process or that it will allow us to meet the objectives we have set for it. because of the scale of our business, implementing enhanced billing controls will be expensive and time consuming, may not succeed in identifying and remediating all weaknesses and inefficiencies in our billing processes and cannot be implemented in all our business units concurrently. accordingly, the costs of the billing transformation process, and the costs to remediate billing errors which may be discovered in that process, would likely be incurred over a period that we are now unable accurately to determine. as we work through this process, we have discovered and may continue to discover areas where we believe our billing processes need improvement, where we believe we have made billing errors with respect to particular customers and categories of fees and expenses, and where we believe billing arrangements between ourselves and particular customers should be clarified. for example, we identified at the end of 2017 an additional area of past incorrect billing for certain mailing services expenses in our retiree services business and will be reimbursing the amounts associated with this issue to affected clients. such discoveries may lead to increased expense and decreased revenues, the need to remediate prior billing errors, government investigations, or litigation that may materially impact our business, financial results and reputation.
any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or disruptions to our continuous operations, including the systems, facilities or operations of third parties with which we do business, such as resulting from cyber-attacks, could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our business activities, costs and reputational damage.
our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure, both internal and external, to, among other things, record and process a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data, in many currencies, on a daily basis, across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions. in recent years, several financial services firms have suffered successful cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm. we also have been subjected to cyber-attacks, and although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach or suspension of our systems, it is possible that we could suffer such a breach or suspension in the future. cyber-threats are sophisticated and continually evolving. we may not implement effective systems and other measures to effectively prevent or mitigate the full diversity of cyber-threats or improve and adapt such systems and measures as such threats evolve and advance.
state street corporation | 34
our computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business continuity, disaster recovery or other operating, information or technology systems, facilities and activities may suffer disruptions or otherwise fail to operate properly or become disabled, overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including, without limitation, events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions, provide services or maintain systems availability, maintain compliance and internal controls or otherwise appropriately conduct our business activities. for example, there could be sudden increases in transaction or data volumes, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks or employee or contractor error or malfeasance. we may not successfully prevent, respond to, recover from or learn from any such disruptions or failures.
the third parties with which we do business, which facilitate our business activities, to whom we outsource operations or other activities, from whom we receive products or services or with whom we otherwise engage or interact, including, without limitation, financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers, are also susceptible to the foregoing risks (including the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by, or attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology, infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business.
in particular, we, like other financial services firms, will continue to face increasing cyber threats, including, without limitation, computer viruses, malicious code, distributed denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware, information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our, our clients' or other parties' confidential, personal, proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt, compromise or damage our or our clients' or other parties' business assets, operations and activities. our status as a global sifi likely increases the risk that we are targeted by such cyber- security threats. in addition, some of our service offerings, such as data warehousing, may also increase the risk we are, and the consequences of being, so targeted. we therefore could experience significant related costs and exposures, including, without limitation, lost or constrained ability to provide our services or maintain systems availability to clients, regulatory inquiries, enforcements, actions and fines, litigation, damage to our reputation or property and enhanced competition.
due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations, we must persist in improving and updating our information technology infrastructure, among other things, (1) as some of our systems are approaching the end of their useful life, are redundant or do not share data without reconciliation; (2) to be more efficient, meet client expectations and support opportunities of growth; and (3) to enhance resiliency and maintain business continuity. updating these systems involves material costs and often involves implementation, integration and security risks, including, without limitation, risks that we may not adequately anticipate the market or technological trends or client needs or experience unexpected challenges that could cause financial, reputational and operational harm. however, failing to properly respond to and invest in changes and advancements in technology can limit our ability to attract and retain clients, prevent us from offering similar products and services as those offered by our competitors, impair our ability to maintain continuous operations and inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements.
any theft, loss or other misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure of, or inappropriate access to, the confidential information we possess could have an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory actions, litigation and other adverse effects.
our businesses and relationships with clients are dependent on our ability to maintain the confidentiality of our and our clients' trade secrets and confidential information (including, without limitation, client transactional and holdings data and personal data about our employees, our clients and our clients' clients). unauthorized access, or failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems, may occur, potentially resulting in theft, loss, or other misappropriation of such information. in addition, our or our vendors' personnel have in the past and may in the future inadvertently disclose client or other confidential information. any theft, loss, other misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, our relationships with our clients and our reputation and could subject us to regulatory inquiries, enforcement and fines, civil litigation and possible financial liability or costs. to the extent any of these events involve personally sensitive information, the risks of enhanced regulatory scrutiny and the potential financial liabilities are exacerbated, particularly under data protection regulations such as the gdpr.
state street corporation | 35
we are subject to variability in our assets under custody and/or administration and assets under management, and in our financial results, due to the significant size of many of our institutional clients, and are also subject to significant pricing pressure due to the considerable market influence exerted by those clients.
our clients include institutional investors, such as mutual funds, collective investment funds, ucits, hedge funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. in both our asset servicing and asset management businesses, we endeavor to attract institutional investors controlling large and diverse pools of assets, as those clients typically have the opportunity to benefit from the full range of our expertise and service offerings. due to the large pools of assets controlled by these clients, the loss or gain of one client, or even a portion of the assets controlled by one client, could have a significant effect on our auc/a or our aum, as applicable, in the relevant period. loss of all or a portion of the servicing of a client's assets can occur for a variety of reasons. for example, as previously reported, as a result of a decision to diversify providers, in 2018 one of our large clients moved the servicing for a portion of its assets, largely common trust funds, to another provider. the transition represented approximately $1 trillion in assets with respect to which we will no longer derive revenue. our aum or auc/a are also affected by decisions by institutional owners to favor or disfavor certain investment instruments or categories. similarly, if one or more clients change the asset class in which a significant portion of assets are invested (e.g., by shifting investments from emerging markets to the u.s.), those changes could have a significant effect on our results of operations in the relevant period, as our fee rates often change based on the type of asset classes we are servicing or managing. in 2018, several industry-wide and company specific trends continued to impact auc/a and aum asset levels. as our fee revenue is significantly impacted by our levels of auc/a and aum, changes in levels of different asset classes could have a corresponding significant effect on our results of operations in the relevant period. large institutional clients also, by their nature, are often able to exert considerable market influence, and this, combined with strong competitive forces in the markets for our services, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge for our services in both our asset servicing and asset management lines of business. our strategy of focusing our efforts on the segments of the market for investor services represented by very large asset managers and asset owners causes us to be particularly impacted by this industry trend. many of these large clients are also under competitive and regulatory pressures that are driving them to manage the expenses that they and their investment products incur more aggressively, which in turn exacerbates their pressures on our fees.
our business may be negatively affected by adverse business decisions or our failure to properly implement or execute strategic programs and priorities.
in order to maintain and grow our business, we must make strategic decisions about our current and future business plans and effectively execute upon those plans. strategic initiatives that we are currently developing or executing against include cost initiatives, enhancements and efficiencies to our operational processes, improvements to existing and new service offerings, targeting for sales growth certain segments of the markets for investor services and asset management, and enhancements to existing and development of new information technology and other systems. implementing strategic programs and creating cost efficiencies involves certain strategic, technological and operational risks.
strategic risk in late 2015, we announced beacon, a multi-year program to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients. in 2019, we announced that, having completed our beacon program, we were launching an additional effort to reduce expenses through resource discipline, automation and process re-engineering. we may undertake additional strategic initiatives on cost management, operating effectiveness or other matters of varying sizes, some of which may be material. operational process and information technology transformations, such as beacon and the recently announced expense initiative, as well as future strategic initiatives we may undertake, entail significant risks. the new program, and any future strategic initiatives we implement, may prove to be inadequate to achieve its objectives, may not achieve the anticipated automation or process re-engineering, may not be successfully implemented or meet client expectations and may not be responsive to industry, technological or market changes. these programs also may result in increased or unanticipated costs, may result in earnings volatility, may take longer than anticipated to implement and may result in increases in operating losses, inadvertent data disclosures or other operating errors. in implementing these programs, we may have material dependencies on third parties. in addition, our efforts to manage expenses may be matched or exceeded by our competitors. any failure to implement any strategic initiative on cost management, operational effectiveness or other matters we may undertake, in whole or in part may, among other things, reduce our competitive position, diminish the cost effectiveness of our systems and processes or provide an insufficient state street corporation | 36
return on our associated investment. the success of expense management programs and our other strategic plans could also be affected by market disruptions and unanticipated changes in the overall market for financial services and the global economy. we also may not be able to abandon or alter these plans without significant loss, as the implementation of our decisions may involve significant capital outlays, often far in advance of when we expect to generate any anticipated revenues, realize expected cost savings or achieve desired operational efficiencies. accordingly, our business, our consolidated results of operations and our consolidated financial condition may be adversely affected by any failure or delay in our strategic decisions, including the program or elements thereof. for additional information about the program, see "expenses" in "consolidated results of operations" included in our management's discussion and analysis in this form 10-k.
information technology obsolescence and operational transformation many features of our initiatives include investment in systems integration and new technologies and also the development of new, and the evolution of existing, methods and tools to accelerate the pace of innovation, the introduction of new services and enhancements to the security of our data systems. the transition to new operating processes and technology infrastructure may cause disruptions in our relationships with clients and employees or loss of institutional understanding and may present other unanticipated technical or operational hurdles. in addition, the relocation to or expansion of servicing activities and other operations in different geographic regions or vendors may entail client, regulatory and other third party data use, storage and security challenges, as well as other regulatory compliance, business continuity and other considerations. as a result, we may not achieve some or all of the cost savings or other benefits anticipated and may experience unanticipated challenges from clients, regulators or other parties or reputational harm. in addition, some systems development initiatives may not have access to significant resources or management attention and, consequently, may be delayed or unsuccessful. many of our systems require enhancements to meet the requirements of evolving regulation, to enhance resiliency and decommission obsolete technologies, to permit us to optimize our use of capital or to reduce the risk of operating error. in addition, the implementation of our front to back office platform and integration of charles river development will require substantial systems development and expense. we may not have the resources to pursue all of these objectives simultaneously.
development and completion of new products and services, including without limitation, our interoperable front-to-back servicing platform, may impose additional costs on us, involve dependencies on third parties and may expose us to increased operational and model risk.
our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies, while avoiding increased related expenses. this dependency is exacerbated in the current "fintech" environment, where financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as distributed ledger technology ("blockchain"), and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards. for example, in 2018, we acquired charles river development, and we are leveraging the capabilities we acquired in that transaction to create an interoperable front-to-back office servicing platform combining the offerings within our investment servicing business line. the introduction of new products and services can require significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals and the development and implementation of technical, control and model validation requirements. new products and services, such as an interoperable front-to-back office servicing platform, often also involve dependencies on third parties to, among other things, access innovative technologies, develop new distribution channels or form collaborative product and service offerings, and can require complex strategic alliances and joint venture relationships. substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, strategic alliances and joint ventures including rapid technological change in the industry, our ability to access technical and other information from our clients, the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices, the sharing of benefits in those relationships, conflicts with existing business partners and clients and sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its underlying risks and are compliant with applicable regulations. our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes us to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our clients. failure to successfully manage all of the above risks in the development and implementation of new products or services, including, without limitation, completion of our interoperable front-to-back office servicing platform, could have a material state street corporation | 37
adverse effect on our business and reputation, consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures pose risks for our business.
as part of our business strategy, we acquire complementary businesses and technologies, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and divest portions of our business. we undertake transactions of varying sizes to, among other reasons, expand our geographic footprint, access new clients, technologies or services, develop closer or more collaborative relationships with our business partners, bolster existing servicing capabilities, efficiently deploy capital or leverage cost savings or other business or financial opportunities. we may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions, which could result in increased costs, lowered revenues, ineffective deployment of capital, regulatory concerns, exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation.
transactions of this nature also involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, strategic, managerial, operational, cultural and employment challenges, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. for example, the businesses that we acquire or our strategic alliances or joint ventures may under-perform relative to the price paid or the resources committed by us; we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth or cost savings; or we may otherwise be adversely affected by acquisition-related charges. the intellectual property of an acquired business may be an important component of the value that we agree to pay for such a business. however, such acquisitions are subject to the risks that the acquired business may not own the intellectual property that we believe we are acquiring, that the intellectual property is dependent on licenses from third parties, that the acquired business infringes on the intellectual property rights of others, that the technology does not have the acceptance in the marketplace that we anticipated or that the technology requires significant investment to remain competitive. further, past acquisitions have resulted in the recognition of goodwill and other significant intangible assets in our consolidated statement of condition. for example, we recorded goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $2.46 billion associated with our acquisition of charles river development in 2018. these assets are not eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital under applicable requirements. in addition, we may be required to record impairment in our consolidated statement of income in future periods if we determine that the value of these assets has declined.
through our acquisitions or joint ventures, we may also assume unknown or undisclosed business, operational, tax, regulatory and other liabilities, fail to properly assess known contingent liabilities or assume businesses with internal control deficiencies. while in most of our transactions we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, due diligence, indemnification provisions or insurance, these or other risk-mitigating provisions we put in place may not be sufficient to address these liabilities and contingencies and involve credit and execution risks associated with successfully seeking recourse from a third party, such as the seller or an insurance provider. other major financial services firms have recently paid significant penalties to resolve government investigations into matters conducted in significant part by acquired entities.
various regulatory approvals or consents, formal or informal, are generally required prior to closing of these transactions, which may include approvals or non-objections from the federal reserve and other domestic and non-u.s. regulatory authorities. these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition or require changes to its terms that materially affect the terms of the transaction or our ability to capture some of the opportunities presented by the transaction, or may not approve the transaction. any such conditions, or any associated regulatory delays, could limit the benefits of the transaction. acquisitions or joint ventures we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals, if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied.
the integration and the retention and development of the benefits of our acquisitions results in risks to our business and other uncertainties.
in recent years, we have undertaken several acquisitions, including our 2018 acquisition of charles river development and our 2016 acquisition of the geam business. the integration of acquisitions presents risks that differ from the risks associated with our ongoing operations. integration activities are complicated and time consuming and can involve significant unforeseen costs. we may not be able to effectively assimilate services, technologies, key personnel or businesses of acquired companies into our business or service offerings as anticipated, and we may not achieve related revenue growth or cost savings. we also face the risk of being unable to retain, or cross-sell our products or services to, the clients of acquired companies or joint ventures and the risk of being unable to cross-sell acquired products or services to our existing clients. in particular, some clients, including significant clients, of an acquired business may have the right to transition their business to other providers on short notice for convenience, fiduciary or other reasons and may take the opportunity of the acquisition or market, commercial, relationship, service satisfaction or other developments following the acquisition to terminate, reduce or renegotiate the fees or other terms of our relationship. any such client state street corporation | 38
losses, reductions or renegotiations likely will reduce the expected benefits of the acquisition, including, without limitation, revenues, cross-selling opportunities and market share or cause impairment to goodwill and other intangibles, which effects could be material, and we may not have recourse against the seller of the business or the client. the risk of client loss is even greater where the client is a competitor of ours. acquisitions of technology firms can involve extensive information technology integration, with associated risk of defects, and product enhancement and development activities, the costs of which can be difficult to estimate, as well as heightened cultural and compliance concerns in integrating an unregulated firm into a bank regulatory environment. acquisitions of investment servicing businesses entail information technology systems conversions, which involve operational risks.
with any acquisition, the integration of the operations and resources of the businesses could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our and the acquired company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients or employees, maintain regulatory compliance or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources.
our acquisition of charles river development and the integration of its business, operations and employees with our own may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost synergies of the acquisition may not be fully realized, which could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
we completed our acquisition of charles river development on october 1, 2018. the success of the acquisition, including the achievement of anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies of the acquisition, is subject to a number of uncertainties and will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate charles river development's business into our business in an efficient and effective manner. the combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration, including without limitation, challenges related to:
•   integrating charles river development's business into our own in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost and operating synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;
•   retaining charles river development's clients, some of which are our competitors;
•   retaining key management and technical personnel;
•   integrating charles river development's software solutions with our existing products and services and related operations and systems, including performance, risk and compliance analytics, investment manager operations outsourcing, accounting, administration and custody;
•   accelerating the development of enhancements to the features and functions of charles river development's software solutions;
•   coordinating and integrating our internal operations, compensation programs, policies and procedures, and corporate structures;
•   potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen or increased costs and expenses;
•   the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process;
•   incurring significant acquisition-related costs and expenses associated with combining our operations; and
•   performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention and resources caused by integrating the companies' operations.
any of these factors could result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, on the expected timeline or at all, and could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
cost shifting to non-u.s. jurisdictions and outsourcing may expose us to increased operational risk and reputational harm and may not result in expected cost savings.
we manage expenses by migrating certain business processes and business support functions to lower-cost geographic locations, such as india, poland and china, and by outsourcing to vendors in various jurisdictions and to joint ventures. this effort exposes us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control and effective management or business resiliency within these operations during and after transitions. these migrations also involve risks that our outsourcing vendors or joint ventures may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us, including, without limitation, with respect to indemnification and information security, and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers. our geographic footprint also exposes us to the relevant macroeconomic, political, legal and similar risks generally involved in doing business in the jurisdictions state street corporation | 39
in which we establish lower-cost locations or joint ventures or in which our outsourcing vendors locate their operations. the increased elements of risk that arise from certain operating processes being conducted in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk. during periods of transition of operations, greater operational risk and client concerns exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery and business resiliency. the extent and pace at which we are able to move functions to lower-cost locations, joint ventures and outsourcing providers may also be affected by political, regulatory and client acceptance issues, including with respect to data use, storage and security. such relocation or outsourcing of functions also entails costs, such as technology, real estate and restructuring expenses, which may offset or exceed the expected financial benefits of the relocation or outsourcing. in addition, the financial benefits of lower-cost locations and of outsourcings may diminish over time or could be offset in the event that the u.s. or other jurisdictions impose tax, trade barrier or other measures which seek to discourage the use of lower cost jurisdictions.
the market transition away from broad use of the london interbank offered rate (libor) as an interest rate benchmark may impose additional costs on us and may expose us to increased operational, model and financial risk.
globally, regulators have advised large banks to assess the risks and to prepare for transition from libor to alternative rates ahead of year end 2021. our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to market changes promptly, while avoiding increased related expenses or operational errors. substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the market transition away from the use of libor as a critical interest rate benchmark used to determine amounts payable, under and the value of, financial instruments and contracts.
due to our dependencies on libor, the failure or inability to timely plan and implement a libor transition program to maintain operational continuity and minimize economic impact for our clients, ourselves and other stakeholders could negatively impact our business and financial performance. those dependencies include, without limitation, libor-based securities and loans held in our investment portfolio, libor-based preferred stock and long-term debt issued by us and libor-based client fee schedules and deposit pricing. also, our internal models which support decision making and risk management will require adjustments, which may cause weaknesses in the underlying model, inadequate assumptions or lead to reliance on poor or inaccurate data. assets held by our customers in their investment portfolios or in the investment portfolios we manage for others have libor-based terms. we need to enhance our processes and systems to account for the new alternative rates-based instruments as they come to market, the transition of libor-based instruments to their fallback language and uncertainty as to how such instruments should be valued where such fallback language is unclear. these process and systems requirements could adversely impact our business, which in some instances is dependent on critical inputs from third parties, who themselves must timely adapt to the market changes and failure to implement the terms of those instruments in a manner consistent with customer expectation could lead to disputes and operational issues. failure or perceived failure to adequately prepare for libor transition could affect our ability to attract and retain clients. uncertainty relative to external developments necessary for the market transition away from libor but outside of our control could further increase the costs and risks of the transition for us or our subsidiaries and have an adverse impact on our operational and financial performance.
our calculations of credit, market and operational risk exposures, total rwa and capital ratios for regulatory purposes depend on data inputs, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions that are subject to change over time, which changes, in addition to our consolidated financial results, could materially impact our risk exposures, our total rwa and our capital ratios from period to period.
to calculate our credit, market and operational risk exposures, our total rwa and our capital ratios for regulatory purposes, the basel iii final rule involves the use of current and historical data, including our own loss data and similar information from other industry participants, market volatility measures, interest rates and spreads, asset valuations, credit exposures and the creditworthiness of our counterparties. these calculations also involve the use of quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and significant assumptions. we refer to the data, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions, as well as our related internal processes, as our "advanced systems." while our advanced systems are generally quantitative in nature, significant components involve the exercise of judgment based on, among other factors, our and the financial services industry's evolving experience. any of these judgments or other elements of our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended. collectively, they represent only our estimate of associated risk.
in addition, our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory state street corporation | 40
review and approval. for example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven basel-defined uom, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations. due to the influence of changes in our advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us or more general market, or individual financial institution-specific, activities or experiences, or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our credit, market and operational risk exposures, our total rwa and our capital ratios calculated under the basel iii final rule will change, and may be volatile, over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period.
our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm.
our relationship with many of our clients is predicated on our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. adverse publicity, regulatory actions or fines, litigation, operational failures or the failure to meet client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations could materially and adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain clients or key employees or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses. for example, over the past several years we have experienced adverse publicity with respect to our indirect foreign exchange trading, and this adverse publicity has contributed to a shift of client volume to other foreign exchange execution methods. similarly, governmental actions and reputational issues in our transition management business in the u.k. have adversely affected our revenue from that business and, with criminal convictions or guilty pleas of three of our former employees in 2018 and the deferred prosecution agreement we entered into with the doj in early 2017 and the related sec settlement, these effects have the potential to continue. the client invoicing matter we announced in late 2015 has the potential to result in similar effects. for additional information about these matters, see the risk factor "our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation."
preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems, procedures and controls that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to timely identify, understand and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the marketplaces in which we operate, the regulatory environment and client expectations.
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property, and we are subject to claims of third-party intellectual property rights.
our potential inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology effectively may allow competitors to duplicate our technology and products and may adversely affect our ability to compete with them. to the extent that we do not protect our intellectual property effectively through patents, maintaining trade secrets or other means, other parties, including, without limitation, former employees, with knowledge of our intellectual property may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others' advantage. in addition, we may infringe on claims of third-party patents, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties, including without limitation, clients or service providers with whom we may engage in the development or implementation of other products, , services or solutions or to whose information we may have access for limited permitted purposes but with whom we also compete. the risk of such infringement is enhanced in the current competitive "fintech" environment, particularly with respect to our development of new products and services containing significant technology elements and dependencies, any of which could become the subject of an infringement claim. we may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes. third-party intellectual rights, valid or not, may also impede our deployment of the full scope of our products and service capabilities in all jurisdictions in which we operate or market our products and services.
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate, and operational risks could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
we may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, operational risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, trading risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. we have adopted various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk. while we currently believe that our risk management process is effective, we cannot provide assurance that those controls, procedures, policies and systems will always be adequate to identify and manage internal and external state street corporation | 41
risks, including, without limitation, risks related to service providers, in our various businesses. the risk of individuals, either employees or contractors, engaging in conduct harmful or misleading to clients or to us, such as consciously circumventing established control mechanisms to exceed trading or investment management limitations, committing fraud or improperly selling products or services to clients, is particularly challenging to manage through a control framework. the financial and reputational impact of control or conduct failures can be significant. persistent or repeated issues with respect to controls or individual conduct may raise concerns among regulators regarding our culture, governance and control environment. while we seek to contractually limit our financial exposure to operational risk, the degree of protection that we are able to achieve varies, and our potential exposure may be greater than the revenue we anticipate that we will earn from servicing our clients.
in addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. we may fail to identify or fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets and fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes. if our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, regulatory or industry requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations.
operational risk is inherent in all of our business activities. as a leading provider of services to institutional investors, we provide a broad array of services, including, without limitation, research, investment management, trading services and investment servicing that expose us to operational risk. in addition, these services generate a broad array of complex and specialized servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements, many of which involve the opportunity for human, systems or process errors. we face the risk that the control policies, procedures and systems we have established to comply with our operational requirements will fail, will be inadequate or will become outdated. we also face the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, employee supervision or monitoring mechanisms, service-provider processes or other systems or controls, which could materially affect our future consolidated results of operations. given the volume and magnitude of transactions we process on a daily basis, operational losses represent a potentially significant financial risk for our business. operational errors that result in us remitting funds to a failing or bankrupt entity may be irreversible, and may subject us to losses.
we may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including, without limitation, information processing and financial market settlement functions. in addition, our clients, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. should these events affect us, or the clients, vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected. when we record balance sheet accruals for probable and estimable loss contingencies related to operational losses, we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure, and any accruals we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
the quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors that result in inadequate risk assessments, inaccurate valuations or poor business decisions, and lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could occur, any of which could result in material harm.
we use quantitative models to help manage many different aspects of our businesses. as an input to our overall assessment of capital adequacy, we use models to measure the amount of credit risk, market risk, operational risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk we face. during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we sometimes use models to measure the value of asset and liability positions for which reliable market prices are not available. we also use models to support many different types of business decisions including, without limitation, trading activities, hedging, asset-and-liability management and whether to change business strategy. weaknesses in the underlying model, inadequate model assumptions, normal model limitations, inappropriate model use, weaknesses in model implementation or poor data quality, could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences, including, without limitation, material loss and material non-compliance with regulatory requirements or expectations. because of our widespread usage of models, potential weaknesses in our model risk management practices pose an ongoing risk to us.
we also may fail to accurately quantify the magnitude of the risks we face. our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations. these assumptions may be incorrect, and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant. consequently, the measurements that we make for regulatory purposes may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses. moreover, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. while our risk state street corporation | 42
measures may indicate sufficient capitalization, they may underestimate the level of capital necessary to conduct our businesses.
additionally, our disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective in every circumstance, and, similarly, it is possible we may identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting. any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments or harm our reputation.
we may incur losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the periods incurred.
in the normal course of business, we manage various types of sponsored investment funds through state street global advisors. the services we provide to these sponsored investment funds generate management fee revenue, as well as servicing fees from our other businesses. from time to time, we may invest in the funds, which we refer to as seed capital, in order for the funds to establish a performance history for newly launched strategies. these funds may meet the definition of variable interest entities, as defined by u.s. gaap, and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these funds, we may be required to consolidate these funds in our consolidated financial statements under u.s. gaap. the funds follow specialized investment company accounting rules which prescribe fair value for the underlying investment securities held by the funds.
in the aggregate, we expect any financial losses that we realize over time from these seed investments to be limited to the actual amount invested in the consolidated fund. however, in the event of a fund wind-down, gross gains and losses of the fund may be recognized for financial accounting purposes in different periods during the time the fund is consolidated but not wholly owned. although we expect the actual economic loss to be limited to the amount invested, our losses in any period for financial accounting purposes could exceed the value of our economic interests in the fund and could exceed the value of our initial seed capital investment.
in instances where we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the sponsored investment fund, we do not include the funds in our consolidated financial statements. our risk of loss associated with investment in these unconsolidated funds primarily represents our seed capital investment, which could become realized as a result of poor investment performance. however, the amount of loss we may recognize during any period would be limited to the carrying amount of our investment.
our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our clients incur substantial losses in investment pools in which we act as agent or are restricted in redeeming their interests in these investment pools.
we manage assets on behalf of clients in several forms, including, without limitation, in collective investment pools, money market funds, securities finance collateral pools, cash collateral and other cash products and short-term investment funds. our management of collective investment pools on behalf of clients exposes us to reputational risk and operational losses. if our clients incur substantial investment losses in these pools, receive redemptions as in-kind distributions rather than in cash, or experience significant under-performance relative to the market or our competitors' products, our reputation could be significantly harmed, which harm could significantly and adversely affect the prospects of our associated business units. because we often implement investment and operational decisions and actions over multiple investment pools to achieve scale, we face the risk that losses, even small losses, may have a significant effect in the aggregate.
within our investment management business, we manage investment pools, such as mutual funds and collective investment funds that generally offer our clients the ability to withdraw their investments on short notice, generally daily or monthly. this feature requires that we manage those pools in a manner that takes into account both maximizing the long-term return on the investment pool and retaining sufficient liquidity to meet reasonably anticipated liquidity requirements of our clients. the importance of maintaining liquidity varies by product type, but it is a particularly important feature in money market funds and other products designed to maintain a constant net asset value of $1.00. in the past, we have imposed restrictions on cash redemptions from the agency lending collateral pools, as the per-unit market value of those funds' assets had declined below the constant $1.00 the funds employ to effect purchase and redemption transactions. both the decline of the funds' net asset value below $1.00 and the imposition of restrictions on redemptions had a significant client, reputational and regulatory impact on us, and the recurrence of such or similar circumstances in the future could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. we have also in the past continued to process purchase and redemption of units of investment products designed to maintain a constant net asset value at $1.00 although the fair market value of the fund's assets were less than $1.00. if in the future we were to continue to process purchases and redemptions from such products at $1.00 when the fair market value of our collateral pools' assets is less than $1.00, we could be exposed to significant liability.
state street corporation | 43
if higher than normal demands for liquidity from our clients were to occur, managing the liquidity requirements of our collective investment pools could become more difficult. if such liquidity problems were to recur, our relationships with our clients may be adversely affected, and, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition; levels of redemption activity could increase; and our consolidated results of operations and business prospects could be adversely affected. in addition, if a money market fund that we manage were to have unexpected liquidity demands from investors in the fund that exceeded available liquidity, the fund could be required to sell assets to meet those redemption requirements, and selling the assets held by the fund at a reasonable price, if at all, may then be difficult.
because of the size of the investment pools that we manage, we may not have the financial ability or regulatory authority to support the liquidity or other demands of our clients. any decision by us to provide financial support to an investment pool to support our reputation in circumstances where we are not statutorily or contractually obligated to do so could result in the recognition of significant losses, could adversely affect the regulatory view of our capital levels or plans and could, in some cases, require us to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition. any failure of the pools to meet redemption requests, or under- performance of our pools relative to similar products offered by our competitors, could harm our business and our reputation.
competition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.
our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them, particularly in light of challenges associated with evolving compensation restrictions applicable, or which may become applicable, to banks and some asset managers and that potentially are not applicable to other financial services firms in all jurisdictions or to technology firms, generally. the unexpected loss of services of key personnel in business units, control functions, information technology, operations or other areas could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, their knowledge of our markets, operations and clients, their years of industry experience and, in some cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. similarly, the loss of key employees, either individually or as a group, could adversely affect our clients' perception of our ability to continue to manage certain types of investment management mandates to provide other services to them or to maintain a culture of innovation and proficiency.
we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.
the markets in which we operate across all facets of our business are both highly competitive and global. these markets are changing as a result of new and evolving laws and regulations applicable to financial services institutions. regulatory-driven market changes cannot always be anticipated, and may adversely affect the demand for, and profitability of, the products and services that we offer. in addition, new market entrants and competitors may address changes in the markets more rapidly than we do, or may provide clients with a more attractive offering of products and services, adversely affecting our business. our efforts to develop and market new products, particularly in the "fintech" sector, may position us in new markets with pre-existing competitors with strong market position. we have also experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience, significant pricing pressure in many of our core businesses, particularly our custodial and investment management services. this pricing pressure has and may continue to impact our revenue growth and operational margins and may limit the positive impact of new client demand and growth in auc/a. many of our businesses compete with other domestic and international banks and financial services companies, such as custody banks, investment advisors, broker/dealers, outsourcing companies and data processing companies. further consolidation within the financial services industry could also pose challenges to us in the markets we serve, including, without limitation, potentially increased downward pricing pressure across our businesses.
some of our competitors including, without limitation, our competitors in core services, have substantially greater capital resources than we do or are not subject to as stringent capital or other regulatory requirements as are we. in some of our businesses, we are service providers to significant competitors. these competitors are in some instances significant clients, and the retention of these clients involves additional risks, such as the avoidance of actual or perceived conflicts of interest and the maintenance of high levels of service quality and intra-company confidentiality. the ability of a competitor to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. many of our core services are subject to contracts that have relatively short terms or may be terminated by our client after a short notice period. in addition, pricing pressures as a result of the activities of competitors, client pricing reviews, and rebids, as well as the introduction of new products, may result in a reduction in the prices we can charge for our products and services.
state street corporation | 44
long-term contracts expose us to pricing and performance risk.
we enter into long-term contracts to provide middle office or investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing services to clients, including, without limitation, services related to certain trading activities, cash reporting, settlement and reconciliation activities, collateral management and information technology development. we also may enter into longer-term arrangements with respect to custody, fund administration and depository services. these arrangements generally set forth our fee schedule for the term of the contract and, absent a change in service requirements, do not permit us to re-price the contract for changes in our costs or for market pricing. the long-term contracts for these relationships require, in some cases, considerable up-front investment by us, including, without limitation, technology and conversion costs, and carry the risk that pricing for the products and services we provide might not prove adequate to generate expected operating margins over the term of the contracts.
the profitability of these contracts is largely a function of our ability to accurately calculate pricing for our services, efficiently assume our contractual responsibilities in a timely manner, control our costs and maintain the relationship with the client for an adequate period of time to recover our up-front investment. our estimate of the profitability of these arrangements can be adversely affected by declines in the assets under the clients' management, whether due to general declines in the securities markets or client-specific issues. in addition, the profitability of these arrangements may be based on our ability to cross-sell additional services to these clients, and we may be unable to do so. in addition, such contracts may permit early termination or reduction in services in the event that certain service levels are not met, which termination or service reduction may result in loss of upfront investment in onboarding the client.
performance risk exists in each contract, given our dependence on successful conversion and implementation onto our own operating platforms of the service activities provided. our failure to meet specified service levels or implementation timelines may also adversely affect our revenue from such arrangements, or permit early termination of the contracts by the client. if the demand for these types of services were to decline, we could see our revenue decline.
changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.
new accounting standards, or changes to existing accounting standards, resulting both from initiatives of the fasb as well as changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards, by the fasb or the sec or otherwise reflected in u.s. gaap, potentially could affect our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. these changes can materially affect how we record and report our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and other financial information. in some cases, we could elect, or be required, to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities, and, in some cases, the revision of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. for additional information regarding changes in accounting standards, refer to the "recent accounting developments" section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions, and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our effective tax rate and thus adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.
our businesses can be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation, the expiration of existing tax laws or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide. on december 22, 2017, the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja), generally effective january 2018. this decreased the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax and replaced the existing worldwide tax system with a modified territorial system. the modified territorial system eliminates income tax on foreign dividends and introduces new provisions that generate incremental tax on foreign earnings, base erosion payments and limit the benefit of foreign tax credits.
the u.s. treasury has yet to issue final guidance for key provisions of the tcja, including the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, global intangible low-taxed income and foreign tax credit provisions. depending on how those provisions are ultimately implemented, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected.
u.s. state governments, including massachusetts, and jurisdictions around the world continue to review proposals to amend tax laws, rules and regulations applicable to our businesses that could have a negative impact on our capital or after-tax earnings. in the normal course of our business, we are subject to review by u.s. and non-u.s. tax authorities. a review by any such authority could result in an increase in our recorded tax liability. in addition to the aforementioned risks, our effective tax rate is dependent on the nature and geographic composition of our pre-tax earnings and could be negatively affected by changes in these factors.
state street corporation | 45
we may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events including, without limitation, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the emergence of a pandemic or acts of embezzlement.
acts of terrorism, natural disasters or the emergence of a pandemic could significantly affect our business. we have instituted disaster recovery and continuity plans to address risks from terrorism, natural disasters and pandemic; however, anticipating or addressing all potential contingencies is not possible for events of this nature. acts of terrorism, either targeted or broad in scope, or natural disasters could damage our physical facilities, harm our employees and disrupt our operations. a pandemic, or concern about a possible pandemic, could lead to operational difficulties and impair our ability to manage our business. acts of terrorism, natural disasters and pandemics could also negatively affect our clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as result in disruptions in general economic activity and the financial markets.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of december 31, 2018, we had consolidated total assets of $244.63 billion, consolidated total deposits of $180.36 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity of $24.79 billion and over 40,000 employees. we operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including the u.s., canada, europe, the middle east and asia.
our operations are organized into two lines of business, investment servicing and investment management, which are defined based on products and services provided.
investment servicing provides services for institutional clients, including mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, investment managers, foundations and endowments worldwide. products include: custody; product and participant level accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; our enhanced custody product, which integrates principal securities lending and custody; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors. new products and services resulting from our acquisition of charles river development on october 1, 2018 include: portfolio modeling and construction; trade order management; investment risk and compliance; and wealth management solutions.
investment management, through state street global advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. our investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum, including core and enhanced indexing, multi-asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and alternative investment strategies. our aum is currently primarily weighted to indexed strategies. in addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions, including environmental, social and governance investing, defined benefit and defined contribution and ocio. state street global advisors is also a provider of etfs, including the spdr® etf brand. while management fees are primarily determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees.
for financial and other information about our lines of business, refer to "line of business information" in this management's discussion and analysis and note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
this management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. certain previously reported amounts presented in this form 10-k have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.
the significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:
•   accounting for fair value measurements;
•   impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and
•   contingencies.
these significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision as new information becomes available. additional information about these significant accounting policies is included under "significant accounting estimates" in this management's discussion and analysis.
certain financial information provided in this form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis, is prepared on both a u.s. gaap, or reported basis, and a non-gaap basis, including certain non-gaap measures used in the calculation of identified regulatory ratios. we measure and compare certain financial information on a non-gaap basis, including information (such as capital ratios calculated under regulatory standards scheduled to be effective in the future) that management uses in evaluating our business and activities.
non-gaap financial information should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial information prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap. any non-gaap financial information presented in this form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis, is reconciled state street corporation | 55
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to its most directly comparable currently applicable regulatory ratio or u.s. gaap-basis measure.
we further believe that our presentation of fully taxable-equivalent nii, a non-gaap measure, which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends.
this management's discussion and analysis contains statements that are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of u.s. securities laws. forward-looking statements include statements about our goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, strategies, financial portfolio performance, dividend and stock purchase programs, expected outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures and new technologies, services and opportunities, as well as industry, regulatory, economic and market trends, initiatives and developments, the business environment and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts. these forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. we undertake no obligation to revise the forward-looking statements contained in this management's discussion and analysis to reflect events after the time we file this form 10-k with the sec. additional information about forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is provided in "risk factors" in this form 10-k.
we provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatory standards, including supplemental qualitative and quantitative information with respect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our trading activities) and the liquidity coverage ratio, summary results of semi-annual state street-run stress tests which we conduct under the dodd-frank act and resolution plan disclosures required under the dodd-frank act. these additional disclosures are accessible on the "investor relations" section of our corporate website at www.statestreet.com.
we have included our website address in this report as an inactive textual reference only. information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-k.
we use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and abbreviations, as defined on the acronyms list and glossary in this form 10-k.

nm not meaningful fee revenue table 2: total revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately 78% of the total fee revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
servicing fee revenue generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. we provide a range of services to our clients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration and middle office services, and the nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees. the basis for fees will differ across regions and clients. in general, approximately 55% of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of auc/a; another 15% of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining 30% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values.
changes in market valuations our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels of and the geographic and product mix of our auc/a. increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our auc/a and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients' portfolios.
over the past five years, including the year ended december 31, 2018, we estimate that worldwide market valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (2)% to 5% annually and approximately 2% in 2018. see table 3: daily, month-end and year-end equity indices for selected indices. while the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. in addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.
we estimate, using relevant information as of december 31, 2018 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, that:
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 3%; and
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed income valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 1%.

na not applicable client activity and asset flows client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including fx settlements, equity and derivative trades and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested based on their risk acceptance tolerance. industry trends, such as client redemptions out of hedge funds, can also impact our servicing fee revenues.
over the past five years, including the year ended december 31, 2018, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (1%) to 2% annually and approximately 1% in 2018. see table 4: industry asset flows for selected asset flow information. while the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market trends. in addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

pricing the industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. on average, over the past 5 years, including the year ended december 31, 2018, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients have impacted our servicing fees by approximately (2%) annually, with the impact ranging from (1%) to (4%) in any given year and during the year ended december 31, 2018, the impact was at the higher end of that range. pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the terms of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. the timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by such additional services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services and the nature of those services. these same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net new business over the past five years, including the year ended december 31, 2018, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 2% on average with a range of 1% to 3% annually and approximately 1% in 2018. new business can include: custody; product and participant level accounting; daily valuation and administration; record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance; and other services. revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of assets installed.
management fee revenue management fees generally are affected by changes in month-end valuations of aum. management fees for certain components of managed assets, such as etfs, mutual funds and ucits, are affected by daily average valuations of aum. management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.
asset-based management fees for actively managed products are generally charged at a higher percentage of aum than for passive products. actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account's performance.
in light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of december 31, 2018 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business won and lost and client flows, that:
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 5%; and
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed-income valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 4%.
daily averages, month-end averages and year-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. year-end indices affect the values of aum as of those dates. see table 3: daily, month-end and year-end equity indices for selected indices.
additional information about fee revenue is provided under "line of business information" included in this management's discussion and analysis.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest income see table 2: total revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. nii was $2,671 million for 2018, compared to $2,304 million and $2,084 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
nii is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, resale agreements, loans and leases and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
nim represents the relationship between annualized fully taxable-equivalent nii and average total interest-earning assets for the period. it is calculated by dividing fully taxable-equivalent nii by average interest-earning assets. revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis using the u.s. federal and state statutory income tax rates.
see table 5: average balances and interest rates - fully taxable-equivalent basis, for the breakout of nii on a fte basis for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. nii on a fte basis increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher u.s. interest rates and a continued focus on disciplined liability pricing.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. additional information about the components of interest income and interest expense is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
average total interest-earning assets were $185.64 billion in 2018 compared to $191.24 billion in 2017. the decrease is largely driven by lower client deposits, which includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits and securities sold under repurchase agreements.
interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $54.33 billion in 2018 compared to $47.51 billion in 2017. these deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the federal reserve, the ecb and other non-u.s. central banks.
securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $2.90 billion in 2018 compared to $2.13 billion in 2017. this reflects the impact of balance sheet netting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $36 billion and $31 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively. we maintain an agreement with the fixed income clearing corporation (ficc), a clearing organization that enables us to net all securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization. the increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to the expansion of our program with the ficc and new client activity.
investment securities averaged $88.07 billion in 2018 compared to $95.78 billion in 2017. the decrease in average investment securities was primarily driven by our investment repositioning strategy to prioritize capital efficient client lending while managing oci sensitivity. we sold approximately $26 billion of securities, primarily non-hqla, during 2018, with a significant portion of the proceeds being reinvested in hqla, such as mbs and interest-bearing deposits with banks.
loans and leases averaged $23.57 billion in 2018 compared to $21.92 billion in 2017. the increase in average loans and leases was primarily driven by higher levels of mutual fund lending and commercial real estate loans, as part of our effort to expand our commercial and real estate loan program. loans and leases also includes u.s. and non-u.s. overdrafts, which provide liquidity to clients in support of investment activities.
average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our enhanced custody business, decreased to $15.71 billion in 2018 from $22.88 billion in 2017, primarily driven by a reduction in the level of cash collateral posted. enhanced custody is our securities financing business where we act as principal with respect to our custody clients and generate securities finance revenue. the nii earned on these transactions is generally lower than the interest earned on other alternative investments.
aggregate average u.s. and non-u.s. interest-bearing deposits increased to $125.58 billion in 2018 from $122.56 billion in 2017. the increase was primarily driven by a gradual shift from non-interest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing deposits. future deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client deposit behavior and market conditions, including the general levels of u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates.
average other short-term borrowings, largely associated with our tax-exempt investment program, increased to $1.33 billion in 2018 from $1.31 billion in 2017.
average long-term debt was $10.69 billion in 2018 compared to $11.60 billion in 2017. these amounts reflect issuances and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods, including the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior debt in december 2018.
average other interest-bearing liabilities were $4.96 billion in 2018 compared to $4.61 billion in 2017. other interest-bearing liabilities primarily reflect our level of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our enhanced custody business, which is presented on a net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements.
several factors could affect future levels of nii and nim, including the volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet management activities; changes in the level and slope of u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured and changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend.
based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards, we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated u.s. and non-u.s. securities, such as u.s. treasury and agency securities, sovereign debt securities and federal agency mbs. the pace at which we reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our reinvestment program and future levels of nii and nim.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision for loan losses we recorded a provision for loan losses of $15 million in 2018 compared to $2 million and $10 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the provision increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a higher volume of loans to non-investment grade borrowers composed of senior secured loans that we purchased in connection with our participation in loan syndications in the non-investment grade lending market. additional information about these senior secured loans is provided under "loans and leases" in "financial condition" in this management's discussion and analysis and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.

(1)  charles river development contributed approximately $57 million in total expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018, including approximately $28 million in compensation and employee benefits, $18 million in amortization of other intangible assets and $11 million in other expense lines.
(2) the new revenue recognition standard contributed approximately $272 million in total expenses for 2018, compared to 2017, including approximately $183 million in other expenses, $59 million in transaction processing and $30 million across other expense line items.
nm not meaningful compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 9% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to repositioning charges of $259 million in 2018, or two-thirds of the 9% increase, as described below, as well as annual merit increases, higher investments to support new business and approximately $28 million from charles river development, partially offset by net beacon savings and lower performance based incentive compensation.
compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 1% in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to increased costs to support new business, annual merit and performance based incentive compensation increases, partially offset by net beacon savings. in december 2016, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $249 million ($161 million after tax) associated with an amendment of the terms of outstanding, previously issued, deferred cash-settled incentive compensation awards for certain employees to remove continued service requirements, thereby accelerating the future expense that would have been recognized over the remaining term of the awards had the continued service requirement not been removed.
headcount increased 10% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by growth in our low cost locations and our acquisition of charles river development. headcount in high cost locations fell in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to reductions from beacon, partially offset by increases resulting from the charles river development acquisition.
information systems and communications expenses increased 14% in 2018 compared to 2017, and 6% in 2017 compared to 2016. both increases were primarily related to technology infrastructure enhancements as well as additional investments to support growth, regulatory initiatives and beacon-related investments.
transaction processing services expenses increased 12% in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and higher client volumes. transaction processing services expenses increased 5% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily related to higher client volumes.
occupancy expenses increased 9% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to repositioning charges of approximately $41 million in 2018, partially offset by net beacon savings. occupancy expenses increased 5% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the geam acquisition and higher investments to support new business.
amortization of other intangible assets increased 6% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to contributions from charles river development of approximately $18 million and accelerated amortization associated with a business exit of approximately $16 million. amortization of other intangible assets increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to geam intangible asset amortization.
other expenses increased 27% in 2018, compared to 2017, reflecting the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard which contributed approximately $183 million as well as higher legal and related expenses, partially offset by net beacon savings. other expenses decreased 4% in 2017

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared to 2016, primarily due to lower professional services costs.
as a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. our status as a g-sib has also resulted in heightened prudential and conduct expectations of our u.s. and international regulators with respect to our capital and liquidity management and our compliance and risk oversight programs. these heightened expectations have increased our regulatory compliance costs, including personnel, technology and systems, as well as significant additional implementation and related costs to enhance our regulatory compliance programs. regulatory compliance requirements are anticipated to remain at least at the elevated levels we have experienced over the past several years.
acquisition costs we recorded approximately $31 million of acquisition costs in 2018 related to our acquisition of charles river development on october 1, 2018. in 2017, we recorded approximately $21 million of acquisition costs primarily related to our acquisition of the geam business on july 1, 2016. as we integrate charles river development into our business, we expect to incur a total of approximately $200 million, including the $31 million in 2018, of acquisition costs, including merger and integration costs, through 2021. for further information on our acquisition of charles river development, refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
restructuring and repositioning charges repositioning charges in 2018, we initiated a new expense program to accelerate efforts to become a higher-performing organization and help navigate challenging market and industry conditions. through increased resource discipline, process re-engineering and automation, we expect to realize $350 million in gross expense savings in 2019, consisting primarily of compensation and benefits expenses savings. as part of that program, expenses for 2018 included a repositioning charge of $300 million, including $259 million of compensation and employee benefits and $41 million of occupancy costs.
beacon in 2018, we released $7 million of restructuring accruals related to beacon. in 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $245 million primarily related to beacon. in aggregate, we have recorded restructuring charges of approximately $380 million related to beacon, including $293 million in severance costs and $87 million in real estate actions, information technology application rationalization and other restructuring.

nm not meaningful servicing fees servicing fees increased 1% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to market appreciation and net new business, largely offset by challenging industry conditions, including fee pressure.
servicing fees increased 6% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to market appreciation and net new business, partially offset by continued hedge fund outflows and the impact of the businesses we exited in 2017. servicing fees in 2016 included a revenue reduction of $48 million from reimbursements related to the manner in which we invoiced certain expenses to our clients.
servicing fees generated outside the u.s. were approximately 47% of total servicing fees in 2018 compared to approximately 45% and 42% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

asset servicing mandates newly announced in 2018 totaled approximately $1.9 trillion, which includes a small number of large client mandates announced in the first quarter of 2018. servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $385 billion as of december 31, 2018, which will be reflected in auc/a in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods. the full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized over several quarters as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period.
new asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. these excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from time to time be significant.
with respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including, accounting, bank loan servicing, compliance reporting and monitoring, custody, depository banking services, foreign exchange, fund administration, hedge fund servicing, middle office outsourcing, performance and analytics, private equity administration, real estate administration, securities finance, transfer agency and wealth management services. revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided and the timing of installation, and the types of assets.
for additional information about the impact of worldwide equity and fixed-income valuations on our fee revenue, as well as other key drivers of our servicing fee revenue, refer to "fee revenue" in "consolidated results of operations" included in this management's discussion and analysis.
as a result of a decision to diversify providers, one of our large clients has moved a portion of its assets, largely common trust funds, to another service provider. we remain a significant service provider to this client. the transition, which began in 2018 and is largely complete, represents approximately $1 trillion in assets with respect to which we no longer derive revenue post-transition.
foreign exchange trading services foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in table 8: investment servicing line of business results, increased 7% in 2018 compared to state street corporation | 67
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
2017, primarily due to higher fx client volumes and volatility. foreign exchange trading services is composed of revenue generated by fx trading, as well as revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services. fx trading and brokerage and other trading services represented approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, of our total foreign exchange trading services revenue in both 2018 and 2017.
we primarily earn fx trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker through both "direct sales and trading" and "indirect foreign exchange trading."
•   direct sales and trading: represent fx transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. these principal market-making activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody with us.
•   indirect fx trading: represent fx transactions with clients or their investment managers routed to our fx desk through our asset-servicing operation, and to all of which, we are the funds' custodian. we execute indirect fx trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients.
our fx trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client fx transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our foreign exchange activities. the relative impact of these factors on our total fx trading revenues often differs from period to period. for example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related fx revenue.
our clients that utilize indirect fx trading can, in addition to executing their fx transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect fx trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our "street fx" service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. street fx, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their fx execution strategy and automate the fx trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank.
we also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic fx services" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue."
•   electronic fx services: our clients may choose to execute fx transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms. these transactions generate revenue through a "click" fee.
•   other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: as our clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may choose to utilize our transition or currency management capabilities or transact with our equity trade execution group. these transactions generate revenue via commissions charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.
our transition management revenue has been adversely affected by compliance issues in our u.k. business during 2010 and 2011, including settlements with the u.k. fca in 2014 and the doj and sec in 2017, including a deferred prosecution agreement. the reputational and regulatory impact of those compliance issues continues and may continue to adversely affect our results in future periods.
securities finance our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for state street global advisors managed investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we refer to as the state street global advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer to as our enhanced custody business.
securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our share of the fee split.
as principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. we act as principal when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. in our role as principal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. while we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower.
state street corporation | 68
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations securities finance revenue, as presented in table 8: investment servicing line of business results, decreased 10% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to certain balance sheet repositioning efforts within our enhanced custody business. securities finance revenue increased 8% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of higher revenue in our enhanced custody business.
market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods. in addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards, interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance, equity income from our joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of other assets and amortization of our tax-advantaged investments.
processing fees and other revenue, presented in table 8: investment servicing line of business results, increased 23% in 2018 compared to 2017, and reflects approximately $116 million from charles river development in 2018.
processing fees and other revenue increased 102% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to pre-tax gains in 2017 from the disposition of certain joint venture interests and the sale of an equity trading platform.
expenses total expenses for investment servicing increased 5% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher technology costs, higher investments to support new business, annual merit increases and $57 million of expenses from charles river development, partially offset by net beacon savings and lower performance based incentive compensation.
additional information about expenses is provided under "expenses" in "consolidated results of operations" included in this management's discussion and analysis.

the preceding table does not include approximately $37 billion of new asset management business which was awarded but not installed as of december 31, 2018. new business will be reflected in aum in future periods after installation, and will generate management fee revenue in subsequent periods. total aum as of december 31, 2018 included managed assets lost but not liquidated. lost business occurs from time to time and it is difficult to predict the timing of client behavior in transitioning these assets as the timing can vary significantly.
expenses total expenses for investment management increased 20% in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting the impact from the new revenue recognition standard which contributed approximately $248 million to investment management expenses in 2018.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our investment servicing and investment management lines of business. our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. as our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. these liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment alternatives for our clients.
deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. our assets consist primarily of securities held in our afs or htm portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

(1) primarily comprised of securities guaranteed by the federal government with respect to at least 97% of defaulted principal and accrued interest on the underlying loans.
(2) as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k, upon adoption of asu 2016-01 in 2018, we reclassified money-market funds and equity securities classified as afs to held at fair value through profit and loss in other assets.
(3) includes securities at amortized cost or fair value on the date of transfer from afs.
additional information about our investment securities portfolio is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
we manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in the context of the overall structure of our consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of the global interest rate environment. we consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated statement of condition.
average duration of our investment securities portfolio increased to 3.1 years as of december 31, 2018, compared to 2.7 years as of december 31, 2017. the increase in securities duration reflects a shift towards a strategy where the investment portfolio will target less credit exposure and more hqla interest rate exposure.
in 2018, $1.2 billion of htm securities, primarily consisting of mbs and cmbs, were transferred to afs at book value and sold at a pre-tax loss of approximately $36 million, due to our election to make a one-time transfer of securities in connection with the adoption of asu 2017-12. for additional information on this new standard, refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
in 2018, we sold approximately $26 billion of non-hqla securities, primarily abs and municipal bonds, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of approximately $9 million. a significant portion of the sales have been reinvested in hqla and such investments will continue to occur over time with a portion likely to either be held in cash or cash equivalents or used to fund client lending activities.
in 2017, we sold $12.2 billion of afs securities, primarily agency mbs and u.s. treasury securities in our investment portfolio, to position for the then existing interest rate environment resulting in a pre-tax loss of $39 million.
in 2018 and 2017, $2.1 billion and $496 million, respectively, of agency mbs, previously classified as afs, were transferred to htm. this transfer reflects our intent to hold these securities until their maturity. these securities were transferred at fair value, which included a net unrealized loss of $53 million and $2.8 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, within accumulated other comprehensive loss which will be accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the transferred security (ranging from approximately 10 to 42 years).
approximately 90% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated "aaa" or "aa" as of both december 31, 2018 and 2017.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impairment impairment exists when the fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis. impairment of a security is further assessed to determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. for afs and htm debt securities, we record impairment in our consolidated statement of income when management intends to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recover in value, or when management expects the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the securities to be less than the amortized cost of the impaired security (a credit loss).
we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether otti exists. our assessment of otti involves an evaluation of economic and security-specific factors. such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. to the extent that market conditions are worse than management's expectations or due to idiosyncratic bond performance, otti could increase, in particular the credit-related component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income. additional information with respect to otti, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
our evaluation of potential otti of structured credit securities with collateral in the u.k. and continental europe takes into account the outcome from the brexit referendum and other geopolitical events, and assumes no disruption of payments on these securities.

(1) we wound down our lease financing business in 2018.
total loans and leases as of december 31, 2018 increased compared to december 31, 2017, primarily due to the expansion of the commercial real estate loan portfolio and increase in non-u.s. commercial and financial loans.
as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, our investment in senior secured loans totaled approximately $4.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. in addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 of $238 million and $279 million, respectively, to participate in such syndications. additional information about these unfunded commitments is provided in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
these senior secured loans, which are primarily rated "speculative" under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k), are externally rated "bbb," "bb" or "b," with approximately 90% and 89% of the loans rated "bb" or "b" as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively. our investment strategy involves generally limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment. however, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in our portfolio.
loans to municipalities included in the commercial and financial segment were $0.9 billion and $2.1 billion as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively.
additional information about all of our loan and leases segments, as well as underlying classes, is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
no loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017.

(1) the provision for loan and lease losses is primarily related to commercial and financial loans.
we recorded a provision for loan losses of $15 million in 2018 compared to $2 million and $10 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the provision increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to a higher volume of loans to non-investment grade borrowers composed of senior secured loans that we purchased in connection with our participation in loan syndications in the non-investment grade lending market. the charge-offs of $2 million recorded in 2018 were associated with loan sales of senior secured loans to non-investment grade institutional borrowers.
as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, approximately $60 million and $47 million, respectively, of our allowance for loan and lease losses was related to senior secured loans included in the commercial and financial segment. as this portfolio grows and matures, our allowance for loan and lease losses related to these loans may increase through additional provisions for credit losses.
cross-border outstandings cross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by non-u.s. counterparties which are denominated in u.s. dollars or other non-local currency, as well as non-u.s. local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities. our cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease financing, including short-duration advances; investment securities; amounts related to foreign exchange and interest rate contracts; and securities finance.  in addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations.
as market and economic conditions change, the major independent credit rating agencies may downgrade u.s. and non-u.s. financial institutions and sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and may do so again in the future. as a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility.
the cross-border outstandings presented in table 28: cross-border outstandings, represented approximately 28%, 26% and 28% of our consolidated total assets as of december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management general in the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others more specific to our business activities. our risk management framework focuses on material risks, which include the following:
•   credit and counterparty risk;
•   liquidity risk, funding and management;
•   operational risk;
•   information technology risk;
•   market risk associated with our trading activities;
•   market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer to as asset-and-liability management, and which consists primarily of interest rate risk;
•   strategic risk;
•   model risk; and
•   reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
many of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each of these risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, are discussed in detail under "risk factors" in this form 10-k.
the scope of our business requires that we balance these risks with a comprehensive and well-integrated risk management function. the identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of risks are essential to our financial performance and successful management of our businesses. these risks, if not effectively managed, can result in losses to us as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. our approach, including board and senior management oversight and a system of policies, procedures, limits, risk measurement and monitoring and internal controls, allows for an assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return.
our objective is to optimize our return while operating at a prudent level of risk. in support of this objective, we have instituted a risk appetite framework that aligns our business strategy and financial objectives with the level of risk that we are willing to incur.
our risk management is based on the following major goals:
•   a culture of risk awareness that extends across all of our business activities;
•   the identification, classification and quantification of our material risks;
•   the establishment of our risk appetite and associated limits and policies, and our compliance with these limits;
•   the establishment of a risk management structure at the "top of the house" that enables the control and coordination of risk-taking across the business lines;
•   the implementation of stress testing practices and a dynamic risk-assessment capability;
•   a direct link between risk and strategic-decision making processes and incentive compensation practices; and
•   the overall flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing business and market conditions.
our risk appetite framework outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define our risk appetite, as well as the responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits, and for reporting, escalating, approving and addressing exceptions. our risk appetite framework is established by erm, a corporate risk oversight group, in conjunction with the mrac and the rc of the board. the board formally reviews and approves our risk appetite statement annually, or more frequently as required.
the risk appetite framework describes the level and types of risk that we are willing to accommodate in executing our business strategy, and also serves as a guide in setting risk limits across our business units. in addition to our risk appetite framework, we use stress testing as another important tool in our risk management practice. additional information with respect to our stress testing process and practices is provided under "capital" in this management's discussion and analysis.
disclosures about our management of significant risks can be found on the following pages in this management's discussion and analysis.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations governance and structure we have an approach to risk management that involves all levels of management, from the board and its committees, including its e&a committee, rc, the ecc and tops, to each business unit and each employee. we allocate responsibility for risk oversight so that risk/return decisions are made at an appropriate level, and are subject to robust and effective review and challenge. risk management is the responsibility of each employee, and is implemented through three lines of defense: the business units, which own and manage the risks inherent in their business, are considered the first line of defense; erm and other support functions, such as compliance, finance and vendor management, provide the second line of defense; and corporate audit, which assesses the effectiveness of the first two lines of defense.
the responsibilities for effective review and challenge reside with senior managers, management oversight committees, corporate audit and, ultimately, the board and its committees. while we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, internal and external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated.
corporate-level risk committees provide focused oversight, and establish corporate standards and policies for specific risks, including credit, sovereign exposure, market, liquidity, operational, information technology as well as new business products, regulatory compliance and ethics, vendor risk and model risks. these committees have been delegated the responsibility to develop recommendations and remediation strategies to address issues that affect or have the potential to affect us.
we maintain a risk governance committee structure which serves as the formal governance mechanism through which we seek to undertake the consistent identification, management and mitigation of various risks facing us in connection with its business activities. this governance structure is enhanced and integrated through multi-disciplinary involvement, particularly through erm. the following chart presents this structure.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations enterprise risk management the goal of erm is to ensure that risks are proactively identified, well-understood and prudently managed in support of our business strategy. erm provides risk oversight, support and coordination to allow for the consistent identification, measurement and management of risks across business units separate from the business units' activities, and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of corporate-wide risk management policies and guidelines. in addition, erm establishes and reviews limits and, in collaboration with business unit management, monitors key risks. ultimately, erm works to validate that risk-taking occurs within the risk appetite statement approved by the board and conforms to associated risk policies, limits and guidelines.
the cro is responsible for our risk management globally, leads erm and has a dual reporting line to our ceo and the board's rc. erm manages its responsibilities globally through a three-dimensional organization structure:
•   "vertical" business unit-aligned risk groups that support business managers with risk management, measurement and monitoring activities;
•   "horizontal" risk groups that monitor the risks that cross all of our business units (for example, credit and operational risk); and
•   risk oversight for international activities, which combines intersecting "verticals" and "horizontals" through a hub and spoke model to provide important regional and legal entity perspectives to the global risk framework.
sitting on top of this three-dimensional organization structure is a centralized group responsible for the aggregation of risk exposures across the vertical, horizontal and regional dimensions, for consolidated reporting, for setting the corporate-level risk appetite framework and associated limits and policies, and for dynamic risk assessment across our business.
board committees the board has four committees which assist it in discharging its responsibilities with respect to risk management: the rc, the e&a committee, the ecc and the tops.
the rc is responsible for oversight related to the operation of our global risk management framework, including policies and procedures establishing risk management governance and processes and risk control infrastructure for our global operations. the rc is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our assessment and management of all risks applicable to our operations, including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, regulatory and business risks, as well as compliance and reputational risk and related policies.
in addition, the rc provides oversight of capital policies and capital planning, resolution planning and monitors capital adequacy in relation to risk. the rc is also responsible for discharging the duties and obligations of the board under applicable basel and other regulatory requirements.
the e&a committee oversees management's operation of our comprehensive system of internal controls covering the integrity of our consolidated financial statements and reports, compliance with laws, regulations and corporate policies. the e&a committee acts on behalf of the board in monitoring and overseeing the performance of corporate audit and in reviewing certain communications with banking regulators. the e&a committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention, evaluation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, including sole authority for the establishment of pre-approval policies and procedures for all audit engagements and any non-audit engagements.
the ecc has direct responsibility for the oversight of all compensation plans, policies and programs in which executive officers participate and incentive, retirement, welfare as well as equity plans in which certain of our other employees participate. in addition, the ecc oversees the alignment of our incentive compensation arrangements with our safety and soundness, including the integration of risk management objectives, and related policies, arrangements and control processes consistent with applicable related regulatory rules and guidance.
the tops leads and assists in the board's oversight of technology and operational risk management and the role of these risks in executing our strategy and supporting our global business requirements. the tops reviews strategic initiatives from a technology and operational risk perspective and reviews and approves technology-related risk matters.
executive management committees mrac is the senior management decision-making body for risk and capital issues, and oversees our financial risks, our consolidated statement of condition, and our capital adequacy, liquidity and recovery and resolution planning. its responsibilities include:
•   the approval of the policies of our global risk, capital and liquidity management frameworks, including our risk appetite framework;
•   the monitoring and assessment of our capital adequacy based on internal policies and regulatory requirements;
state street corporation | 81
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   the oversight of our firm-wide risk identification, model risk governance, stress testing and recovery and resolution plan programs; and
•   the ongoing monitoring and review of risks undertaken within the businesses, and our senior management oversight and approval of risk strategies and tactics.
mrac, is co-chaired by our cro and cfo, who regularly present to the rc on developments in the risk environment and performance trends in our key business areas.
bcrc provides additional risk governance and leadership, by overseeing our business practices in terms of our compliance with laws, regulations and our standards of business conduct, our commitments to clients and others with whom we do business, and potential reputational risks. management considers adherence to high ethical standards to be critical to the success of our business and to our reputation. the bcrc is co-chaired by our cco and our chief legal officer.
torc oversees and assesses the effectiveness of corporate-wide technology and operational risk management programs, to manage and control technology and operational risk consistently across the organization. torc is co-chaired by the cao and the chief risk officer.
risk committees the following risk committees, under the oversight of the respective executive management committees, have focused responsibilities for oversight of specific areas of risk management:

credit risk management core policies and principles we define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms. we assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as principal securities lending and foreign exchange and indemnified agency securities lending. we also assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions.
we distinguish between three major types of credit risk:
•   default risk - the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual payment obligations;
•   country risk - the risk that we may suffer a loss, in any given country, due to any of the following reasons: deterioration of economic conditions, political and social upheaval, nationalization and appropriation of assets, government repudiation of indebtedness, exchange controls and disruptive currency depreciation or devaluation; and
•   settlement risk - the risk that the settlement or clearance of transactions will fail, which arises whenever the exchange of cash, securities and/or other assets is not simultaneous.
the acceptance of credit risk by us is governed by corporate policies and guidelines, which include standardized procedures applied across the entire organization. these policies and guidelines include specific requirements related to each counterparty's state street corporation | 83
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk profile; the markets served; counterparty, industry and country concentrations; and regulatory compliance. these policies and procedures also implement a number of core principles, which include the following:
•   we measure and consolidate credit risks to each counterparty, or group of counterparties, in accordance with a "one-obligor" principle that aggregates risks across our business units;
•   erm reviews and approves all extensions of credit, or material changes to extensions of credit (such as changes in term, collateral structure or covenants), in accordance with assigned credit-approval authorities;
•   credit-approval authorities are assigned to individuals according to their qualifications, experience and training, and these authorities are periodically reviewed. our largest exposures require approval by the credit committee, a sub-committee of the crpc. with respect to small and low-risk extensions of credit to certain types of counterparties, approval authority is granted to individuals outside of erm;
•   we seek to avoid or limit undue concentrations of risk. counterparty (or groups of counterparties), industry, country and product-specific concentrations of risk are subject to frequent review and approval in accordance with our risk appetite;
•   we determine the creditworthiness of counterparties through a risk assessment, including the use of internal risk-rating methodologies;
•   we seek to review all extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of counterparties at least annually. the nature and extent of these reviews are determined by the size, nature and term of the extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and
•   we subject all corporate policies and guidelines to annual review as an integral part of our periodic assessment of our risk appetite.
our corporate policies and guidelines require that the business units which engage in activities that give rise to credit and counterparty risk comply with procedures that promote the extension of credit for legitimate business purposes; are consistent with the maintenance of proper credit standards; limit credit-related losses; and are consistent with our goal of maintaining a strong financial condition.
structure and organization the credit risk group within erm is responsible for the assessment, approval and monitoring of credit risk across our business. the group is managed centrally, has dedicated teams in a number of locations worldwide across our businesses, and is responsible for related policies and procedures, and for our internal credit-rating systems and methodologies. in addition, the group, in conjunction with the business units, establishes measurements and limits to control the amount of credit risk accepted across its various business activities, both at the portfolio level and for each individual counterparty or group of counterparties, to individual industries, and also to counterparties by product and country of risk. these measurements and limits are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.
in conjunction with other groups in erm, the credit risk group is jointly responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of our credit risk measurement and management systems, including data and assessment systems, quantification systems and the reporting framework.
various key committees are responsible for the oversight of credit risk and associated credit risk policies, systems and models. all credit-related activities are governed by our risk appetite framework and our credit risk guidelines, which define our general philosophy with respect to credit risk and the manner in which we control, manage and monitor such risks.
the previously described crpc (refer to "risk committees") has primary responsibility for the oversight, review and approval of the credit risk guidelines and policies. credit risk guidelines and policies are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.
the credit committee, a sub-committee of the crpc, has responsibility for assigning credit authority and approving the largest and higher-risk extensions of credit to individual counterparties or groups of counterparties.
crpc provides periodic updates to mrac and the board's rc.
credit ratings we perform initial and ongoing reviews to exercise due diligence on the creditworthiness of our counterparties when conducting any business with them or approving any credit limits.
this due diligence process generally includes the assignment of an internal credit rating, which is determined by the use of internally developed and validated methodologies, scorecards and a 15-grade rating scale. this risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment; qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a replicable manner and, following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our rating scale is assigned. credit ratings are reviewed and approved by the credit risk group or designees within erm. to facilitate comparability state street corporation | 84
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations across the portfolio, counterparties within a given sector are rated using a risk-rating tool developed for that sector.
our risk-rating methodologies are approved by the crpc, after completion of internal model validation processes, and are subject to an annual review, including re-validation.
we generally rate our counterparties individually, although accounts defined by us as low-risk are rated on a pooled basis. we evaluate and rate the credit risk of our counterparties on an ongoing basis.
risk parameter estimates our internal risk-rating system seeks to promote a clear and consistent approach to the determination of appropriate credit risk classifications for our credit counterparties and exposures, tracking the changes in risk associated with these counterparties and exposures over time. this capability enhances our ability to more accurately calculate both risk exposures and capital, enabling better strategic decision making across the organization.
we use credit risk parameter estimates for the following purposes:
•   the assessment of the creditworthiness of new counterparties and, in conjunction with our risk appetite statement, the development of appropriate credit limits for our products and services, including loans, foreign exchange, securities finance, placements and repurchase agreements;
•   the use of an automated process for limit approvals for certain low-risk counterparties, as defined in our credit risk guidelines, based on the counterparty's probability-of-default, or pd, rating class;
•   the development of approval authority matrices based on pd; riskier counterparties with higher ratings require higher levels of approval for a comparable pd and limit size compared to less risky counterparties with lower ratings;
•   the analysis of risk concentration trends using historical pd and exposure-at-default, or ead, data;
•   the standardization of rating integrity testing by gcr using rating parameters;
•   the determination of the level of management review of short-duration advances depending on pd; riskier counterparties with higher rating class values generally trigger higher levels of management escalation for comparable short-duration advances compared to less risky counterparties with lower rating-class values;
•   the monitoring of credit facility utilization levels using ead values and the identification of instances where counterparties have exceeded limits;
•   the aggregation and comparison of counterparty exposures with risk appetite levels to determine if businesses are maintaining appropriate risk levels; and
•   the determination of our regulatory capital requirements for the airb provided in the basel framework.
credit risk mitigation we seek to limit our credit exposure and reduce our potential credit losses through various types of risk mitigation. in our day-to-day management of credit risks, we utilize and recognize the following types of risk mitigation.
collateral in many parts of our business, we regularly require or agree for collateral to be received from or provided to clients and counterparties in connection with contracts that incur credit risk. in our trading businesses, this collateral is typically in the form of cash and highly-rated securities (government securities and other bonds or equity securities). credit risks in our non-trading and securities finance businesses are also often secured by bonds and equity securities and by other types of assets. collateral serves to reduce the risk of loss inherent in an exposure by improving the prospect of recovery in the event of a counterparty default. however, rapidly changing market values of the collateral we hold, unexpected increases in the credit exposure to a client or counterparty, reductions in the value or change in the type of securities held by us, as well as operational errors or errors in the manner in which we seek to exercise our rights, may reduce the risk mitigation effects of collateral or result in other security interests not being effective to reduce potential credit exposure. while collateral is often an alternative source of repayment, it generally does not replace the requirement within our policies and guidelines for high-quality underwriting standards. we also may choose to incur credit exposure without the benefit of collateral or other risk mitigating credits rights.
our credit risk guidelines require that the collateral we accept for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality, can be reliably valued and can be liquidated if or when required. generally, when collateral is of lower quality, more difficult to value or more challenging to liquidate, higher discounts to market values are applied for the purposes of measuring credit risk. for certain less liquid collateral, longer liquidation periods are assumed when determining the credit exposure.
all types of collateral are assessed regularly by erm, as is the basis on which the collateral is valued.
state street corporation | 85
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our assessment of collateral, including the ability to liquidate collateral in the event of a counterparty default, and also with regard to market values of collateral under a variety of hypothetical market conditions, is an integral component of our assessment of risk and approval of credit limits. we also seek to identify, limit and monitor instances of "wrong-way" risk, where a counterparty's risk of default is positively correlated with the risk of our collateral eroding in value.
we maintain policies and procedures requiring that documentation used to collateralize a transaction is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions. we also conduct legal reviews to assess whether our documentation meets these standards on an ongoing basis.
netting netting is a mechanism that allows institutions and counterparties to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another through the use of qualifying master netting agreements. a master netting agreement allows the netting of rights and obligations arising under derivative or other transactions that have been entered into under such an agreement upon the counterparty's default, resulting in a single net claim owed by, or to, the counterparty. this is commonly referred to as "close-out netting," and is pursued wherever possible. we may also enter into master agreements that allow for the netting of amounts payable on a given day and in the same currency, reducing our settlement risk. this is commonly referred to as "payment netting," and is widely used in our foreign exchange activities.
as with collateral, we have policies and procedures in place to apply close-out and payment netting only to the extent that we have verified legal validity and enforceability of the master agreement. in the case of payment netting, operational constraints may preclude us from reducing settlement risk, notwithstanding the legal right to require the same under the master netting agreement. in the event we become unable, due to operational constraints, actions by regulators, changes in accounting principles, law or regulation (or related interpretations) or other factors, to net some or all of our offsetting exposures and payment obligations under those agreements, we would be required to gross up our assets and liabilities on our statement of condition and our calculation of rwa, accordingly.  this would result in a potentially material increase in our regulatory ratios, including lcr, and present increased credit, liquidity, asset-and-liability management and operational risks, some of which could be material.
guarantees a guarantee is a financial instrument that results in credit support being provided by a third party, (i.e., the protection provider) to the underlying obligor (the beneficiary of the provided protection) on account of an exposure owing by the obligor. the protection provider may support the underlying exposure either in whole or in part. support of this kind may take different forms. typical forms of guarantees provided to us include financial guarantees, letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, purchase undertaking agreements contracts and insurance.
we have established a review process to evaluate guarantees under the applicable requirements of our policies and basel iii requirements. governance for this evaluation is covered under policies and procedures that require regular reviews of documentation, jurisdictions and credit quality of protection providers.
pursuant to the basel iii final rule, we are permitted to reflect the application of credit risk mitigation which may include, for example, guarantees, collateral, netting, secured interests in non-financial assets and credit default swaps. we do not actively use credit default swaps as a risk mitigation tool, although it increasingly applies the recognition of guarantees, collateral and security over non-financial assets to mitigate overall risk within its counterparty credit portfolio.
credit limits central to our philosophy for our management of credit risk is the approval and imposition of credit limits, against which we monitor the actual and potential future credit exposure arising from our business activities with counterparties or groups of counterparties. credit limits are a reflection of our risk appetite, which may be determined by the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the nature of the risk inherent in the business undertaken with the counterparty, or a combination of relevant credit factors. our risk appetite for certain sectors and certain countries and geographic regions may also influence the level of risk we are willing to assume to certain counterparties.
the analysis and approval of credit limits is undertaken in a consistent manner across our businesses, although the nature and extent of the analysis may vary, based on the type, term and magnitude of the risk being assumed. credit limits and underlying exposures are assessed and measured on both a gross and net basis where appropriate, with net exposure determined by deducting the value of any collateral held. for certain types of risk being assumed, we will also assess and measure exposures under a variety of hypothetical market conditions. credit limit approvals across our business are undertaken by the credit risk group, by individuals to whom credit authority has been delegated, or by the credit committee.
credit limits are re-evaluated annually, or more frequently as needed, and are revised periodically on prevailing and anticipated market conditions, changes state street corporation | 86
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in counterparty or country-specific credit ratings and outlook, changes in our risk appetite for certain counterparties, sectors or countries, and enhancements to the measurement of credit utilization.
reporting ongoing active monitoring and management of our credit risk is an integral part of our credit risk management framework. we maintain management information systems to identify, measure, monitor and report credit risk across businesses and legal entities, enabling erm and our businesses to have timely access to accurate information on credit limits and exposures. monitoring is performed along the dimensions of counterparty, industry, country and product-specific risks to facilitate the identification of concentrations of risk and emerging trends.
key aspects of this credit risk reporting structure include governance and oversight groups, policies that define standards for the reporting of credit risk, data aggregation and sourcing systems and separate testing of relevant risk reporting functions by corporate audit.
the credit portfolio management group routinely assesses the composition of our overall credit risk portfolio for alignment with our stated risk appetite. this assessment includes routine analysis and reporting of the portfolio, monitoring of market-based indicators, the assessment of industry trends and developments and regular reviews of concentrated risks. the credit portfolio management group is also responsible, in conjunction with the business units, for defining the appetite for credit risk in the major sectors in which we have a concentration of business activities. these sector-level risk appetite statements, which include counterparty selection criteria and granular underwriting guidelines, are reviewed periodically and approved by the crpc.
monitoring regular surveillance of credit and counterparty risks is undertaken by our business units, the credit risk group and designees with erm, allowing for frequent and extensive oversight. this surveillance process includes, but is not limited to, the following components:
•   annual reviews. a formal review of counterparties is conducted at least annually and includes a thorough review of operating performance, primary risk factors and our internal credit risk rating. this annual review also includes a review of current and proposed credit limits, an assessment of our ongoing risk appetite and verification that supporting legal documentation remains effective.
•   interim monitoring. periodic monitoring of our largest and riskiest counterparties is undertaken more frequently, utilizing financial information, market indicators and other relevant credit and performance measures. the nature and extent of this interim monitoring is individually tailored to certain counterparties and/or industry sectors to identify material changes to the risk profile of a counterparty (or group of counterparties) and assign an updated internal risk rating in a timely manner.
we maintain an active "watch list" for all counterparties where we have identified a concern that the actual or potential risk of default has increased. the watch list status denotes a concern with some aspect of a counterparty's risk profile that warrants closer monitoring of the counterparty's financial performance and related risk factors. our ongoing monitoring processes are designed to facilitate the early identification of counterparties whose creditworthiness is deteriorating; any counterparty may be placed on the watch list by erm at its sole discretion.
counterparties that receive an internal risk rating within a certain range on our rating scale are eligible for watch list designation. these risk ratings generally correspond with the non-investment grade or near non-investment grade ratings established by the major independent credit-rating agencies, and also include the regulatory classifications of "special mention," "substandard," "doubtful" and "loss." counterparties whose internal ratings are outside this range may also be placed on the watch list.
the credit risk group maintains primary responsibility for our watch list processes, and generates a monthly report of all watch list counterparties. the watch list is formally reviewed at least on a quarterly basis, with participation from senior erm staff, and representatives from the business units and our corporate finance and legal groups as appropriate. these meetings include a review of individual watch list counterparties, together with credit limits and prevailing exposures, and are focused on actions to contain, reduce or eliminate the risk of loss to us. identified actions are documented and monitored.
controls gcr provides a separate level of surveillance and oversight over the integrity of our credit risk management processes, including the internal risk-rating system. gcr reviews counterparty credit ratings for all identified sectors on an ongoing basis. gcr is subject to oversight by the crpc, and provides periodic updates to the board's rc.
specific activities of gcr include the following:
•   separate and objective assessments of our credit and counterparty exposures to determine the nature and extent of risk undertaken by the business units;
state street corporation | 87
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   periodic credit process and credit product reviews, focusing on and assessing credit analysis, policy compliance, prudent transaction structure and underwriting standards, administration and documentation, risk-rating integrity and relevant trends;
•   identification and monitoring of developing counterparty, market and/or industry sector trends to limit risk of loss and protect capital;
•   regular and formal reporting of reviews, including findings and requisite actions to remedy identified deficiencies;
•   allocation of resources for specialized risk assessments (on an as-needed basis);
•   assessment of the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses and otti; and
•   liaison with auditors and regulatory personnel on matters relating to risk rating, reporting and measurement.
reserve for credit losses we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to support our on-balance sheet credit exposures. we also maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our off-balance credit exposure. the two components together represent the reserve for credit losses. review and evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio, the volume of adversely classified loans, previous loss experience, current trends, and economic conditions and their effect on our counterparties. additional information about the allowance for loan and lease losses is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
liquidity risk management our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. in managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. this process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
we manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis. we also manage liquidity on a stand-alone basis at our parent company, as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of state street bank. state street bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market and the federal reserve's discount window. the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. additionally, the parent company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily through ssif (a direct subsidiary of the parent company), as discussed in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k, enough cash to meet its current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one-year period. absent financial distress at the parent company, the liquid assets available at ssif continue to be available to the parent company. as of december 31, 2018, the value of our parent company's net liquid assets totaled $486 million, compared with $532 million as of december 31, 2017, which amount does not include available liquidity through ssif. as of december 31, 2018, our parent company and state street bank have no senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
as a sifi, our liquidity risk management activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including interpretations of those requirements, under specific u.s. and international regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance, supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and other regulatory interactions. satisfaction of these requirements could, in some cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced nii or nim, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products and services. if we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. our efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
governance global treasury is responsible for our management of liquidity. this includes the day-to-day management of our global liquidity position, the development and monitoring of early warning indicators, key liquidity risk metrics, the creation and execution of stress tests, the evaluation and implementation of regulatory requirements, the maintenance and execution of our liquidity guidelines and contingency funding plan, and routine management reporting to alco, mrac and the board's rc.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations treasury risk management reports to the cro. global treasury risk management's responsibilities relative to liquidity risk management include the development and review of policies and guidelines; the monitoring of limits related to adherence to the liquidity risk guidelines and associated reporting.
liquidity framework our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. in managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators, and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. this process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
we manage liquidity according to several principles that are equally important to our overall liquidity risk management framework:
•   structural liquidity management addresses liquidity by monitoring and directing the composition of our consolidated statement of condition. structural liquidity is measured by metrics such as the percentage of total wholesale funds to consolidated total assets, and the percentage of non-government investment securities to client deposits. in addition, on a regular basis and as described below, our structural liquidity is evaluated under various stress scenarios.
•   tactical liquidity management addresses our day-to-day funding requirements and is largely driven by changes in our primary source of funding, which are client deposits. fluctuations in client deposits may be supplemented with short-term borrowings, which generally include commercial paper, repurchase agreements, fhlb products and certificates of deposit.
•   stress testing and contingent funding planning are longer-term strategic liquidity risk management practices. regular and ad hoc liquidity stress testing are performed under various severe but plausible scenarios at the consolidated level and at significant subsidiaries, including state street bank. these tests contemplate severe market and events specific to us under various time horizons and severities. tests contemplate the impact of material changes in key funding sources, credit ratings, additional collateral requirements, contingent uses of funding, systemic shocks to the financial markets and operational failures based on market and assumptions specific to us. the stress tests evaluate the required level of funding versus available sources in an adverse environment. as stress testing contemplates potential forward-looking scenarios, results also serve as a trigger to activate specific liquidity stress levels and contingent funding actions.
cfps are designed to assist senior management with decision-making associated with any contingency funding response to a possible or actual crisis scenario. the cfps define roles, responsibilities and management actions to be taken in the event of deterioration of our liquidity profile caused by either an event specific to us or a broader disruption in the capital markets. specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions.
liquidity risk metrics in managing our liquidity, we employ early warning indicators and metrics. early warning indicators are intended to detect situations which may result in a liquidity stress, including changes in our common stock price and the spread on our long-term debt. additional metrics that are critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and monitored as part of our routine liquidity management include measures of our fungible cash position, purchased wholesale funds, unencumbered liquid assets, deposits and the total of investment securities and loans as a percentage of total client deposits.
asset liquidity central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists primarily of hqla. hqla is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the lcr. as a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum lcr under the lcr rule approved by u.s. banking regulators. the lcr is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. the lcr measures an institution's hqla against its net cash outflows. hqla primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the lcr rule. the lcr was fully implemented beginning on january 1, 2017. we report lcr to the federal reserve daily. for the quarters ended december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, daily average lcr for the parent company was 108% and 112%, respectively. the average hqla for the parent company under the lcr final rule definition was $91.67 billion and $65.35 billion for the quarters ended december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively.
state street corporation | 89
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve of approximately $44.17 billion at the federal reserve, the ecb and other non-u.s. central banks as of december 31, 2018, compared to $33.58 billion as of december 31, 2017. the higher levels of average cash balances with central banks was due to normal deposit volatility. the increase in average hqla for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, was primarily a result of the sale of approximately $26 billion in non-hqla securities during the year ended december 31, 2018, with a significant portion of the sales being reinvested into hqla.
liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the frbb, the fhlb, and other non-u.s. central banks. state street bank is a member of the fhlb. this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management. as of december 31, 2018, we had approximately $2 billion of outstanding borrowings from the fhlb. as of december 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings from the fhlb.
access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions. as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window or any other central bank facility.
in addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities. these securities are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity.
the average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $65.94 billion for the quarter ended december 31, 2018, compared to $66.10 billion for the quarter ended december 31, 2017.
measures of liquidity include lcr and nsfr, which are described in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to clients to settle securities transactions; or other permitted purposes. such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. a recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment of hqla from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program.
we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling $28.95 billion and $26.49 billion and standby letters of credit totaling $2.99 billion and $3.16 billion as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively. these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. as of december 31, 2018, approximately 73% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and 27% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
information about our resolution planning and the impact actions under our resolution plans could have on our liquidity is provided in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
funding deposits we provide products and services including custody, accounting, administration, daily pricing, foreign exchange services, cash management, financial asset management, securities finance and investment advisory services. as a provider of these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. as a global custodian, clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies. as of both december 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 60% of our average total deposit balances were denominated in u.s. dollars, approximately 20% in eur, 10% in gbp and 10% in all other currencies.
short-term funding our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. in addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors. as discussed earlier under "asset liquidity," state street bank's membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. these transactions are short-term in nature, generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities. these balances were $1.08 billion and $2.84 billion as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations state street bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of cad 1.40 billion, or approximately $1.03 billion, as of december 31, 2018, to support its canadian securities processing operations. the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. as of december 31, 2018, there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit.
long-term funding we have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our clients. in addition, state street bank also has current authorization from the board to issue up to $5 billion in unsecured senior debt and an additional $500 million of subordinated debt.
agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include:
•   diverse and stable core earnings;
•   relative market position;
•   strong risk management;
•   strong capital ratios;
•   diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits;
•   strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and
•   preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:
•   providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors;
•   increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products;
•   serving markets; and
•   engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.
a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of funds. in turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.
a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operational risk management overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. operational risk encompasses fiduciary risk and legal risk. fiduciary risk is defined as the risk that we fail to properly exercise our fiduciary duties in our provision of products or services to clients. legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations.
operational risk is inherent in the performance of investment servicing and investment management activities on behalf of our clients. whether it be fiduciary risk, risk associated with execution and processing or other types of operational risk, a consistent, transparent and effective operational risk framework is key to identifying, monitoring and managing operational risk.
we have established an operational risk framework that is based on three major goals:
•strong, active governance;
•ownership and accountability; and
•consistency and transparency.
governance our board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall operational risk framework. it does so through its rc, which reviews our operational risk framework and approves our operational risk policy annually.
our operational risk policy establishes our approach to our management of operational risk across our business. the policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of operational risk, and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the operational risk framework.
erm and other control groups provide the oversight, validation and verification of the management and measurement of operational risk.
executive management actively manages and oversees our operational risk framework through membership on various risk management committees, including mrac, the bcrc, torc, the operational risk committee, the executive information security steering committee, business controls steering committee, compliance and ethics committee and the fiduciary review committee, all of which ultimately report to the appropriate committee of the board.
the operational risk committee, chaired by the global head of operational risk and co-chaired by the flod head of business controls, provides cross-business oversight of operational risk, operational risk programs and their implementation to identify, measure, manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner and reviews and approves operational risk guidelines intended to maintain a consistent implementation of our corporate operational risk policy and framework.
ownership and accountability we have implemented our operational risk framework to support the broad mandate established by our operational risk policy. this framework represents an integrated set of processes and tools that assists us in the management and measurement of operational risk, including our calculation of required capital and rwa.
the framework takes a comprehensive view and integrates the methods and tools used to manage and measure operational risk. the framework utilizes aspects of the coso framework and other industry leading practices, and is designed foremost to address our risk management needs while complying with regulatory requirements. the operational risk framework is intended to provide a number of important benefits, including:
•   a common understanding of operational risk management and its supporting processes;
•   the clarification of responsibilities for the management of operational risk across our business;
•   the alignment of business priorities with risk management objectives;
•   the active management of risk and early identification of emerging risks;
•   the consistent application of policies and the collection of data for risk management and measurement; and
•   the estimation of our operational risk capital requirement.
the operational risk framework employs a distributed risk management infrastructure executed by erm groups aligned with the business units, which are responsible for the implementation of the operational risk framework at the business unit level.
as with other risks, senior business unit management is responsible for the day-to-day operational risk management of their respective businesses. it is business unit management's responsibility to provide oversight of the implementation and ongoing execution of the operational risk framework within their respective organizations, as well as coordination and communication with erm.
consistency and transparency a number of corporate control functions are directly responsible for implementing and assessing various aspects of our operational risk framework, with state street corporation | 93
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the overarching goal of consistency and transparency to meet the evolving needs of the business:
•   the global head of operational risk, a member of the cro's executive management team, leads erm's corporate orm group. orm is responsible for the strategy, evolution and consistent implementation of our operational risk guidelines, framework and supporting tools across our business. orm reviews and analyzes operational key risk information, events, metrics and indicators at the business unit and corporate level for purposes of risk management, reporting and escalation to the cro, senior management and governance committees;
•   erm's corporate risk analytics group develops and maintains operational risk capital estimation models, and orm's capital analysis group calculates our required capital for operational risk;
•   erm's mvg independently validates the quantitative models used to measure operational risk, and orm performs validation checks on the output of the model;
•   cis establishes the framework, policies and related programs to measure, monitor and report on information security risks, including the effectiveness of cyber security program protections. cis defines and manages the enterprise-wide information security program. cis coordinates with information technology, control functions and business units to support the confidentiality, integrity and availability of corporate information assets. cis identifies and employs a risk-based methodology consistent with applicable regulatory cyber security requirements and monitors the compliance of our systems with information security policies; and
•   corporate audit performs separate reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies utilized across our business.
our operational risk framework consists of five components, each described below, which provide a working structure that integrates distinct risk programs into a continuous process focused on managing and measuring operational risk in a coordinated and consistent manner.
risk identification and assessments the objective of risk identification and assessments is to understand business unit strategy, risk profile and potential exposures. it is achieved through a series of risk assessments across our business using techniques for the identification, assessment and measurement of risk across a spectrum of potential frequency and severity combinations. three primary risk assessment programs, which occur annually, augmented by other business-specific programs, are the core of this component:
•   the risk assessment program seeks to understand the risks associated with day-to-day activities, and the effectiveness of controls intended to manage potential exposures arising from these activities. these risks are typically frequent in nature but generally not severe in terms of exposure;
•   the material risk identification process utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify our most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities. the program is specifically designed to consider risks that could have a material impact irrespective of their likelihood or frequency. this can include risks that may have an impact on longer-term business objectives, such as significant change management activities or long-term strategic initiatives;
•   the scenario analysis program focuses on the set of risks with the highest severity and most relevance from a capital perspective. these are generally referred to as "tail risks," and serve as important benchmarks for our loss distribution approach model (see below); they also provide inputs into stress testing; and
•   business-specific programs to identify, assess and measure risk, including new business and product review and approval, new client screening, and, as deemed appropriate, targeted risk assessments.
capital analysis the primary measurement tool used is an internally developed loss distribution approach (lda) model. we use the lda model to quantify required operational risk capital, from which we calculate rwa related to operational risk. such required capital and rwa totaled $3.68 billion and $46.06 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2018, compared to $3.67 billion and $45.82 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2017; refer to the "capital" section in "financial condition," of this management's discussion and analysis.
state street corporation | 94
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the lda model incorporates the four required operational risk elements described below:
•   internal loss event data is collected from across our business in conformity with our operating loss policy that establishes the requirements for collecting and reporting individual loss events. we categorize the data into seven basel-defined event types and further subdivide the data by business unit, as deemed appropriate. each of these loss events are represented in a uom which is used to estimate a specific amount of capital required for the types of loss events that fall into each specific category. some uoms are measured at the corporate level because they are not "business specific," such as damage to physical assets, where the cause of an event is not primarily driven by the behavior of a single business unit. internal losses of $500 or greater are captured, analyzed and included in the modeling approach. loss event data is collected using a corporate-wide data collection tool, which stores the data in a loss event data repository (ledr) to support processes related to analysis, management reporting and the calculation of required capital. internal loss event data provides our frequency and severity information to our capital calculation process for historical loss events experienced by us. internal loss event data may be incorporated into our lda model in a future quarter following the realization of the losses, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. an individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our lda model and our operational risk rwa under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event, its categorization among the seven basel-defined uoms and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom;
•   external loss event data provides information with respect to loss event severity from other financial institutions to inform our capital estimation process of events in similar business units at other banking organizations. this information supplements the data pool available for use in our lda model. assessments of the sufficiency of internal data and the relevance of external data are completed before pooling the two data sources for use in our lda model;
•   scenario analysis workshops are conducted across our business to inform management of the less frequent but most severe, or "tail," risks that the organization faces. the workshops are attended by senior business unit managers, other support and control partners and business-aligned risk management staff. the workshops are designed to capture information about the significant risks and to estimate potential exposures for individual risks should a loss event occur. the results of these workshops are used to make a comparison to our lda model results to determine that our calculation of required capital considers relevant risk-related information; and
•   business environment and internal control factors are gathered as part of our scenario analysis program to inform the scenario analysis workshop participants of internal loss event data and business-relevant metrics, such as risk assessment program results, along with industry loss event data and case studies where appropriate. business environment and internal control factors are those characteristics of a bank's internal and external operating environment that bear an exposure to operational risk. the use of this information indirectly influences our calculation of required capital by providing additional relevant data to workshop participants when reviewing specific uom risks.
monitoring, reporting and analytics the objective of risk monitoring is to proactively monitor the changing business environment and corresponding operational risk exposure. it is achieved through a series of quantitative and qualitative monitoring tools that are designed to allow us to understand changes in the business environment, internal control factors, risk metrics, risk assessments, exposures and operating effectiveness, as well as details of loss events and progress on risk initiatives implemented to mitigate potential risk exposures.
operational risk reporting is intended to provide transparency, thereby enabling management to manage risk, provide oversight and escalate issues in a timely manner. it is designed to allow the business units, executive management, and the board's control functions and committees to gain insight into activities that may result in risks and potential exposures. reports are intended to identify business activities that are experiencing processing issues, whether or not they result in actual loss events. reporting includes results of monitoring activities, internal and external examinations, regulatory reviews and control assessments. these elements combine in a manner designed to provide a view of potential and emerging risks facing us and information that details its progress on managing risks.
state street corporation | 95
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effectiveness and testing the objective of effectiveness and testing is to verify that internal controls are designed appropriately, are consistent with corporate and regulatory standards, and are operating effectively. it is achieved through a series of assessments by both internal and external parties, including corporate audit, independent registered public accounting firms, business self-assessments and other control function reviews, such as a sox testing program.
consistent with our standard model validation process, the operational risk lda model is subject to a detailed review, overseen by the mrc. in addition, the model is subject to a rigorous internal governance process. all changes to the model or input parameters, and the deployment of model updates, are reviewed and approved by the operational risk committee, which has oversight responsibility for the model, with technical input from the mrc.
documentation and guidelines documentation and guidelines allow for consistency and repeatability of the various processes that support the operational risk framework across our business.
operational risk guidelines document our practices and describe the key elements in a business unit's operational risk management program. the purpose of the guidelines is to set forth and define key operational risk terms, provide further detail on our operational risk programs, and detail the business units' responsibilities to identify, assess, measure, monitor and report operational risk. the guideline supports our operational risk policy.
data standards have been established to maintain consistent data repositories and systems that are controlled, accurate and available on a timely basis to support operational risk management.
information technology risk management overview and principles we define technology risk as the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information technology. technology risk includes risks potentially triggered by technology non-compliance with regulatory obligations, information security and privacy incidents, business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology operational events and adoption of new business technologies.
the principal technology risks within our technology risk policy and risk appetite framework include:
•   third party vendor risk;
•   business disruption and technology resiliency risk;
•   cyber and information security risk;
•   technology asset and configuration risk; and
•   technology obsolescence risk.
governance our board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall technology risk framework and program. it does so through its tops, which reviews and approves our technology risk policy and appetite framework annually.
our technology risk policy establishes our approach to our management of technology risk across our business. the policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of technology risk and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the technology risk framework.
risk control functions in the business are responsible for adopting and executing the enterprise technology risk management (etrm), technology risk framework and reporting requirements. they do this, in part, by developing and maintaining an inventory of critical applications and supporting infrastructure, as well as identifying, assessing and measuring technology risk utilizing the etrm framework. they are also responsible for monitoring and evaluating risk on a continual basis using key risk indicators, risk reporting and adopting appropriate risk responses to risk issues.
the chief technology risk officer, a member of the cro's executive management team, leads the etrm. etrm is the separate risk function responsible for the technology risk strategy and appetite, and technology risk framework development and execution. etrm also performs overall technology risk monitoring and reporting to the board, and provides a separate view of the technology risk posture to executive leadership.
we manage technology risks by:
•   coordinating various risk assessment and risk management activities, including erm operational risk programs;
•   establishing, through torc and tops of the board, the enterprise level technology risk and cyber risk appetite and limits;
•   producing enterprise level risk reporting, aggregation, dashboards, profiles and risk appetite statements;
•   validating appropriateness of reporting of information technology risks and risk acceptance to senior management risk committees and the board;
•   promoting a strong technology risk culture through communication;
state street corporation | 96
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   serving as an escalation and challenge point for technology risk policy guidance, expectations and clarifications;
•   assessing effectiveness of key enterprise information technology risk and internal control remediation programs; and
•   providing risk oversight, challenge and monitoring for the global continuity and third party vendor management program, including the collection of risk appetite, metrics and kris, and reviewing issue management processes and consistent program adoption.
cyber-security risk management cyber-security risk is managed as part of our overall information technology risk management as outlined above.
we recognize the significance of cyber-attacks and have taken steps to mitigate the risks associated with them. we have made significant investments in building a mature cyber-security program to leverage people, technology and processes to protect our systems and the data in our care. we have also implemented a program to help us better measure and manage the cyber-security risk we face when we engage with third parties for services.
all employees are required to adhere to our cyber-security policy and standards. our centralized information security group provides education and training. this training includes a required annual online training class for all employees, multiple simulated phishing attacks and regular information security awareness materials.
our business lines employ information security officers to help the business better understand and manage their information security risks, as well as to work with the centralized information security team to drive awareness and compliance throughout the business.
we use independent third parties to perform ethical hacks of key systems to help us better understand the effectiveness of our controls and to better implement more effective controls, and we engage with third parties to conduct reviews of our overall program to help us better align our cyber-security program with what is required of a large financial services organization.
we have an incident response program in place that is designed to enable a well-coordinated response to mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks, recover from the attack and to drive the appropriate level of communication to internal and external stakeholders.
the torc assesses and manages the effectiveness of our cyber-security program, which is overseen by the tops of our board. the tops receives regular cyber-security updates throughout the year and is responsible for reviewing and approving the program on an annual basis.
market risk management market risk is defined by u.s. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. we are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset-and-liability management, activities.
information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under "trading activities." information about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under "asset-and-liability management activities."
trading activities in the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility and our execution against those factors.
we engage in trading activities primarily to support our clients' needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity. in connection with certain of these trading activities, we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risk. these activities are generally intended to generate foreign exchange trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility. in addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets.
our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. with the growth of cross-border investing, our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward and option contracts in support of these client needs, and also act as a dealer in the currency markets.
as part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts and interest rate futures. as of december 31, 2018, the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $2.26 trillion, of which $2.24 trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. we seek to match positions state street corporation | 97
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations closely with the objective of minimizing related currency and interest rate risk. all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
governance our assumption of market risk in our trading activities is an integral part of our corporate risk appetite. our board reviews and oversees our management of market risk, including the approval of key market risk policies and the receipt and review of regular market risk reporting, as well as periodic updates on selected market risk topics.
the previously described tmrc (refer to "risk committees") oversees all market risk-taking activities across our business associated with trading. the tmrc, which reports to mrac, is composed of members of erm, our global markets business and our global treasury group, as well as our senior executives who manage our trading businesses and other members of management who possess specialized knowledge and expertise. the tmrc meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities.
our business units identify, actively manage and are responsible for the market risks inherent in their businesses. a dedicated market risk management group within erm, and other groups within erm, work with those business units to assist them in the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and control of market risk, and assist business unit managers with their market risk management and measurement activities. erm provides an additional line of oversight, support and coordination designed to promote the consistent identification, measurement and management of market risk across business units, separate from those business units' discrete activities.
the erm market risk management group is responsible for the management of corporate-wide market risk, the monitoring of key market risks and the development and maintenance of market risk management policies, guidelines and standards aligned with our corporate risk appetite. this group also establishes and approves market risk tolerance limits and trading authorities based on, but not limited to, measures of notional amounts, sensitivity, var and stress. such limits and authorities are specified in our trading and market risk guidelines which govern our management of trading market risk.
corporate audit separately assesses the design and operating effectiveness of the market risk controls within our business units and erm. other related responsibilities of corporate audit include the periodic review of erm and business unit compliance with market risk policies, guidelines and corporate standards, as well as relevant regulatory requirements. we are subject to regular monitoring, reviews and supervisory exams of our market risk function by the federal reserve. in addition, we are regulated by, among others, the sec, the financial industry regulatory authority and the u.s. commodities futures trading commission.
risk appetite our corporate market risk appetite is specified in policy statements that outline the governance, responsibilities and requirements surrounding the identification, measurement, analysis, management and communication of market risk arising from our trading activities. these policy statements also set forth the market risk control framework to monitor, support, manage and control this portion of our risk appetite. all groups involved in the management and control of market risk associated with trading activities are required to comply with the qualitative and quantitative elements of these policy statements. our trading market risk control framework is composed of the following components:
•   a trading market risk management process led by erm, separate from the business units' discrete activities;
•   clearly defined responsibilities and authorities for the primary groups involved in trading market risk management;
•   a trading market risk measurement methodology that captures correlation effects and allows aggregation of market risk across risk types, markets and business lines;
•   daily monitoring, analysis and reporting of market risk exposures associated with trading activities against market risk limits;
•   a defined limit structure and escalation process in the event of a market risk limit excess;
•   use of var models to measure the one-day market risk exposure of trading positions;
•   use of var as a ten-day-based regulatory capital measure of the market risk exposure of trading positions;
•   use of non-var-based limits and other controls;
•   use of stressed-var models, stress-testing analysis and scenario analysis to support the trading market risk measurement and management process by assessing how portfolios and global business lines perform under extreme market conditions;
•   use of back-testing as a diagnostic tool to assess the accuracy of var models and other risk management techniques; and
•   a new product approval process that requires market risk teams to assess trading-related market risks and apply risk tolerance limits to state street corporation | 98
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations proposed new products and business activities.
we use our cap to assess our overall capital and liquidity in relation to our risk profile and provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity levels. with respect to market risk associated with trading activities, our risk management and our calculations of regulatory capital are based primarily on our internal var models and stress testing analysis. as discussed in detail under "value-at-risk" below, var is measured daily by erm.
the tmrc oversees our market risk exposure in relation to limits established within our risk appetite framework. these limits define threshold levels for var- and stressed var-based measures and are applicable to all trading positions subject to regulatory capital requirements. these limits are designed to prevent any undue concentration of market risk exposure, in light of the primarily non-proprietary nature of our trading activities. the risk appetite framework and associated limits are reviewed and approved by the board's rc.
covered positions our trading positions are subject to regulatory market risk capital requirements if they meet the regulatory definition of a "covered position." a covered position is generally defined by u.s. banking regulators as an on- or off-balance sheet position associated with the organization's trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability, but does not include intangible assets, certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly traded. all fx and commodity positions are considered covered positions, regardless of the accounting treatment they receive. the identification of covered positions for inclusion in our market risk capital framework is governed by our covered positions policy, which outlines the standards we use to determine whether a trading position is a covered position.
our covered positions consist primarily of the trading portfolios held by our global markets business. they also arise from certain positions held by our global treasury group. these trading positions include products such as foreign exchange spot, foreign exchange forwards, non-deliverable forwards, foreign exchange options, foreign exchange funding swaps, currency futures, financial futures and interest rate futures. new activities are analyzed to determine if the positions arising from such new activities meet the definition of a covered position and conform to our covered positions policy. this documented analysis, including any decisions with respect to market risk treatments, must receive approval from the tmrc.
we use spot rates, forward points, yield curves and discount factors imported from third-party sources to measure the value of our covered positions, and we use such values to mark our covered positions to market on a daily basis. these values are subject to separate validation by us in order to evaluate reasonableness and consistency with market experience. the mark-to-market gain or loss on spot transactions is calculated by applying the spot rate to the foreign currency principal and comparing the resultant base currency amount to the original transaction principal. the mark-to-market gain or loss on a forward foreign exchange contract or forward cash flow contract is determined as the difference between the life-to-date (historical) value of the cash flow and the value of the cash flow at the inception of the transaction. the mark-to-market gain or loss on interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows from each leg of the swap transaction.
value-at-risk and stressed var we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including var, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. we use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading-related var daily. we have adopted standards for measuring trading-related var, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements.
we utilize an internal var model to calculate our regulatory market risk capital requirements. we use a historical simulation model to calculate daily var- and stressed var-based measures for our covered positions in conformity with regulatory requirements. our var model seeks to capture identified material risk factors associated with our covered positions, including risks arising from market movements such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and option-implied volatilities.
we have adopted standards and guidelines to value our covered positions which govern our var- and stressed var-based measures. our regulatory var-based measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period. we also use the same platform to calculate a one-tail, 99% confidence interval, one-business-day var for internal risk management purposes. a 99% one-tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses are not expected to exceed the estimated var more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year.
our market risk models, including our var model, are subject to change in connection with the governance, validation and back-testing processes described below. these models can change as a result of changes in our business activities, our historical experiences, market forces and events, regulations and state street corporation | 99
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory interpretations and other factors. in addition, the models are subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. changes in our models may result in changes in our measurements of our market risk exposures, including var, and related measures, including regulatory capital. these changes could result in material changes in those risk measurements and related measures as calculated and compared from period to period.
we calculate a stressed var-based measure using the same model we use to calculate var, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. the stressed var model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since july 2007. this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress. for each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day var from within the available historical data. this historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard & poor's downgrade of u.s. treasury debt in august 2011. as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be incorporated.
value-at-risk measures var measures are based on the most recent two years of historical price movements for instruments and related risk factors to which we have exposure. the instruments in question are limited to foreign exchange spot, forward and options contracts and interest rate contracts, including futures and interest rate swaps. historically, these instruments have exhibited a higher degree of liquidity relative to other available capital markets instruments. as a result, the var measures shown reflect our ability to rapidly adjust exposures in highly dynamic markets. for this reason, risk inventory, in the form of net open positions, across all currencies is typically limited. in addition, long and short positions in major, as well as minor, currencies provide risk offsets that limit our potential downside exposure.
our var methodology uses a historical simulation approach based on market-observed changes in foreign exchange rates, u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates and implied volatilities, and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. our var model incorporates approximately 5,000 risk factors and includes correlations among currency, interest rates and other market rates.
all var measures are subject to limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. some, but not all, of the limitations of our var methodology include the following:
•   compared to a shorter observation period, a two-year observation period is slower to reflect increases in market volatility (although temporary increases in market volatility will affect the calculation of var for a longer period); consequently, in periods of sudden increases in volatility or increasing volatility, in each case relative to the prior two-year period, the calculation of var may understate current risk;
•   compared to a longer observation period, a two-year observation period may not reflect as many past periods of volatility in the markets, because such past volatility is no longer in the observation period; consequently, historical market scenarios of high volatility, even if similar to current or likely future market circumstances, may fall outside the two-year observation period, resulting in a potential understatement of current risk;
•   the var-based measure is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and does not indicate the potential magnitude of losses beyond this confidence level;
•   in certain cases, var-based measures approximate the impact of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios; this may happen because the number of inputs included in the var model is necessarily limited; for example, yield curve risk factors do not exist for all future dates;
•   the use of historical market information may not be predictive of future events, particularly those that are extreme in nature; this "backward-looking" limitation can cause var to understate or overstate risk;
•   the effect of extreme and rare market movements is difficult to estimate; this may result from non-linear risk sensitivities as well as the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in the var calculations; and
•   intra-day risk is not captured.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations stress testing we have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserve's ccar process. stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).
stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by erm and reported to the tmrc. limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the tmrc if material. in addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt immediate review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.
we perform scenario analysis daily based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur. relevant scenarios are chosen from an inventory of historical financial stresses and applied to our current portfolio. these historical event scenarios involve spot foreign exchange, credit, equity, unforeseen geo-political events and natural disasters, and government and central bank intervention scenarios. examples of the specific historical scenarios we incorporate in our stress testing program may include the asian financial crisis of 1997, the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. and the 2008 financial crisis. we continue to update our inventory of historical stress scenarios as new stress conditions emerge in the financial markets.
as each of the historical stress events is associated with a different time horizon, we normalize results by scaling down the longer horizon events to a ten-day horizon and keeping the shorter horizon events (i.e., events that are shorter than ten days) at their original terms. we also conduct sensitivity analysis daily to calculate the impact of a large predefined shock in a specific risk factor or a group of risk factors on our current portfolio. these predefined shocks include parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts and foreign exchange spot and volatility surface shifts. in a parallel shift scenario, we apply a constant factor shift across all yield curve tenors. in a non-parallel shift scenario, we apply different shock levels to different tenors of a yield curve, rather than shifting the entire curve by a constant amount. non-parallel shifts include steepening, flattening and butterflies.
validation and back-testing we perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our var-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. this back-testing involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (p&l) outcomes observed from daily market movements. we back-test our var model using "clean" p&l, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and nii, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading.
our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity.
we experienced three back-testing exceptions in 2018 and one each in 2017 and 2016. the three back-testing exceptions in 2018 occurred in the last four months of the year when the markets experienced an abrupt increase in volatility. the heightened volatility follows several years of relatively benign market conditions that saw the vix routinely register as little as 10% or less. following such periods, it is quite common for var models calibrated to the most recent two years of data to underestimate the trading gains or losses that are experienced as volatility trends above levels that were seen more recently. in reference to the 2017 exception, the trading loss that day exceeded the var based on the prior day's closing positions, following the euro's forward point spike on short tenors driven by thinning liquidity and reduced volumes spurred by banks' year-end balance sheet preparations. in reference to the 2016 exception, the trading p&l that day exceeded the var based on the prior day's closing positions, following a large depreciation in the u.s. dollar against several major and emerging market currencies, primarily attributable to u.s. gdp growth rate being lower than expected and market reaction to bank of japan's decision to leave the interest rate unchanged.
our model validation process also evaluates the integrity of our var models through the use of regular outcome analysis. this outcome analysis includes back-testing, which compares the var model's predictions to actual outcomes using out-of-sample information. consistent with regulatory guidance, the back-testing compared "clean" p&l, defined above, with the one-day var produced by the model. the back-testing was performed for a time period not used for model development. the number of occurrences where "clean" trading-book p&l exceeded the one-day var was within our expected var tolerance level.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk reporting our erm market risk management group is responsible for market risk monitoring and reporting. we use a variety of systems and controlled market feeds from third-party services to compile data for several daily, weekly and monthly management reports.
the following tables present var and stressed var associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as measured by our var methodology. diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for each trading activity. this effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

the average of our stressed var-based measure was approximately $32 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to an average of approximately $28 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
while the average stressed var-based measure increased, the decrease in our stressed var-based measure at year end was mainly driven by lower end of day foreign exchange positions and reduced basis risk exposure in korean won forward rates as of december 31, 2018 compared to december 31, 2017.
the var-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities. overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations. both the ten-day var-based measures and the stressed var-based measures are based on historical changes observed during rolling ten-day periods for the portfolios as of the close of business each day over the past one-year period.
we may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate var and stressed var, subject to regulatory review and approval, and these modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our var-based and stressed var-based measures.
the following tables present the var and stressed-var associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the totals of the var-based and stressed var-based measures for the three attributes in total exceeded the related total var and total stressed var presented in the foregoing tables as of each period-end, primarily due to the benefits of diversification across risk types. diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for each trading activity. this effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

(1) for purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates.  forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate risk.  accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.
(2) as of december 31, 2018, we had no ten-day var or ten-day stressed var associated with volatility risk.
asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable nii under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried in our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency composition of our significant non-u.s. dollar denominated client liabilities.
we quantify nii sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning. this measure compares our baseline view of our nii over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of instantaneous and gradual rate shocks. eve sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a long-term horizon. each approach is routinely monitored as market conditions change.
in the table below, we report the expected change in nii over the next twelve months from +/-100 bps instantaneous and gradual parallel rate shocks. each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changes on our financial performance. while investment securities balances can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, our deposit balances remain consistent with the baseline.

-100 bps ramp             (72    )           (122    )
as of december 31, 2018, nii sensitivity remains positioned to benefit from rising interest rates. compared to december 31, 2017, our asset sensitive positioning to an instantaneous rise in rates is less sensitive, primarily driven by an increase in u.s. client deposit betas as a result of higher market rates.
state street corporation | 103
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we also routinely measure nii sensitivity to non-parallel rate shocks to isolate the impact of short-term or long-term market rates. in the up 100 bps instantaneous shock, approximately 70% of the expected benefit stems from the short-end of the yield curve. additionally, we quantify how much of the change is a result of shifts in u.s. and non-u.s. rates. in the up 100 bps instantaneous shock, approximately 30-40% of the benefit is driven by u.s. rates.
the following table highlights our eve sensitivity to a +/-200 bps instantaneous rate shock, relative to spot interest rates. management compares the change in eve sensitivity against our aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 risk-based capital, calculated in conformity with current applicable regulatory requirements. eve sensitivity is dependent on the timing of interest and principal cash flows. also, the measure only evaluates the spot balance sheet and does not include the impact of new business assumptions.

-200 bps shock              796        11
as of december 31, 2018, eve sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts in interest rates. compared to december 31, 2017, the change in the up 200 bps instantaneous shock was driven by higher u.s. interest rates and a mix shift in client deposits to more floating-rate, reducing deposit duration. the change in the down 200 bps instantaneous shock was primarily due to a modeling enhancement for negative rate currencies. the modeling enhancement allows for interest rate shocks to go below zero for certain currencies, such as euro, where central banks have allowed negative rates. the december 31, 2017 benefit, which does not reflect the modeling enhancement, in the down 200 bps shock would have increased approximately $1 billion under the new modeling approach.
this update aligns our modeling approaches for negative rates in both eve and nii sensitivity simulations.
model risk management the use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making. the models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of risk. in large banking organizations like us, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance. as a result, the model risk management framework seeks to mitigate our model risk.
our model risk management program has three principal components:
•   a model risk governance program that defines roles and responsibilities, including the authority to restrict model usage, provides policies and guidance, monitors compliance and reports regularly to the board on the overall degree of model risk across the corporation;
•   a model development process that focuses on sound design and computational accuracy, and includes activities designed to test for robustness, stability and sensitivity to assumptions; and
•   an independent model validation function designed to verify that models are conceptually sound, computationally accurate, are performing as expected, and are in line with their design objectives.
governance models used in the regulatory capital calculation can only be deployed for use after undergoing a model validation by erm's model risk management and receiving the result on the validation that allows for use or is permitted to be used by the mrc.
erm's model risk management group is responsible for defining the corporate-wide model risk governance framework, and maintains policies and guidelines that achieve the framework's objectives. the team is responsible for overall model risk governance capabilities, with particular emphasis in the areas of model validation, model risk reporting, model performance monitoring, tracking of new model development status and committee-level review and challenge.
mrc, which is composed of senior staff with technical expertise, reports to mrac, and provides guidance and oversight to the model risk management function.
model development and usage models are developed under standards governing data sourcing, methodology selection and model integrity testing. model development includes a state street corporation | 104
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statement of purpose to align development with intended use. it also includes a comparison of alternative approaches to promote a sound modeling approach.
model developers conduct an assessment of data quality and relevance. the development teams conduct a variety of tests of the accuracy, robustness and stability of each model.
model owners submit models to the model validation group for validation on a regular basis, as per existing policy.
model validation mvg is part of model risk management within erm and performs model validations. mvg is independent, as contemplated by applicable bank regulatory requirements, of both the developers and users of the models. mvg validates models through a review process that assesses the appropriateness, accuracy, and suitability of data inputs, methodologies, assumptions, and processing code. model validation also encompasses an assessment of model performance, sensitivity, and robustness, as well as a model's potential limitations given its particular assumptions or deficiencies. based on the results of its review, mvg issues a model use decision and may require remedial actions and/or compensating controls on model use. mvg also maintains a model risk rating system, which assigns a risk rating to each model based on an assessment of a model's inherent and residual risks. these ratings aid in the understanding and reporting of model risk across the model portfolio, and enable the triaging of needs for remediation. if a model owner disagrees with the results of a validation or any other aspect of model risk, they are permitted to raise the issue with the mrc for resolution.
strategic risk management we define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. we incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes. active management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business.
separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. for instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss. an additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition. failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue, would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.
strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans, which are subject to robust review and challenge from senior management and the board of directors, as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals. the potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. we use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk. management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes.
capital managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
framework our objective with respect to management of our capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients' cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. we strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long-term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital requirements.
our capital management focuses on our risk exposures, the regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to multiple capital measures, the evaluations and resulting credit ratings of the major independent rating agencies, our return on capital at both the consolidated and line-of-business level and our capital position relative to our peers.
state street corporation | 105
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations assessment of our overall capital adequacy includes the comparison of capital sources with capital uses, as well as the consideration of the quality and quantity of the various components of capital. the assessment seeks to determine the optimal level of capital and composition of capital instruments to satisfy all constituents of capital, with the lowest overall cost to shareholders. other factors considered in our assessment of capital adequacy are strategic and contingency planning, stress testing and planned capital actions.
capital adequacy process our primary federal banking regulator is the federal reserve. both we and state street bank are subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in fdicia. state street bank must exceed the regulatory capital thresholds for "well capitalized" in order for our parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. accordingly, one of our primary goals with respect to capital management is to exceed all applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements and to be "well-capitalized" under the pca guidelines established by the fdic. our capital management activities are conducted as part of our corporate-wide cap and associated capital policy and guidelines.
we consider capital adequacy to be a key element of our financial well-being, which affects our ability to attract and maintain client relationships; operate effectively in the global capital markets; and satisfy regulatory, security holder and shareholder needs. capital is one of several elements that affect our credit ratings and the ratings of our principal subsidiaries.
in conformity with our capital policy and guidelines, we strive to achieve and maintain specific internal capital levels, not just at a point in time, but over time and during periods of stress, to account for changes in our strategic direction, evolving economic conditions and financial and market volatility. we have developed and implemented a corporate-wide cap to assess our overall capital in relation to our risk profile and to provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital levels. the cap considers material risks under multiple scenarios, with an emphasis on stress scenarios, and encompasses existing processes and systems used to measure our capital adequacy.
capital contingency planning contingency planning is an integral component of capital management. the objective of contingency planning is to monitor current and forecast levels of select capital, liquidity and other measures that serve as early indicators of a potentially adverse capital or liquidity adequacy situation. these measures are one of the inputs used to set our internal capital adequacy level. we review these measures annually for appropriateness and relevance in relation to our financial budget and capital plan.
stress testing we administer a robust business-wide stress-testing program that executes multiple stress tests each year to assess the institution's capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions. our stress testing program is structured around what we determine to be the key risks incurred by us, as assessed through a recurring material risk identification process. the material risk identification process represents a bottom-up approach to identifying the institution's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, fiduciary, business, reputation and regulatory risks. these key risks serve as an organizing principle for much of our risk management framework, as well as reporting, including the "risk dashboard" provided to the board. over the past few years, stress scenarios have included a deep recession in the u.s., a break-up of the eurozone, a severe recession in china and an oil shock precipitated by turmoil in the middle east/north africa region.
in connection with the focus on our key risks, each stress test incorporates idiosyncratic loss events tailored to our unique risk profile and business activities. due to the nature of our business model and our consolidated statement of condition, our risks differ from those of a traditional commercial bank.
the federal reserve requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which includes us, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. the federal reserve uses its annual ccar process, which incorporates hypothetical financial and economic stress scenarios, to review those capital plans and assess whether banking organizations have capital planning processes that account for idiosyncratic risks and provide for sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. as part of its ccar process, the federal reserve assesses each organization's capital adequacy, capital planning process and plans to distribute capital, such as dividend payments or stock purchase programs. management and board risk committees review, challenge and approve ccar results and assumptions before submission to the federal reserve.
through the evaluation of our capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions, the stress testing processes provide important insights for capital planning, risk management and strategic decision-making for us.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations governance in order to support integrated decision making, we have identified three management elements to aid in the compatibility and coordination of our cap:
•   risk management - identification, measurement, monitoring and forecasting of different types of risk and their combined impact on capital adequacy;
•   capital management - determination of optimal capital levels; and
•   business management - strategic planning, budgeting, forecasting and performance management.
we have a hierarchical structure supporting appropriate committee review of relevant risk and capital information. the ongoing responsibility for capital management rests with our treasurer. the capital management group within global treasury is responsible for the capital policy and guidelines, development of the capital plan, the management of global capital and capital optimization.
mrac provides oversight of our capital management, our capital adequacy, our internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. in addition, mrac approves our balance sheet strategy and related activities. the board's rc assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to the assessment and management of risk and capital. our capital policy is reviewed and approved annually by the board's rc.
global systemically important bank we are one among a group of 29 institutions worldwide that have been identified by the fsb and the bcbs as g-sibs. our designation as a g-sib is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital buffer above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the basel iii final rule.
we and our depository institution subsidiaries are subject to the current basel iii minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines. the basel iii final rule incorporates several multi-year transition provisions for capital components and minimum ratio requirements for cet1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital.
additional information about g-sibs is provided under "regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards" in "supervision and regulation" in business in this form 10-k.
regulatory capital we and state street bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to the u.s. basel iii framework. provisions of the basel iii final rule became effective with full implementation on january 1, 2019. we are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by u.s. banking regulators effective as of january 2013.
the basel iii final rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy: the "standardized" approach and the "advanced" approaches, applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit rwa, including specified risk weights for certain on- and off-balance sheet exposures.
the advanced approaches consist of the airb approach used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk, and the ama approach used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk.
the final market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of var, that reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by the rule as "covered positions," as well as stressed-var measures to supplement the var measures. the rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related var and stressed-var measures. the qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is provided under "market risk" in this form 10-k.
as required by the dodd-frank act, we and state street bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a permanent "capital floor," also referred to as the collins amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy, including the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer. our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.
the requirement for the capital conservation buffer became effective with full implementation on january 1, 2019. specifically, the final rule limits a banking organization's ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if it fails to maintain a cet1 capital conservation buffer of more than 2.5% of total rwa and, if deployed during periods of excessive credit growth, a cet1 countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% of total rwa, above each of the minimum cet1, tier 1, and total risk-based capital ratios. the countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero by u.s. banking regulators.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to maintain the status of the parent company as a financial holding company, we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to be "well-capitalized" by maintaining capital ratios above the minimum requirements. effective on january 1, 2015, the "well-capitalized" standard for our banking subsidiaries was revised to reflect the higher capital requirements in the basel iii final rule.
the following table sets forth the transition to full implementation and the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements under the basel iii final rule.

(1) minimum ratios shown above do not reflect the countercyclical buffer, currently set at zero by u.s. banking regulators.
(2) as part of the g-sib surcharge final rule, the federal reserve published estimated g-sib surcharges for the eight u.s. g-sibs. the estimated resulting g-sib surcharge for us is 1.5%.
(3) minimum cet1 capital, minimum tier 1 capital and minimum total capital presented include the transitional capital conservation buffer as well as the estimated transitional g-sib surcharge that were phased-in beginning january 1, 2016 through january 1, 2019 based on an estimated 1.5% surcharge in all periods.
the specific calculation of our and state street bank's risk-based capital ratios changed as the provisions of the basel iii final rule related to the numerator (capital) and denominator (rwa) were phased in, and as our rwa calculated using the advanced approaches changed due to changes in methodology. these methodological changes result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile.
the following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for us and state street bank as of the dates indicated. we are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.
as a result of changes in the methodologies used to calculate our regulatory capital ratios from period to period, as the provisions of the basel iii final rule were phased in, the ratios presented in the table for each period are not directly comparable. refer to the footnotes following the table.

(1) amounts for us and state street bank as of december 31, 2018 consisted of goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities, and 100% of other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. amounts for us and state street bank as of december 31, 2017 consisted of goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities and 80% of other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities is phased in as a deduction from capital, in conformity with the basel iii final rule.
(2) other adjustments within cet1 capital primarily include the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit risk based deductions.
(3) includes a cva which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of over-the-counter derivative contracts. we used a simple cva approach in conformity with the basel iii advanced approaches.
(4) under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, rwa attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. an individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational rwa under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven basel-defined uoms.
(5) minimum requirements were phased in with full implementation beginning on january 1, 2019; minimum requirements listed are as of december 31, 2018. see table 38: basel iii final rules transition arrangements and minimum risk-based capital ratios.
(6) minimum requirements were phased in with full implementation beginning on january 1, 2019; minimum requirements listed are as of december 31, 2017. see table 38: basel iii final rules transition arrangements and minimum risk-based capital ratios.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our cet1 capital decreased $0.6 billion as of december 31, 2018 compared to december 31, 2017 primarily driven by goodwill and intangible assets deduction of $2.2 billion, capital distributions of $1.2 billion from common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases, accumulated other comprehensive loss of $0.4 billion and a $0.3 billion impact from the 2018 phase-in of the deduction of intangible assets (100% in 2018 compared to 80% in 2017), offset by net income of $2.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 and the issuance of common stock of $1.2 billion.
in the same comparative period, our tier 1 capital decreased $0.1 billion and total capital decreased $0.3 billion under both advanced approaches and standardized approach due to the changes in our cet1 capital offset by the issuance of preferred stock of approximately $500 million in the third quarter of 2018.

(1) standardized approach rwa as of the periods noted above were calculated using our estimates, based on our then current interpretation of the basel iii final rule.
(2) includes assets not in a definable category, cleared transactions, other wholesale, cash and due from, and interest-bearing deposits with banks and equity exposures.
as of december 31, 2018, total standardized approach rwa decreased $3.9 billion compared to december 31, 2017, primarily due to lower credit rwa. the main drivers of the credit rwa change were the sale of $26 billion of non-hqla within the investment securities portfolio and decreased repo-style transaction exposures. these decreases were partially offset by higher overdrafts and loans with corporates (both which have a higher prescribed risk weight under the standardized approach), and increases in all other exposures in the year ended december 31, 2018.
the regulatory capital ratios as of december 31, 2018, presented in table 39: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios, are calculated under the standardized approach and advanced approaches in conformity with the basel iii final rule. the advanced approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of december 31, 2018, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as "advanced systems," in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on form 10-q or an annual report on form 10-k. significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or state street corporation | 111
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. for example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven basel-defined uom, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. the full effects of the basel iii final rule on us and state street bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.
regulatory developments in april 2018, the frb issued a proposed rule which would replace the current 2% supplementary leverage ratio buffer for g-sibs, with a buffer equal to 50% of their g-sib buffer. this proposal would also make conforming modifications to our tlac and eligible ltd requirements applicable to g-sibs.
in addition, the frb has issued a separate proposed rule replacing the current 2.5% capital conservation buffer with a firm specific buffer (referred to as the stress capital buffer or scb), updated annually and tailored to reflect the results of the most recent federal reserve's ccar supervisory severely adverse scenario stress test. the proposal also introduces a stress leverage buffer (slb) applicable to the tier 1 leverage ratio. under the proposal, both the scb and slb would become effective october 1, 2019. changes to the final rules, if and when proposed, may be material and the application of the proposed rule involves estimates which cannot reasonably be made at present. consequently, we have not estimated the impact of the proposed rule.
the egrrcpa, which was signed into law by the u.s. president in may 2018, includes modifications to the slr requirements as applied to custody banks. specifically, the modifications would allow certain central bank deposits to be excluded from the slr denominator, or total leverage exposure. in addition, the act may impact our tlac and ltd requirements as the definition of the supplementary leverage ratio has been modified for custodial banks. our estimates as to our ltd needs at december 31, 2018, to satisfy tlac and ltd requirements, are subject to updates based on the changing regulatory landscape and additional regulatory guidance and interpretation.
supplementary leverage ratio in 2014, u.s. banking regulators issued final rules implementing an slr, for certain bank holding companies, like us, and their insured depository institution subsidiaries, like state street bank, which we refer to as the slr final rule. the slr final rule requires that, as of january 1, 2018, (i) state street bank maintain an slr of at least 6% to be well capitalized under the u.s. banking regulators' pca framework and (ii) we maintain an slr of at least 5% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. in addition to the slr, we are subject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, which differs from the slr primarily in that the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio is only a quarterly average of on-balance sheet assets and does not include any off-balance sheet exposures.

federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. in addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. for information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to "related stockholder matters" included under item 5, market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities, and to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the board at the relevant times.
stock purchases may be made using various types of mechanisms, including open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or transactions off market and may be made under rule 10b5-1 trading programs. the timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including, market conditions and our capital positions, financial performance and investment opportunities. the common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
off-balance sheet arrangements on behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. in most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $342.34 billion as of december 31, 2018, compared to $381.82 billion as of december 31, 2017. we require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. we hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. we revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. we held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $357.89 billion and $400.83 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively.

additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in notes 10, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
significant accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. additional information on our significant accounting policies, including references to applicable footnotes, is provided in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
certain of our accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements.
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the more significant accounting policies applied by us have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair value measurements, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, and contingencies. these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. an understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
the following is a discussion of the above-mentioned significant accounting estimates.
management has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the e&a committee of the board.
fair value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets and liabilities, afs debt securities, certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments.
changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in our consolidated statement of condition. in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition, and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. we estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below. additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
u.s. gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact; we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. when possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets and liabilities. when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market-observable data for similar assets and liabilities. in some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets; as a result, we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value.
we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on u.s. gaap's prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3).

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with respect to derivative instruments, we evaluated the fair value impact of the credit risk of our counterparties. we considered such factors as the market-based probability of default by our counterparties, and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities, in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired at the acquisition date. other intangible assets represent purchased long-lived intangible assets, primarily client relationships, core deposit intangible assets and technology that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. other intangible assets are initially measured at their acquisition date fair value, the determination of which requires management judgment. goodwill is not amortized, while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
management reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances arise or events occur that indicate an impairment of the carrying amount may exist. we begin our review by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. events that may indicate impairment include: significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more-likely-than-not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. if we conclude from the qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. however, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment.
during 2018, we assessed goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment. based on our evaluation of the qualitative factors noted above, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount.
other intangible assets are supported by the future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the intangible asset, less any costs associated with the intangible asset's eventual disposition. we evaluate other intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other groups of assets using the following process.  first, we routinely assess whether impairment indicators are present. when impairment indicators are identified as being present, we compare the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows of the intangible asset with its carrying value. if the future net undiscounted cash flows are greater than the carrying value, then there is no impairment, but if the intangible asset's net undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value, we are required to calculate impairment. an impairment is recognized by writing the intangible asset down to its fair value.  we evaluate intangible assets for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis. there were no impairments taken on other intangible assets in 2018.
additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
contingencies information on significant estimates and judgments related with establishing litigation reserves is discussed in note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.

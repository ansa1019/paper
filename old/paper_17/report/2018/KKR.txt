item 1a.  risk factors investing in our securities involves risk. persons investing in our securities should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. our business, financial condition or results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally, as well as other risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. in any such case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your original investment. while we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable, we can provide no assurance, and we make no representation, that our mitigation efforts will be successful.
risks related to our business difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.
our business and the businesses of the companies in which we invest are materially affected by financial markets and economic conditions or events throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations). for example, rising trade tensions between the united states and china, growing uncertainty regarding brexit, and the decision by the u.s. federal reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate in september and december of 2018 have contributed to the volatility in the u.s. stock markets in late 2018 and early 2019, which have adversely impacted the valuations of certain of our investments as of december 31, 2018. in addition, the unprecedented turmoil in the global financial markets during 2008 and 2009 provoked significant volatility of securities prices, contraction in the availability of credit and the failure of a number of companies, including leading financial institutions, and had a material adverse effect on our businesses and the businesses of the companies in which we invest. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-business environment" for a discussion of recent developments in market and business conditions that may affect our business.
such financial markets and economic conditions are outside our control and may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and liquidity and as a result, the value of our investments and our financial results. in addition, we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions and/or events. if not otherwise offset, declines in the equity, commodity and debt in the markets would likely cause us to write down our investments and the investments of our funds. for example, during the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, valuations of our private equity funds declined across all geographies, with investments in private equity funds marked down to as low as 67% of original cost and multiples of invested capital reaching as low as 0.5x, 0.6x, 0.7x and 0.8x for the european fund ii, european fund iii, 2006 fund and asian fund, respectively, as of march 31, 2009. our profitability may also be materially and adversely affected by our fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame sufficient to match any decreases in net income relating to a downturn in market and economic conditions.
32
unfavorable market and economic conditions may reduce opportunities for our funds to make, exit and realize value from their investments. challenging market and economic conditions, including those caused by changes in tax laws and other regulatory restrictions, may make it difficult for us to find suitable investments for our funds or secure financing for investments on attractive terms. such conditions may also result in reduced opportunities for our funds to exit and realize value from their existing investments and lower-than-expected returns on existing investments. although the equity markets are not the only means by which we exit investments, in challenging equity markets, our funds may experience greater difficulty in realizing value from investments. in addition, when financing is not available or becomes too costly, it is difficult for potential buyers to raise sufficient capital to purchase our funds' investments. consequently, we may earn lower-than-expected returns on investments, which could cause us to realize diminished or no carried interest.
we generally raise capital for a successor fund following the substantial and successful deployment of capital from the existing fund. in the event of poor performance by existing funds, our ability to raise new funds is impaired. our fundraising may also be negatively impacted by any change in or rebalancing of fund investors' asset allocation policies. during periods of unfavorable fundraising conditions, fund investors may negotiate for lower fees, different fee sharing arrangements for transaction or other fees, and other concessions. the outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than for prior funds we have managed. our current funds, including all our recent private equity funds, have performance hurdles, which require us to generate a specified return on investment prior to our right to receive carried interest. this requirement will likely be in all our future funds, and the hurdle rate could increase for our future funds. in addition, successor funds raised by us when such unfavorable circumstances described above exist would also likely result in smaller funds than our comparable predecessor funds. fund investors may also seek to redeploy capital away from certain of our credit or other non-private equity investment vehicles, which permit redemptions on relatively short notice, in order to meet liquidity needs or invest in other asset classes or with other managers. any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our future revenues, net income, cash flow, financial condition or ability to retain our employees. see "-our inability to raise additional or successor funds (or raise successor funds of a comparable size as our predecessor funds) could have a material adverse impact on our business" and "-our investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees, reimburse us for fewer expenses or change the economic terms of our future funds, including with respect to transaction fees, management fees or monitoring fees, to be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues or profitability."
during periods of difficult market or economic conditions or slowdowns (which may occur across one or more industries, sectors or geographies), companies in which we have invested may experience decreased revenues, financial losses, credit rating downgrades, difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs. these companies may also have difficulty in expanding their businesses and operations or be unable to meet their debt service obligations or pay other expenses as they become due, including amounts payable to us. negative financial results in our funds' portfolio companies may result in lower investment returns for our investment funds, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flow. to the extent the operating performance of such portfolio companies (as well as valuation multiples) deteriorate or do not improve, our funds may sell those assets at values that are less than we projected or even at a loss, thereby significantly affecting those funds' performance and consequently our operating results and cash flow and resulting in lower or no carried interest being paid to us. adverse conditions may also increase the risk of default with respect to private equity, credit and other investments that we manage or the abandonment or foreclosure of our real asset investments. even if economic and market conditions do improve broadly, adverse conditions in particular sectors may also cause our performance to suffer. finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus, economic stagnation or deflation may negatively impact expected returns on all types of investments as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and the supply decreases.
in addition, our capital markets business generates fees through a variety of activities in connection with the issuance and placement of equity and debt securities and credit facilities, with the size of fees generally correlated to overall transaction sizes. as a result, adverse conditions in financial markets as described above, as well as lower level of transaction activities involving our funds' investments, which can be unpredictable and outside our control, may negatively impact both the frequency and size of fees generated by our capital markets business.
changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our investment funds, their portfolio companies and strategies pursued with our balance sheet assets to obtain attractive financing for their investments or to refinance existing debt and may increase the cost of such financing or refinancing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income.
in the event that our funds are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms, our funds may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case, either of which could lead to a decrease in the investment income earned by us. any failure by lenders to provide previously committed financing can also expose us to
33
potential claims by sellers of businesses that we may have contracted to purchase. similarly, certain of the strategies pursued with our balance sheet assets rely on the use of leverage, including the issuance of clos, and other secured and unsecured borrowings. our ability to generate returns on these assets would be reduced to the extent that changes in market conditions, including continued increase by the u.s. federal reserve of its benchmark interest rate, cause the cost of our financing to increase relative to the income that can be derived from the assets acquired and financed. similarly, our portfolio companies regularly utilize the corporate debt markets in order to obtain financing for their operations. to the extent that credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance of those portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment returns on our funds. in addition, to the extent that conditions in the credit markets impair the ability of our portfolio companies to refinance or extend maturities on their outstanding debt, either on favorable terms or at all, the operating performance of those portfolio companies may be negatively impacted, which could impair the value of our investment in those portfolio companies and lead to a decrease in the investment income earned by us. in some cases, the inability of our portfolio companies to refinance or extend maturities may result in the inability of those companies to repay debt at maturity or pay interests when due, and may cause the companies to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection, any of which would also likely impair the value of our investment and lead to a decrease in investment income earned by us.
transition away from libor as a benchmark reference for interest rates may affect the cost of capital and may require amending or restructuring existing debt instruments and related hedging arrangements for us, our investment funds and our portfolio companies, and may impact the value of floating rate securities based on libor we or our investment funds hold or may hold in the future, which may result in additional costs or adversely affect our or our funds' liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
a substantial portion of the long-term indebtedness incurred by us, our investment funds and our portfolio companies bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor"). in july 2017, the u.k. financial conduct authority (the authority that regulates libor) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 and has indicated that market participants should not rely on libor being available after 2021. as an alternative to libor, for example, the u.s. federal reserve, in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee, a steering committee comprised of large u.s. financial institutions, is considering replacing u.s.-dollar libor with the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by treasury securities. although there have been a few issuances utilizing sofr or the sterling over night index average, an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, it is unknown whether any of these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for libor. there is currently no definitive successor reference rate to libor and various industry organizations are still working to develop workable transition mechanisms. as such, it is not possible to predict all potential effects of these changes on u.s. and global credit markets. if libor ceases to exist, we, our investments funds and our portfolio companies may need to amend or restructure our existing libor-based debt instruments and any related hedging arrangements that extend beyond 2021, which may be difficult, costly and time consuming. in addition, from time to time our funds invest in floating rate loans and investment securities whose interest rates are indexed to libor. uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to libor, or any changes announced with respect to such reforms, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported libor rates and the value of libor-based loans and securities, including those of other issuers we or our funds currently own or may in the future own, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings, including potentially, an increase to our and our funds' interest expense and cost of capital. any increased costs or reduced profits as a result of the foregoing may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
we have significant liquidity requirements, and adverse market and economic conditions may adversely affect our sources of liquidity, which could adversely affect our business operations in the future.
we expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to:
•   continue to grow our business lines, including seeding new strategies, funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies and otherwise supporting investment vehicles that we sponsor;
•   warehouse investments in portfolio companies or other investments for the benefit of one or more of our funds, accounts or clos pending the contribution of committed capital by the investors in such vehicles, and advancing capital to them for operational or other needs;
34
•   service debt obligations including the payment of obligations at maturity, on interest payment dates or upon redemption, as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments;
•   fund cash operating expenses and contingencies, including for litigation matters;
•   payment of additional corporate income taxes following the conversion;
•   pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings;
•   pay cash dividends in accordance with our dividend policy for our class a common stock or the terms of our preferred stock;
•   underwrite commitments, advance loan proceeds and fund syndication commitments within our capital markets business;
•   make future purchase price payments in connection with our proprietary acquisitions, such as our hedge fund partnership with marshall wace and our purchase of incremental equity interest in corporate capital trust, inc., to the extent not paid by newly issued class a common stock;
•   acquire other assets for our principal activities business line, including our office space, other businesses, investments and assets, some of which may be required to satisfy regulatory requirements for our capital markets business or risk retention requirements for clos (to the extent it continues to apply); and
•   repurchase our class a common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program or other securities issued by us.
these liquidity requirements are significant and, in some cases, involve capital that will remain invested for extended periods of time. as of december 31, 2018, we have approximately $5.3 billion of remaining unfunded capital commitments to our investment funds. our commitments to our funds will require significant cash outlays over time, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from realizations of investments to fund them. we have also used our balance sheet to provide credit support to our general partner's obligations to our funds and to support certain transactions by our funds.
in addition, as of december 31, 2018, we had $22.3 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities and debt securities on a gaap basis and $3.3 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities and debt securities on a segment basis, and $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis and $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments on a segment basis. the segment-based measures exclude the assets and liabilities of our investment funds, clos and cmbs, and other consolidated entities that are not subsidiaries of kkr & co. inc., but include kkr financial holdings llc's ("kfn") debt obligations, which as of december 31, 2018, consisted of $948.5 million, which do not provide for recourse to kkr beyond the assets of kfn. our $1.0 billion corporate revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in 2023. depending on market conditions, we may not be able to refinance or renew all or part of these senior notes or our corporate revolving credit facility, or find alternate sources of financing (including issuing equity), on commercially reasonable terms or at all. furthermore, the incurrence of additional debt by us or our subsidiaries in the future could result in downgrades of our existing corporate credit ratings, which could limit the availability of future financing and increase our costs of borrowing.
in addition, the underwriting commitments for our capital markets business may require significant cash obligations, and these commitments may also put pressure on our liquidity. the holding company for our capital markets business has entered into a credit agreement that provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million, which can only be used in connection with our capital markets business, including placing and underwriting securities offerings, and a 364-day revolving credit agreement that provides for revolving borrowings of up to $750 million, which can only be used to facilitate the settlement of debt transaction syndicated by our capital markets business. to the extent we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities in firm commitment underwritings or otherwise, we may be required to borrow under these revolving credit facilities to fund such obligations, which, depending on the size and timing of the obligations, may limit our ability to enter into other underwriting arrangements or similar activities, service existing debt obligations or otherwise grow our business. further, these facilities are scheduled to mature in 2021 and 2019, respectively, and depending on the market conditions, we may not be able to refinance or renew them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. regulatory net capital requirements may also limit the ability of our broker-dealer subsidiaries to participate in underwriting or other transactions or to allocate our capital more efficiently across our businesses.
35
our other liquidity requirements include potential future purchase price payments in connection with strategic partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers like marshall wace, based on the respective performance of these businesses or the exercise of certain options. in the fourth quarter of 2018, due to the exercise of one of the options agreed to between marshall wace and kkr, we acquired an additional 5.0% interest in marshall wace, for which we paid a combination of cash and shares of our class a common stock. in addition, in connection with the development of a new kkr office in new york city, we will be required to pay for our acquisition of the property in 2019 and to pay for the construction of the office, which is expected to be completed in 2020.
in the event that our liquidity requirements were to exceed available liquid assets for the reasons specified above or for any other reasons, we could be forced to sell assets or seek to raise debt or equity capital on unfavorable terms. for further discussion of our liquidity needs, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity."
the "clawback" provisions in our governing agreements may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require us to return or contribute amounts to our funds and fund investors.
the partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds relating to private equity, growth equity, infrastructure, energy, real estate, special situations, private credit opportunities, direct lending, revolving credit and core investments, generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a fund, the general partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, including the effects of any performance thresholds. we would continue to be subject to the clawback obligation even if carry has been distributed to current or former employees or other personnel through our carry pool, and we would be required to seek other sources of liquidity to fund such an obligation if such carry is not returned to us by them. as of december 31, 2018, no carried interest with respect to funds for which we are responsible for repayment was subject to this clawback obligation, assuming that all such carry-paying funds were liquidated at their december 31, 2018 fair values. had the investments in such carry-paying funds been liquidated at zero value, the clawback obligation would have been $2.0 billion.
carry distributions may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated to us and our principals who participate in the carry pool. in addition, guarantees of or similar arrangements relating to clawback obligations in favor of third-party investors in an individual investment partnership by entities we own may limit distributions of carried interest more generally.
strategic investor partnerships have longer investment periods and invest in multiple strategies, which may increase the possibility of a "netting hole," which will result in less carried interest for us, as well as clawback liabilities.
we have entered into strategic partnerships with certain investors, generally through separately managed accounts, which have longer investment periods, often of 20 years or more, and provide for investments across different investment strategies (which we refer to as "strategic investor partnerships"). compared to our traditional private equity fund structure, these partnerships may offer reduced fees for fund investors and may require netting across various funds in which they invest. generally, if a fund's investments have fair values above cost overall, but one or more of its investments has a fair value that is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investment (which we refer to as a "netting hole") must be "filled" by returning invested capital to such fund's limited partners in an amount equal to such shortfall before any realized gains on individual investments can be distributed to the general partner as carried interest. the longer investment period and cross-fund netting feature of the strategic investor partnerships increase the possibility of netting holes compared to our traditional private equity fund structure, which, if present, will reduce the carried interest we otherwise would earn. similarly, the longer duration of these partnerships can increase the risk of clawback, because over a longer investment period, a period of reduced performance following periods of performance adequate to realize carried interest is more likely to occur. see "-the 'clawback' provisions in our governing agreements may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require us to return or contribute amounts to our funds and fund investors."
our earnings and cash flow are highly variable due to the nature of our business and we do not intend to provide earnings guidance, each of which may cause the value of interests in our business to be volatile.
our earnings are highly variable from quarter to quarter due to the volatility of investment returns of most of our funds, other investment vehicles and our balance sheet assets and the fees earned from our businesses. we recognize earnings on investments in our funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains (or losses) reported by such funds and for certain of our recent funds, when a performance hurdle is achieved. during times of market volatility the fair value of our
36
funds and our balance sheet assets are more variable, and as publicly traded equity securities currently represent a significant proportion of the assets of many of our funds and balance sheet assets, volatility in the equity markets may have a significant impact on our reported results. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies-fair value measurements" for a discussion of the impact of equity markets on the value of private equity investments. a decline in realized or unrealized gains, a failure to achieve a performance hurdle or an increase in realized or unrealized losses, would adversely affect our net income.
fee income, which we recognize when contractually earned, can vary due to fluctuations in aum, the number of investment transactions made by our funds, the number of portfolio companies we manage, the fee provisions contained in our funds and other investment products and transactions by our capital markets business. in any particular quarter, fee income may vary significantly due to the variances in size and frequency of monitoring fees (including termination payments), transaction fees or fees received by our capital markets business. our total management, monitoring and transaction fees (net of fee credits) for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $1,569.1 million, $1,309.0 million and $906.0 million, respectively, on a gaap basis, and $1,853.9 million, $1,502.0 million and $1,074.9 million, respectively, on a segment basis. we may create new funds or investment products or vary the terms of our funds or investment products (for example our funds now include performance hurdles), which may alter the composition or mix of our income from time to time. in particular, in our newer private equity and other funds, we have agreed to return to our fund investors all monitoring and transaction fees generated by the fund's investments, which resulted in a decrease of our monitoring and transaction fee income. we may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter, including our revenue and net income, due to a number of other factors, including changes in the values of our funds' investments, changes in the amount of distributions or interest earned in respect of investments, changes in our operating expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition and general market and economic conditions. in addition, our earnings and cash flows are dependent in part on the performance of kfn, a specialty finance company that we acquired in 2014, and are subject to the risks to kfn's businesses as described elsewhere in the report. although kfn is a subsidiary of kkr, kfn has its own indebtedness outstanding. the terms of its indebtedness impose limitations on kfn's current and future operations and may restrict its ability to make distributions to kkr. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our net income attributable to kkr & co. inc. class a common stockholders on a gaap basis was $1,097.7 million, $984.9 million and $287.1 million, respectively, and our after-tax distributable earnings on a segment basis was $1,597.2 million, $1,355.6 million and $1,341.5 million, respectively. such fluctuations may lead to variability in the value of interests in our business and cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in future periods. it may be difficult for us to achieve steady growth in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis, which could in turn lead to large adverse movements in the value of interests in our business.
the timing and receipt of carried interest from our investment funds are unpredictable and will contribute to the volatility of our cash flows. for example, with respect to our private equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the fund has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost (which we refer to as a netting hole), cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. carried interest payments from investments depend on our funds' performance and opportunities for realizing gains, which may be limited. it takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities, to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value (or other proceeds) of an investment through a sale, public offering or other exit. to the extent an investment is not profitable, no carried interest will be received from our funds with respect to that investment and, to the extent such investment remains unprofitable, we will only be entitled to a management fee on that investment. furthermore, certain vehicles and separately managed accounts may not provide for the payment of any carried interest at all. even if an investment proves to be profitable, it may be several years before any profits can be realized in cash. we cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. in addition, if finance providers, such as commercial and investment banks, make it difficult for potential purchasers to secure financing to purchase companies in our investment funds' portfolio, it may decrease potential realization events and the potential to earn carried interest. a downturn in the equity markets would also make it more difficult to exit investments by selling equity securities. if we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter, the event may have a significant impact on our cash flows during the quarter that may not be replicated in subsequent quarters. a decline in realized or unrealized gains, or an increase in realized or unrealized losses, would adversely affect our investment income, which could further increase the volatility of our quarterly results.
the timing and receipt of carried interest also vary with the life cycle of certain of our funds. our carry-paying funds that have completed their investment periods and are able to realize mature investments, sometimes referred to as being in a "harvesting period," are more likely to make larger distributions than our carry-paying funds that are in their fund raising or investment periods that precede the harvesting period. during times when a significant portion of our aum is attributable to carry-paying funds that are not in their harvesting periods, we may receive substantially lower carried interest distributions.
37
in addition, we have formed strategic partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers in which kkr owns a minority stake (which we refer to as "hedge fund partnerships"). these third-party hedge fund managers offer a variety of investment strategies, including hedge fund-of-funds, equity hedge funds and credit hedge funds. as a result, we are indirectly exposed to the volatility and fluctuations in financial results of these hedge fund managers. for example, certain funds managed by the hedge fund managers have "high-water mark" provisions whereby if the funds have experienced losses in prior periods, the fund managers will not be able to earn incentive fees with respect to a fund investor's account until the net asset value of the fund investor's account exceeds the highest period end value on which incentive fees were previously paid. the incentive fees the hedge fund managers earn are therefore dependent on the net asset value of these funds, which could add to volatility in our quarterly results and cash flow.
a decline in the pace or size of investment by our funds would result in our receiving less revenue from fees.
the transaction and management or monitoring fees that we earn are driven in part by the pace at which our funds make investments and the size of those investments. any decline in that pace or the size of investments would reduce our revenue from transaction and management or monitoring fees. likewise, during an attractive selling environment, our funds may capitalize on increased opportunities to exit investments. any increase in the pace at which our funds exit investments, if not offset by new commitments and investments, would reduce future management fees. additionally, in certain of our funds that derive management fees only on the basis of invested capital, the pace at which we make investments, the length of time we hold such investment and the timing of disposition will directly impact our revenues. many factors could cause such a decline in the pace of investment or the transaction and management or monitoring fees we receive, including:
•   the inability of our investment professionals to identify attractive investment opportunities;
•   competition for such opportunities among other potential acquirers;
•   unfavorable market and economic conditions;
•   decreased availability of capital or financing on attractive terms;
•   our failure to consummate identified investment opportunities because of business, regulatory or legal complexities and adverse developments in the u.s. or global economy or financial markets;
•   terms we may agree with or provide to our fund investors or investors in separately managed accounts with respect to fees such as increasing the percentage of transaction or other fees we may share with our fund investors; and
•   new regulations, guidance or other actions provided or taken by regulatory authorities.
our inability to raise additional or successor funds (or raise successor funds of a comparable size as our predecessor funds) could have a material adverse impact on our business.
our current private equity funds and certain other funds and investment vehicles have a finite life and a finite amount of commitments from fund investors. once a fund nears the end of its investment period, our success depends on our ability to raise additional or successor funds in order to keep making investments and, over the long term, earning management fees (although our funds and investment vehicles continue to earn management fees after the expiration of their investment periods, they are generally at a reduced rate). even if we are successful in raising successor funds, to the extent we are unable to raise successor funds of a comparable size to our predecessor funds or the extent that we are delayed in raising such successor funds, our revenues may decrease as the investment period of our predecessor funds expire and associated fees decrease. for example, european fund iv was smaller than its predecessor fund and north america fund xi was smaller than its predecessor fund. the performance of our funds also impacts our ability to raise capital, and deterioration in the performance of our funds would result in challenges to future fundraising. the evolving preferences of our fund investors may necessitate that alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure, such as separately managed accounts, smaller funds and co-investment vehicles, become a larger part of our business going forward. this could increase our cost of raising capital at the scale we have historically achieved. furthermore, in order to raise capital for new strategies and products without drawing capital away from our existing products, we will need to seek new sources of capital such as individual investors.
our ability to raise new funds could also be hampered if the general appeal of private equity and alternative investments were to decline. an investment in a limited partner interest in a private equity fund is less liquid than an exchange traded instrument and the returns on such investment may be more volatile than an investment in securities for which there is a more active and transparent market. private equity and alternative investments could fall into disfavor as a result of concerns about
38
liquidity and short-term performance. institutional investors in private equity funds that have suffered from decreasing returns, liquidity pressure, increased volatility or difficulty maintaining target asset allocations may materially decrease or temporarily suspend making new investments in private equity funds. such concerns could be exhibited, in particular, by public pension funds, which have historically been among the largest investors in alternative assets. many public pension funds are significantly underfunded and their funding problems have been, and may in the future be, exacerbated by economic downturn. concerns with liquidity could cause such public pension funds to reevaluate the appropriateness of alternative investments, and other institutional investors may reduce their overall portfolio allocations to alternative investments. this could result in a smaller overall pool of available capital in our industry. there is no assurance that the amount of commitments investors are making to alternative investment funds will continue at recent levels or that our ability to raise capital from investors will not be hampered.
in addition, the asset allocation rules or regulations or investment policies to which such third-party investors are subject could inhibit or restrict the ability of third-party investors to make investments in our investment funds. coupled with a lack of distributions from their existing investment portfolios, many of these investors may have been left with disproportionately outsized remaining commitments to, and invested capital in, a number of investment funds, which may significantly limit their ability to make new commitments to third-party managed investment funds such as those advised by us.
fund investors may also seek to redeploy capital away from certain of our credit or other non-private equity investment vehicles, which permit redemptions on relatively short notice in order to meet liquidity needs or invest in other asset classes. we believe that our ability to avoid excessive redemption levels primarily depends on our funds' continued satisfactory performance, although redemptions may also be driven by other factors important to our fund investors, including their need for liquidity and compliance with investment mandates, even if our performance is superior. investors' liquidity needs tend to be more pronounced during periods of market volatility. any such redemptions would decrease our aum and revenues.
in addition, the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd-frank act"), under what has become known as the "volcker rule," broadly prohibits depository institution holding companies (including foreign banks with u.s. branches, agencies or commercial lending companies and certain insurance companies), insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, or "banking entities," from investing in "covered funds," including third-party private equity funds like ours. as a result, banking entities, subject to certain limited exemptions, had to conform their existing covered fund investments and relationships to the volcker rule, and will be limited in their ability to undertake new contractual commitments to private equity funds like ours. in addition to federal law, changes in state and local law may limit investment activities of state pension plans and insurance companies.
the number of funds raising capital varies from year to year, and in years where relatively few funds are raising capital, the growth of our aum, fpaum and associated fees may be significantly lower. there is no assurance that fundraises for new strategies or successor funds will experience similar success as our existing or predecessor funds in the future.
our investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees, reimburse us for fewer expenses or change the economic terms of our future funds, including with respect to transaction fees, management fees or monitoring fees, to be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues or profitability.
in connection with raising new funds or securing additional investments in existing funds, we negotiate terms for such funds and investments with our fund limited partners. the outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than the terms of prior funds we have advised or funds advised by our competitors. such terms could restrict our ability to raise investment funds with investment objectives or strategies that compete with existing funds, reduce fee revenues we earn, reduce the percentage of profits on third-party capital in which we share, increase the performance hurdle required to be generated on investment prior to our right to receive carried interest, add expenses and obligations for us in managing the fund or increase our potential liabilities. furthermore, as institutional investors increasingly consolidate their relationships with investment firms and competition becomes more acute, we may receive more requests to modify the terms in our new funds. certain of our newer funds also include more favorable terms for fund investors that commit to early closes for our funds. additionally, in certain funds, we have agreed to charge management fees based on invested capital or net asset value as opposed to charging management fees based on committed capital. in certain cases, we have provided "fee holidays" to certain investors during which we do not charge management fees for a fixed period of time (such as the first six months).  agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us could result in a material decrease in our profitability.
certain institutional investors have also publicly criticized certain fund fee and expense structures, including monitoring fees and transaction fees. we have received and expect to continue to receive requests from a variety of fund investors and
39
groups representing such investors to decrease fees and to modify our carried interest and incentive fee structures, which could result in a reduction or delay in the timing of receipt of the fees and carried interest and incentive fees we earn. the sec has focused on certain fund fees and expenses, including whether such fees and expenses were appropriately disclosed to fund limited partners, and such focus may lead to increased publicity that could cause fund investors to further resist our receipt of certain fees and expense reimbursements. in our recent flagship private equity funds, we have increased the percentage of transaction and monitoring fees that are credited against fund management fees to 100% of the amount of the transaction and monitoring fees attributable to that fund.
in addition, certain institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds, have demonstrated an increased preference for alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure, such as separately managed accounts, specialized funds and co-investment vehicles. we also have entered into strategic investor partnerships with specific investors whereby we manage that investor's capital across a variety of our products on separately negotiated terms. there can be no assurance that such alternatives will be as profitable to us as the traditional investment fund structure, and the impact such a trend could have on our results of operations, if widely implemented, is unclear. moreover, certain institutional investors are demonstrating a preference to in-source their own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of investment advisers like us. such institutional investors may become our competitors and could cease to be our clients.
any agreement to or changes in terms less favorable to us could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
the investment management business is intensely competitive, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
we compete as an investment manager for both fund investors and investment opportunities. the investment management business is highly fragmented, with our competitors consisting primarily of sponsors of public and private investment funds, real estate development companies, bdcs, investment banks, commercial finance companies and operating companies acting as strategic buyers of businesses. we believe that competition for fund investors is based primarily on:
•   investment performance;
•   investor liquidity and willingness to invest;
•   investor perception of investment managers' drive, focus and alignment of interest;
•   business reputation;
•   the duration of relationships with fund investors;
•   the quality of services provided to fund investors;
•   pricing;
•   fund terms (including fees); and
•   the relative attractiveness of the types of investments that have been or will be made.
we believe that competition for investment opportunities is based primarily on the pricing, terms and structure of a proposed investment and certainty of execution.
a number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:
•   a number of our competitors in some of our businesses may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do, and, in the case of some asset classes or geographic regions, longer operating histories, more established relationships, greater expertise or better reputation;
•   fund investors may materially decrease their allocations in new funds due to their experiences following an economic downturn, the limited availability of capital, regulatory requirements or a desire to consolidate their relationships with investment firms;
40
•   some of our competitors may have agreed to terms on their investment funds or products that are more favorable to fund investors than our funds or products, such as lower management fees, greater fee sharing or higher performance hurdles for carried interest, and therefore we may be forced to match or otherwise revise our terms to be less favorable to us than they have been in the past;
•   some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors' funds or other available investment products;
•   our competitors have raised or may raise significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives and strategies to our funds, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that many alternative investment strategies seek to exploit;
•   some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities;
•   some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments;
•   some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation or less regulatory scrutiny and accordingly may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we do and/or bear less expense to comply with such regulations than we do;
•   there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding the formation of new funds, including a relatively low cost of entering these businesses, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business, including major commercial and investment banks and other financial institutions, have resulted in increased competition;
•   some fund investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly traded, is smaller or manages fewer investment products; and
•   other industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us.
we may lose investment opportunities in the future if we do not match investment prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. our competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment. alternatively, we may experience decreased investment returns and increased risks of loss if we match investment prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. moreover, as a result, if we are forced to compete with other investment firms on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fund fee, carried interest or other terms. there is a risk that fees and carried interest in the alternative investment management industry will decline, without regard to the historical performance of a manager. fee or carried interest income reductions on existing or future funds, without corresponding decreases in our cost structure, could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
in addition, if interest rates were to rise or if market conditions for competing investment products become or are more favorable and such products begin to offer rates of return superior to those achieved by our funds, the attractiveness of our funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease. this competitive pressure could materially and adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future funds, either of which would adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flow.
changes in relevant tax laws, regulations or treaties or an adverse interpretation of these items by tax authorities could adversely impact our effective tax rate and tax liability.
our effective tax rate and tax liability is based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and treaties. these laws, regulations and treaties are complex, and the manner which they apply to us and our funds is sometimes open to interpretation. significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. although management believes its application of current laws, regulations and treaties to be correct and sustainable upon examination by the tax authorities, the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our effective tax rate. regarding the impact of the conversion on our income taxes, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 11 "income taxes."
in addition, tax laws, regulations or treaties newly enacted or enacted in the future may cause us to revalue our net deferred tax assets and have a material change to our effective tax rate and tax liabilities. for example, the tax cuts and jobs act, which
41
was enacted in december 2017 and amended various aspects of u.s. federal income tax legislation (the "2017 tax act"), has resulted in various changes to u.s. tax laws, including meaningful reduction to the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate and a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, which could have a material effect on our business operations and our funds' investment activities. these and other changes from the 2017 tax act, including the changes to the carryback and carryforward of net operating losses, u.s. taxation on earnings from international business operations and certain modifications to the section 162(m) of the code, could also have a significant effect on the business of our portfolio companies. additionally, foreign and state and local governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 tax act that could result in further changes to foreign and state and local taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.
the u.s. congress, the organization for economic co-operation and development (the "oecd") and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates invest or do business have maintained a focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational companies, such as kkr. the oecd has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting ("beps") project, which looks at various different ways in which domestic tax rules around the world, and the bilateral double tax treaties that govern the interplay between them, could be amended to address perceived profit shifting among affiliated entities. several of the proposed measures, including measures covering treaty abuse (including an anti-abuse "principal purpose" test that would deny treaty benefits to the extent that obtaining such benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in such benefit), the deductibility of interest expense, local nexus requirements, transfer pricing and hybrid mismatch arrangements are potentially relevant to some of our structures and could have an adverse tax impact on our funds, investors and/or our portfolio companies. some member countries have been moving forward on the beps agenda but, because timing of implementation and the specific measures adopted will vary among participating states, significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact of beps proposals. if implemented, these and other proposals could result in a loss of tax treaty benefits and increased taxes on income from our investments.
we depend on our founders and other key personnel, the loss of whose services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we depend on the efforts, skills, reputations and business contacts of our employees, including our founders, henry kravis and george roberts, and other key personnel, the information and deal flow they and others generate during the normal course of their activities and the synergies among the diverse fields of expertise and knowledge held by our professionals. accordingly, our success depends on the continued service of these individuals, who are not obligated to remain employed with us. the loss of the services of any of them could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, net income and cash flows and could harm our ability to maintain or grow aum in existing funds or raise additional funds in the future.
our employees and other key personnel possess substantial experience and expertise and have strong business relationships with investors in our funds and other members of the business community. as a result, the loss of these personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors in our funds and members of the business community and result in the reduction of aum or fewer investment opportunities. for example, if any of our key personnel were to join or form a competing firm, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.
furthermore, the agreements governing our committed capital funds generally provide that in the event certain "key persons" (for example, investment professionals who are named as "key executives" for certain geographically or product focused funds) cease to actively manage a fund or be substantially involved in kkr activities, investors in the fund will be entitled to reduce, in whole or in part, their capital commitments available for further investments on an investor-by-investor basis. in the case of certain of our fully paid-up funds, investors may be permitted to terminate their investment in the event a "key persons" provision is triggered, which could possibly lead to a liquidation of those funds. in addition, the occurrence of such a "key person" event could cause us to agree to less favorable ongoing terms with respect to the affected fund. although we periodically engage in discussions with the limited partners of our funds regarding a waiver of such provisions with respect to executives involved in geographically or product focused funds whose departures have occurred or are anticipated, such waiver is not guaranteed, and our limited partners' refusal to provide a waiver may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, net income and cash flow.
if we cannot retain and motivate our employees and other key personnel and recruit, retain and motivate new employees and other key personnel, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
our most important asset is our people, and our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our employees and other key personnel, and to a substantial degree on our ability to retain and motivate our employees and other key personnel and to strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented employees, including qualified investment professionals. however, we may not be successful in these efforts as the market for talented and qualified candidates is extremely competitive. our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our employees is dependent on our ability to offer highly attractive incentive
42
opportunities. under the 2017 tax act, investments must be held for more than three years, rather than the prior requirement of more than one year, for carried interest to be treated for u.s. federal income tax purposes as capital gain. the longer holding period requirement may result in some of our carried interest being treated as ordinary income, which would materially increase the amount of taxes that our employees and other key personnel would be required to pay, thereby adversely affecting our ability to offer attractive incentive opportunities. in addition, following the 2017 tax act, the tax treatment of carried interest may continue to be an area of focus for policymakers and government officials, which could result in a further regulatory action by federal or state governments. for example, certain states, including new york and california, have proposed legislation to levy additional state tax on carried interest, which may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees and key personnel. similarly, changes in the united kingdom with respect to the taxation of carried interest, including the treatment of certain carried interest returns as income, which became effective from april 6, 2016, may impact our ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees and key personnel in the united kingdom. in addition, there have been proposed laws and regulations that sought to regulate the compensation of certain of our employees. see "-extensive regulation of our business affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business." the loss of even a small number of our investment professionals could jeopardize the performance of our funds and other investment products, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. efforts to retain or attract employees, including our investment professionals, may result in significant additional expenses, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.
many of our employees hold interests in our business through kkr holdings. these individuals historically received financial benefits from our business in the form of distributions and amounts funded by kkr holdings and through their direct and indirect participation in the value of kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings. while all of our employees receive base salaries from us, annual cash bonuses for certain employees were historically borne by kkr holdings from its cash reserves based upon distributions on a portion of kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings. however, substantially all units in kkr holdings have been allocated to certain employees and non-employee operating consultants, and upon their vesting, distributions on vested units would belong to such unitholders and not be available to fund annual cash bonuses. in addition, under its dividend policy, kkr intends to make equal quarterly dividends to holders of its class a common stock in a fixed amount per share per quarter. in 2018, no annual cash bonuses were borne by kkr holdings. although kkr holdings may fund a portion of the cash bonus payments from its cash reserves, if any, in future periods, we likely will continue to utilize our own funds for most, if not all, of the cash bonus payments. in that event, either our profit margins or our employee retention or both may be adversely impacted. there can be no assurance that the carry pool will have sufficient cash available to continue to make such cash payments in the future and fluctuations from the distributions generated from the carry pool, if not offset by funds from other sources, including other performance-based income, could render our compensation less attractive. in any of these circumstances, a higher percentage of our revenue would be paid out in the form of cash compensation, which could have a material adverse impact on our profit margins. currently 40% or 43%, as applicable, of the carried interest earned from our investment funds is allocated to our carry pool. we are not permitted under our certificate of incorporation to increase the percentage of carried interest allocable to the carry pool without the consent of a majority of our independent directors.
we have granted equity awards from our equity incentive plan and expect to grant equity awards from our new equity incentive plan, which has caused and will cause dilution. if we increase the use of equity awards in the future, expense associated with equity-based compensation may increase materially. for example, in connection with compensation in 2018, we allocated equity awards relating to 5.5 million shares of class a common stock under our equity incentive plan and kkr holdings granted 0.5 million kkr holdings units to certain senior employees. these kkr holdings awards were granted from outstanding but previously unallocated units of kkr holdings, and consequently these grants did not increase the number of kkr holdings units outstanding or outstanding shares of kkr class a common stock on a fully-diluted basis. the value of our class a common stock may drop in value or be volatile, which may make our equity less attractive to our employees.
in july 2015, the sec proposed rules, as mandated by the dodd-frank act, requiring companies to develop and enforce recovery policies that in the event of an accounting restatement, "claw back" from current and former executive officers incentive-based compensation they would not have received based on the restatement. in april and may 2016, the sec also issued for public comment revised proposed rules designed to prohibit certain incentive-based compensation arrangements deemed to encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions by providing "excessive" compensation, fees or benefits or that could lead to material losses. to date, however, the sec has not adopted the proposed rules. depending on the outcome of the rule making process, the application of these rules to us could require us to substantially revise our compensation strategy, increase our compensation and other costs, and materially and adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees. in addition, less carried interest from the carry pool may be allocated to certain of our employees, which may result in less cash payments to such employees. to the extent our equity incentive or carry pool programs are not effective, we may be limited in our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees and other key personnel and we may need to increase the level of cash compensation that we pay.
43
in addition, there is no guarantee that the confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements to which our employees and other key personnel are subject, together with our other arrangements with them, will prevent them from leaving us, joining our competitors or otherwise competing with us. depending on which entity is a party to these agreements and/or the laws applicable to them, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, enforce them or become subject to lawsuits or other claims, and certain of these agreements might be waived, modified or amended at any time without our consent. even when enforceable, these agreements expire after a certain period of time, at which point each of our employees and other key personnel are free to compete against us and solicit our fund investors and employees. see "certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence-confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements."
we strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces our culture of collaboration, motivation and alignment of interests with fund investors. if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain our culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
operational risks and data security breaches may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth.
we rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems and on the systems of third parties who provide services to us. if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. in addition, we operate in businesses that are highly dependent on information systems and technology. for example, we face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions. we also face operational risk from transactions not being properly recorded, evaluated or accounted for in our funds. in particular, our public markets business line is highly dependent on our ability to process and evaluate, on a daily basis, transactions across markets and geographies in a time-sensitive, efficient and accurate manner. our and our third-party service providers' information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, may not be suitable for new products and strategies and may be subject to security risks, and the cost of maintaining such systems and technology may increase from our current level. such a failure to accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to such information systems and technology, could have a material adverse effect on our business. furthermore, most of our administrative personnel and our information system and technology infrastructure are located in our new york city office, and any disruption in the operation of, or inability to access, our new york city office could have a significant impact on our business. we are also dependent on an increasingly concentrated group of third-party vendors that we do not control for hosting solutions and technologies. a disaster or a disruption in technology or infrastructure that supports our businesses, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us, our vendors or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our principal offices, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. in addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.
our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. we face various security threats on a regular basis, including ongoing cyber-security threats to and attacks on our information technology infrastructure that are intended to gain access to our proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems. although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. we may be exposed to a more significant risk if these acts are taken by state actors. we and our employees have been and expect to continue to be the target of fraudulent calls and emails, and the subject of impersonations and fraudulent requests for money, and other forms of activities. the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. in addition, cyber-security has become a top priority for regulators around the world. many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cyber-security and protection of personal information, including the general data protection regulation in the european union that became effective in may 2018. some jurisdictions have also enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. breaches in security could potentially jeopardize our, our employees' or our fund investors' or counterparties' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our employees', our fund investors', our counterparties' or third parties' operations, which could result in significant losses, increased costs, disruption of our business, liability to our fund investors and other counterparties, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. furthermore, if we experience a cyber-security incident and fail to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, it could result in regulatory investigations and penalties, which could lead to negative publicity and may cause our fund investors and clients to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures. finally, we rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our business, including for certain information systems, legal services, technology, administration, tax and compliance matters. these third-party service providers could also
44
experience any of the above cyber-security threats, fraudulent activities or security breaches, and as a result, unauthorized individuals could improperly gain access to our confidential data. any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or cyber-security incidents involving these third parties could impair the quality of our and our funds' operations and could impact our reputation and materially and adversely affect our businesses and limit our ability to grow.
our portfolio companies also rely on data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, including payment and health information. a disruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on the value of these businesses. our funds may invest in strategic assets having a national or regional profile or in infrastructure, the nature of which could expose them to a greater risk of being subject to a terrorist attack or security breach than other assets or businesses. such an event may have material adverse consequences on our investment or assets of the same type or may require portfolio companies to increase preventative security measures or expand insurance coverage.
our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.
we intend, to the extent that market conditions warrant, to seek to grow our businesses by increasing aum in existing businesses, pursuing new investment strategies (including investment opportunities in new asset classes), developing new types of investment structures and products (such as separately managed accounts and structured products), and expanding into new geographic markets and businesses. we have in the past opened offices in asia and the middle east, and also developed a capital markets business in the united states, europe, the middle east and asia-pacific, which we intend to grow and diversify. we have also launched a number of new investment initiatives in areas such as real estate, energy, infrastructure, growth equity and core investments. introducing new types of investment structures and products could increase the complexities involved in managing such investments, including to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and terms of the investment. see "-we may not be successful in executing upon or managing the complexities of new investment strategies, markets and businesses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition."
our organic growth strategy focuses on providing resources to foster the development of new product offerings and business strategies by our investment professionals and launching successor and related products, such that our new strategies achieve a level of scale and profitability. given our diverse platform, these initiatives could create conflicts of interests with existing products, increase our costs and expose us to new market risks, and legal and regulatory requirements. the success of our organic growth strategy will also depend on, among other things, our ability to correctly identify and create products that appeal to the limited partners of our funds and vehicles. while we have made significant expenditures to develop these new strategies and products, there is no assurance that they will achieve a satisfactory level of scale and profitability. to raise new funds and pursue new strategies, we have and expect to continue to use our balance sheet to warehouse seed investments, which may decrease the liquidity available for other parts of our business. if a new strategy or fund does not develop as anticipated and such investments are not ultimately transferred to a fund, we may be forced to realize losses on these retained investments.
we have and may continue to pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners, strategic partnerships or other strategic initiatives, which may include entering into new lines of business. in addition, we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other alternative or traditional investment managers. for example, we have expanded our european credit business with our acquisition of avoca in 2014. we have also made minority investments in hedge fund managers, and we have entered into joint ventures with third parties to participate in new real estate investment strategies. on april 2018, we completed our transaction to form fs/kkr advisor, a strategic bdc partnership with fs investments, to provide investment advisory services to bdcs previously advised by us and fs investments. to the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions, undertake other strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with:
•   our ability to successfully negotiate and enter into beneficial arrangements with our counterparties;
•   the required investment of capital and other resources;
•   the incurrence of substantial transaction-related costs including non-recurring transaction-related costs;
•   delays or failure to complete an acquisition or other transaction in a timely manner or at all due to a failure to obtain shareholder or regulatory approvals or satisfy any other closing conditions, which may subject us to damages or require us to pay significant costs;
45
•   lawsuits challenging an acquisition or unfavorable judgments in such lawsuits, which may prevent the closing of the transaction, cause delays, or require us to incur substantial costs including in costs associated with the indemnification of directors;
•   the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk or liability or have not appropriately planned for such activities;
•   the possibility of diversion of management's time and attention from our core business;
•   the possibility of disruption of our ongoing business;
•   the failure to realize the anticipated benefits from an acquired business or strategic partnership in a timely manner, if at all;
•   combining, integrating or developing operational and management systems and controls including an acquired business's internal controls and procedures;
•   integration of the businesses including the employees of an acquired business;
•   potential increase in concentration of the investors in our funds;
•   disagreements with joint venture partners or other stakeholders in strategic partnerships;
•   the additional business risks of the acquired business and the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in foreign jurisdictions such as taxation;
•   properly managing conflicts of interests;
•   our ability to obtain requisite regulatory approvals and licenses without undue cost or delay and without being required to comply with material restrictions or material conditions that would be detrimental to us or to the combined organization; and
•   regulatory scrutiny or litigation exposure due to the activities of the acquired business, hedge fund partners or joint venture partners.
entry into new strategies or certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk and costs. if a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. our strategic initiatives include joint ventures or the acquisition of minority interests in third parties, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.
we may not be successful in executing upon or managing the complexities of new investment strategies, markets and businesses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our growth strategy is based, in part, on the expansion of our platform through selective investment in, and development or acquisition of, businesses and investment strategies complementary to our business. the expansion into new products and geographies has demanded greater management attention and dedication of resources to manage the increasing complexity of operations and regulatory compliance. this growth strategy involves a number of risks, including the risk that: the expected synergies from a newly developed product or strategic alliance will not be realized; the expected results will not be achieved; new strategies are not appropriately planned for or integrated into the firm; the new strategies may conflict, detract from or compete against our existing businesses; the investment process, controls and procedures that we have developed around our existing platform will prove insufficient or inadequate; or our information systems and technology, including related security systems, may prove to be inadequate. we have also entered into strategic investor partnerships and established separately managed accounts, which lack the scale of our traditional funds and are more costly to administer. the prevalence of these accounts may also present conflicts and introduce complexity in the deployment of capital. the offering of investment products to retail investors, including any funds registered under the investment company act, our bdcs and kref, may result in increased compliance and litigation costs. we may also incur significant charges in connection with such investments, which ultimately may result in significant losses and costs. such losses could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as harm our professional reputation.
46
if we are unable to syndicate the securities or indebtedness or realize returns on investments financed with our balance sheet assets, our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
our balance sheet assets provide us with a significant source of capital to grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our transactions and underwrite commitments in our capital markets business. we have used our balance sheet assets to underwrite loans, securities or other financial instruments, which we generally expect to syndicate to third parties. we also entered into an arrangement with a third party that reduces our risk associated with holding unsold securities when underwriting certain debt transactions, which enables our capital markets business to underwrite a larger amount. to the extent that we are unable to syndicate our commitments to third parties or our risk reduction arrangement does not fully perform as anticipated, we may be required to sell such investments at a significant loss or hold them indefinitely. if we are required to retain investments on our balance sheet for an extended period of time, our results would be directly impacted by the performance of such investments and it would also impair our capital markets business' ability to complete additional transactions, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we generally have a larger balance sheet than many of our competitors, and consequently, the performance of these balance sheet assets has a greater impact on our results of operations. our success in deploying our balance sheet assets and generating returns on this capital will depend, among other things, on the availability of suitable opportunities after giving priority in investment opportunities to our advised investment funds, the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources and our ability to value potential development or acquisition opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities. to the extent we are unsuccessful in deploying our balance sheet assets, our business and financial results may suffer. in addition, as our balance sheet assets have been a significant source of capital for new strategies, to the extent that such strategies are not successful or our balance sheet assets cease to provide adequate liquidity, we would be limited in our ability to seed new businesses or support our existing business as effectively as contemplated. see "-we may not be successful in executing upon or managing the complexities of new investment strategies, markets and businesses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition."
extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business.
our business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations, inquiries and investigations by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. many of these regulators, including u.s. federal and state and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, are empowered to impose fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including censure, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of applicable licenses and memberships. any of the foregoing may damage our relationships with existing fund investors, impair our ability to raise capital for successor funds, impair our ability to carry out certain investment strategies, or contravene provisions concerning compliance with law in agreements to which we are a party. even if a sanction is not imposed or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the regulatory activity or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing fund investors or fail to gain new fund investors.
in addition, actions by regulators against other investment managers can cause changes in business practices that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. in recent years, the private equity industry has come under increased regulatory and news media scrutiny with governmental officials and regulators, including the sec, focusing on the private equity industry's fees, allocation of expenses to funds, valuation practices, allocation of fund investment opportunities, particularly co-investment opportunities, and disclosures to fund investors. in recent years, the sec's focus areas included, among others, the acceleration of monitoring fees, the allocation of broken-deal expenses, the disclosure, use and compensation of operating partners or consultants, outside business activities of firm principals and employees, group purchasing arrangements, disclosure of affiliated service providers, general conflicts of interest disclosures, electronic messaging, cyber-security, data privacy and protection, foreign bribery and corruption, and policies covering insider trading, business continuity and transition planning. while it is unclear whether the sec will continue its pursuit of these or other focus areas, the sec's examination and enforcement program continues generally to focus on the alternative investment management industry in which we operate.
any changes or potential changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business, including the changes and potential changes described below, as well as adverse news media attention, may: impose additional expenses or capital requirements on us; limit our fundraising for our investment products; result in limitations in the manner in which our business is conducted; have an adverse impact upon our results of operations, financial condition, reputation or prospects; impair employee retention or recruitment; and require substantial attention by senior management. it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations, initiatives or regulatory guidance that may be proposed or may become law
47
on our business or the markets in which we operate. if enacted, any new law, regulation, initiatives or regulatory guidance could negatively impact our funds and us in a number of ways, including: increasing our costs and the cost for our funds of investing, borrowing, hedging or operating; increasing the funds' or our regulatory operating costs; imposing additional burdens on the funds' or our staff; and potentially requiring the disclosure of sensitive information. in addition, we may be materially and adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. new laws, regulations, initiatives or regulatory guidance could make compliance more difficult or more expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct business and divert significant management and operational resources and attention from our business. moreover, an increase in regulatory investigations and new or enhanced reporting requirements of the trading and other investment activities of alternative investment management funds and firms, including our funds and us, is possible. such investigations and reporting requirements could impose additional expenses on us, require the attention of senior management, increase the complexity of managing our business, or result in fines or other sanctions if we or any of our funds are deemed to have violated any law or regulations.
recent and potential regulatory changes in the united states. in recent years, there have been a number of changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business, including those required under the dodd-frank act. these changes have, among other things: increased regulatory scrutiny of our industry; increased our recordkeeping, reporting and disclosure requirements; and placed restrictions on the growth or type of activities certain financial institutions may pursue. in addition, under the prior administration, regulatory agencies proposed several regulations that, if adopted as proposed, may increase our compliance costs and affect our profitability in various ways. although the current administration is not presently pursuing all of these proposed regulatory actions, it or future administrations could redirect their attention to these or other areas at any time. we discuss below several recent or potential regulatory changes that may further impact our business.
financial stability oversight council ("fsoc"). established under the dodd-frank act, the fsoc is an inter-agency body charged with, among other things, designating systemically important nonbank financial companies for heightened prudential supervision and making recommendations regarding the imposition of enhanced regulatory standards regarding capital, leverage, conflicts and other requirements for financial firms deemed to pose a systemic threat to u.s. financial stability. the fsoc applies a three-stage review process to determine whether to designate a nonbank financial company as systemically important, with the level of scrutiny increasing at each stage. during the first stage, the fsoc applies a broad set of uniform quantitative metrics to identify nonbank financial companies that warrant additional review. in this first stage, the fsoc considers whether a nonbank financial company has at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets and whether it meets other thresholds relating to credit default swaps ("cds") outstanding, derivative liabilities, loans and bonds outstanding, a minimum leverage ratio of total consolidated assets to total equity of 15 to 1, and a short-term debt ratio of debt (with maturities less than 12 months) to total consolidated assets of 10%. a company that meets both the asset test and at least one of the other thresholds will be subject to additional review in stage 2. there is little guidance that specifically addresses the fsoc's method of calculating the relevant thresholds. it is possible that the fsoc could determine that we have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets and that we satisfy one or more of the other stage 1 criteria outlined above. additional uncertainty is created because the fsoc retains authority to designate any nonbank financial company as systemically important, even if the company does not meet the stage 1 criteria. historically, the fsoc focused on potential systemic risks arising from asset management products and activities. it is unclear whether the fsoc will continue to focus on this area. more recently, the fsoc has discussed the potential adoption of an "activities-based approach for monitoring and addressing potential risks to u.s. financial stability," although no formal action has yet been taken to modify its interpretive guidance on nonbank financial company designations. similarly, in a report issued on november 17, 2017, the u.s. treasury department recommended that the fsoc adopt an "activities-based or industry-wide approach," under which the fsoc would (1) review potential risks to financial stability arising from "activities and products," (2) work with relevant regulators to address any such risk identified by the fsoc, and (3) consider individual firms for designation only after consultation with relevant regulators. if the fsoc were to designate us as a systemically important nonbank financial company, we would become subject to supervision by the u.s. federal reserve and a heightened degree of regulation, including more stringent standards relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, resolution planning, credit exposure reporting and concentration limits, restrictions on acquisitions, and annual stress testing by the u.s. federal reserve. there can be no assurance that nonbank financial firms such as us will not become subject to the aforementioned restrictions or other requirements for financial firms deemed to be systemically important to the financial stability of the u.s. economy.
on december 18, 2014, the fsoc issued a notice seeking public comment on potential systemic risks from asset management products and activities, focusing in particular on (1) liquidity and redemption risks, (2) use of leverage, (3) operational functions and (4) resolution-related issues. on november 16, 2016, the fsoc reiterated its focus on these risk areas, as well as securities lending, in a public statement on its review of asset management products and activities. according to the notice and statement, the fsoc has not made any final determination regarding the existence or nature of any potential risks to financial stability posed by the asset management industry.
48
regulation of swaps. as mandated by the dodd-frank act, the commodity futures trading commission (the "cftc") has proposed or adopted a series of rules to establish a comprehensive new regulatory framework for swaps. under title vii of the dodd-frank act, the cftc has assumed regulatory authority over many types of swaps. as a result:
•   operating pooled funds that trade swaps, or providing investment advice to clients that trade swaps is a basis for registration with the cftc, absent an applicable exemption. although not mandated by the dodd-frank act, the cftc in 2012 issued a final rule that rescinded an exemption from cftc registration for commodity pool operators in connection with privately offered funds. operating our funds in a manner consistent with one or more exemptions from registration with the cftc may limit the activities of certain of our funds, and monitoring and analysis of these exemptions requires management and operational resources and attention. registration with the cftc, if required, could impact our operations and add additional costs associated with ongoing compliance.
•   the dodd-frank act also imposes regulatory requirements on the trading of swaps, including requirements that most swaps be executed on an exchange or "swap execution facility" and cleared through a central clearing house. although these requirements presently apply only to certain classes of interest rate swaps and cds, the cftc may mandate central execution and clearing with respect to additional classes of swaps in the future.
•   cftc regulations employ quantitative tests and thresholds to determine whether entities are "swap dealers" or "major swap participants" that must register in the appropriate category and comply with capital, margin, record keeping, reporting and business conduct rules. our funds could become subject to the requirement to register as major swap participants due to changes to the funds' investment strategy or valuations, or revisions to the thresholds for registration.
•   on december 5, 2016, the cftc re-proposed rules instituting position limits on certain physical commodity futures contracts that, if finalized as proposed, would limit positions in futures contracts on 25 agricultural, energy and metals commodities, including swaps and options that are economically equivalent to those commodity futures contracts. on the same day, the cftc finalized rules updating and restating its requirement that commonly owned and commonly controlled accounts and entities aggregate positions, absent an exemption, for position limit purposes. while these final aggregation rules currently expressly apply only to agricultural products for cftc purposes, the cftc may determine to expand them, and registered futures exchanges currently apply essentially identical rules to cover oil and gas and other commodities. if the proposed position limits rules are adopted in substantially the form proposed and if the aggregation rules are applied by the cftc or the exchanges in a way such that we do not qualify for an exemption, we could be required to aggregate the positions of our various investment funds and the positions of our portfolio companies for which we control trading, which in turn may require us and our portfolio companies to limit our trading activities, and impact the ability of our investment funds to invest or remain invested in certain derivatives, or engage in otherwise profitable acquisitions in particular industries. the dodd-frank act also requires the sec to establish position limits on security-based swaps, which rules could have a similar impact on our business.
•   the cftc and banking regulators have adopted, and the sec has proposed, rules regarding margin and capital requirements for most uncleared or "over-the-counter" swaps. these rules generally require swap dealers and major swap participants to collect and post a minimum amount of margin when trading with other covered entities and financial end-users. these requirements could increase the cost of trading in the derivative markets, which could in turn make it more expensive and difficult for us or our funds to enter into swaps and other derivatives in the normal course of our business and reduce the effectiveness of the funds' and our investment strategies. in certain cases, using non-deliverable forward transactions to hedge non-deliverable currencies such as the indian rupee, south korean won, malaysian ringgit and indonesian rupiah may be cost prohibitive or impractical to execute, because of the margin requirements or capital reserve required to be held against potential derivative liabilities. these rules could also adversely impact liquidity in derivatives markets, which could expose our funds and us to greater risks and reduce hedging opportunities in connection with their trading activities. variation margin requirements for uncleared swaps became effective in 2017, and initial margin requirements for uncleared swaps are expected to be phased in through 2020, depending on the aggregate notional amount of over-the-counter swaps traded by the funds and us.
•   in september 2016, the u.s. federal reserve issued for public comment a proposed rule that, if adopted as proposed, would impose significant capital and other prudential requirements on the physical commodities activities of certain banking organizations. the implementation of these or other new regulations could increase the cost of trading in the commodities and derivative markets, which could in turn make it more expensive and difficult for us or our funds to enter into swaps and other derivatives in the normal course of our business. moreover, these increased regulatory responsibilities and increased costs could reduce trading levels in the commodities and derivative markets by a number of market participants, which could in turn adversely impact liquidity in the markets and expose our funds to greater risks in connection with their trading activities.
49
other regulations under the dodd-frank act. the dodd-frank act amended the exchange act to compensate and protect whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information to the sec and establishes a fund to be used to pay whistleblowers who will be entitled to receive a payment equal to between 10% and 30% of certain monetary sanctions imposed in a successful government action resulting from the information provided by the whistleblower. the cftc has adopted a similar whistleblower program. in addition, in october 2011, the sec adopted a rule requiring certain advisers to private funds to periodically file reports on form pf, as required under the dodd-frank act. large private fund advisers including advisers with at least $1.5 billion in assets under management attributable to hedge funds and advisers with at least $2 billion in assets under management attributable to private equity funds are subject to more detailed and in certain cases more frequent reporting requirements. the information is to be used by the fsoc in monitoring risks to the u.s. financial system. these regulations increase our compliance costs and could result in adverse regulatory actions against us.
although it is possible that congress or the current administration could modify and relax regulatory requirements and restrictions that were adopted in response to the financial crisis, the timing and scope of such modifications remain uncertain and may not materialize.
eu-wide regulations. the eu alternative investment fund managers directive (the "aifmd"), which became effective on july 22, 2013, established a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory framework for alternative investment fund managers ("aifms") managing or marketing alternative investment funds ("aifs") in the european union. the aifmd imposes various substantive regulatory requirements on aifms, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses by (i) imposing disclosure obligations and restrictions on distributions by eu portfolio companies, (ii) requiring changes to our compensation structures for key personnel, thereby potentially affecting our ability to recruit and retain these personnel, (iii) increasing the cost and complexity of raising capital for our funds, which may slow the pace of fundraising, and (iv) generally increasing our compliance costs. in addition, there are areas of the aifmd that are subject to legal uncertainty, including the scope of the legal structures qualifying as aifs subject to aifmd. failure to comply with aifmd, even in areas where there is legal uncertainty, can result in enforcement action, including, but not limited to, fines.
although a subsidiary of ours is registered as an aifm with the central bank of ireland, we may not be able to benefit from an "eu passport" under the aifmd to market all of our funds to professional investors throughout the european union, and the eu marketing passport may not apply to marketing to investors in the united kingdom when its withdrawal from the european union becomes effective. see "-brexit" below.
the aifmd is currently subject to a legislative review by the european commission. it is not clear at this time what changes to the aifmd, if any, may be implemented and what impact any such changes would have on our business.
in july 2014, revisions to the markets in financial instruments directive (known as "mifid i"), consisting of the revised directive, "mifid ii," and a new related regulation, "mifir," came into force. mifid ii and mifir began applying to our european operations since january 2018. mifid ii and mifir introduced a number of new requirements for providing investment services and trading financial instruments in regards to transaction reporting, transparency, market infrastructure, securities and derivatives trading, and conduct of business rules, including new harmonized rules for authorization of eu branches of third-country firms seeking to provide certain investment services in the european union. the application of mifid ii and mifir increased regulatory burdens on a number of our subsidiaries, which could result in increased costs, and any failure to comply with the requirements, even in areas where there is legal uncertainty, could result in enforcement action, including, but not limited to, fines.
in july 2016, the market abuse regulation (known as "mar") became effective. under mar, certain of our european subsidiaries are required to, among other things, implement systems and controls regarding inside information, follow record keeping and other prescribed procedures for market soundings, and provide conflicts of interest and other relevant disclosure when providing investment recommendations. these requirements may increase the regulatory and compliance burden for a number of our european subsidiaries, which could result in increased costs, and any failure to comply with the requirements could result in enforcement action, including, but not limited to, fines.
in the european union, credit institutions and certain investment firms are subject to the provisions of the capital requirements directive iv ("crd iv") and the capital requirements regulation. these pieces of legislation implement the capital and liquidity standards promulgated by the basel committee on banking supervision (commonly referred to as "basel iii"), and impose various governance and remuneration obligations. crd iv has enhanced our financial reporting obligations and subjected us to new reporting requirements, which increases costs and the risk of non-compliance. compliance with basel iii may result in significant costs to banking organizations, which, in turn, could result in higher borrowing costs for us and our portfolio companies, and may reduce access to certain types of credit.
50
three of our subsidiaries (established in the uk and ireland) are subject to the remuneration-related requirements of crd iv, as well as similar requirements under the aifmd. additionally, the european banking authority has published final guidelines on sound remuneration policies under crd iv which set out the requirements for remuneration policies, group application and proportionality, along with criteria for the allocation of remuneration as fixed and variable and details on the disclosures required under the capital requirements regulation. these measures required changes in our compensation structures for key personnel, thereby potentially affecting these subsidiaries' ability to recruit and retain these personnel.
other eu bank regulatory initiatives that could result in higher borrowing costs for us and our portfolio companies or reduce access to certain types of credit include the european banking authority's guidelines on limits to exposures to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework under eu law (including funds employing leverage on a substantial basis, within the meaning of aifmd and its implementing rules, and credit funds), which entered into force on january 1, 2017, and guidelines on leveraged lending, proposed in november 2016 and modeled on u.s. leveraged lending guidelines.
in august 2012, the regulation on otc derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (also known as the european market infrastructure regulation, or "emir") became effective. emir applies to derivatives transactions in which one of the parties is established in the european union, and may in some circumstances apply to transactions between two non-eu counterparties where these contracts have a direct, substantial and foreseeable effect within the european union. the european commission adopted an equivalence decision for the united states in march 2016. however, ongoing regulatory uncertainty regarding the interaction between u.s. and eu requirements for central clearing and related activities could result in duplicative regulatory obligations in the two jurisdictions and could increase our costs of compliance. the implementation of any new regulations could increase the cost of trading in the commodities and derivative markets, which could in turn make it more expensive and difficult for us or our funds to enter into swaps and other derivatives in the normal course of our business. moreover, these increased regulatory responsibilities and increased costs could reduce trading levels in the commodities and derivative markets by a number of market participants, which could in turn adversely impact liquidity in the markets and expose our funds to greater risks in connection with their trading activities.
a number of other eu financial regulatory initiatives have the potential to materially and adversely affect our business. for example, the new securitisation regulation that became effective in 2019 established requirements for, among other things, due diligence, risk retention and disclosure regarding certain of our european investments, subsidiaries and clos. also, future acquisitions by kkr or our funds could lead to application of the european union's financial conglomerates directive, which establishes a prudential regime for financial conglomerates to address perceived risks associated with large cross-sector businesses, and could increase the costs of investing in insurance companies, investment firms and banks located in the european union. other eu financial regulatory initiatives such as the short selling regulation, which limits naked short selling of sovereign bonds and stocks, the bank recovery and resolution directive, which established a recovery and resolution framework for eu credit institutions and investment firms, and a new regulation on reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions, which requires all such transactions to be reported to trade repositories, places additional reporting requirements on investment managers and introduces prior risk disclosures and written consent before assets are rehypothecated, may all impact the complexity and cost of conducting our business in the european union. the european union has adopted, and may in the future adopt, additional risk retention and due diligence requirements in respect of various types of eu-regulated investors that, among other things, restrict investors from taking positions in securitization, increase the capital costs of originator, sponsor or original lender of a securitization, and require retaining a larger net economic interest in the securitization, which may adversely affect the profitability of us, our funds or our clos and the leveraged loan market generally. the implementation of these new requirements could increase our and our funds' or clos' costs and the complexity of managing our business and could result in fines if we or any of our funds or clos were deemed to have violated any of the new regulations.
the general data protection regulation, which became effective in may 2018, imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations, even if unfounded, could result in additional cost and liability and could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business.
brexit. on march 29, 2017, the government of the united kingdom made a formal notification to the european council under article 50 of the treaty of the european union, which triggered a two-year period during which the terms of the united kingdom's exit from the european union, commonly known as "brexit," were negotiated. the u.k. government's draft agreement on the withdrawal of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland from the european union was defeated in the house of commons on january 15, 2019. as a result, the final terms of the united kingdom's exit from the european union are, and will remain for the immediate future, unclear. the united kingdom may leave the european union
51
without any agreement as to the terms of its withdrawal or the future economic relationship between the united kingdom and the european union (a so-called "no deal" brexit). it is also possible that the united kingdom will withdraw its notification to leave the european union or that there will be a second referendum on brexit. the resulting legal and regulatory uncertainty in this regard may impact our business in a number of ways, not all of which are currently readily apparent, with the materiality of any risks dependent in large part on actions to be taken by the united kingdom and the european union. this uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to source investments and the value of our investments that are located in the united kingdom, or those that conduct business in or derive revenues from, the united kingdom. following brexit, our subsidiaries that are authorized and regulated by the u.k. financial conduct authority may no longer be able to avail themselves of passporting rights to provide services in other eu member states, while our central bank of ireland-authorized alternative investment fund manager may no longer benefit from the eu marketing passport to market products to investors in the united kingdom. while we have sought to take protective measures to allow us to continue to conduct our business in both the united kingdom and the european union, brexit may increase our cost of raising capital, underwriting and distributing securities and conducting business generally and interfere with our ability to market our products and provide our services. changes in regulation may also impair our ability to recruit, retain and motivate new employees and retain key employees. the united kingdom's exit could also lead to instability in the european union, including potential withdrawal by other member states, which would greatly amplify the adverse events described in this paragraph.
other regulations of the financial markets. certain requirements imposed by regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and are not designed to protect holders of interests in our business or our funds. consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities. in addition to many of the regulations and proposed regulations described above under "-recent and potential regulatory changes in the united states" and "-eu-wide regulations," u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies and the european central bank have issued leveraged lending guidance covering transactions characterized by a degree of financial leverage, although in the united states, the status of this guidance is uncertain as the u.s. government accountability office determined, in october 2017, that the guidance is subject to review under the congressional review act. if applied by the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies in its current form, such guidance would limit the amount or availability of debt financing available to borrowers and may increase the cost of financing we are able to obtain for our transactions and may cause the returns on our investments to suffer.
in 2016, the sec proposed a rule that would require registered investment advisers to adopt and implement written business continuity plans and transition plans based upon the particular risks associated with the individual adviser's operations and address several specified factors. under the current administration, there is some uncertainty as to whether the proposed rule will be adopted as proposed or at all. while it remains to be seen what the final rule, if adopted, will require, compliance with such a rule may impose additional costs on us.
in april 2018, the sec proposed a rule that would require a broker-dealer, or a natural person who is an associated person of a broker-dealer, to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities, without placing the financial or other interest of the broker, dealer or natural person who is an associated person of a broker-dealer making the recommendation ahead of the interest of the retail customer. the term "retail customer" is defined in the proposal as a person (including an entity) who uses such a recommendation primarily for personal, family or household purposes, without reference to investor sophistication or net worth. the "best interest" standard would be satisfied through compliance with certain disclosure, duty of care, and conflict of interest mitigation obligations. while it is unclear whether the proposed rule will be adopted in its current form or at all, if adopted, compliance with such a rule will impose additional costs to us, in particular with respect to our product offerings and investment platforms that include retail investors.
certain of the funds we manage that engage in originating, lending and/or servicing loans, may consider investments that would subject us to state and federal regulation, borrower disclosure requirements, limits on fees and interest rates on some loans, state lender licensing requirements and other regulatory requirements in the conduct of their business. if our funds make these investments, they may also be subject to consumer disclosures and substantive requirements on consumer loan terms and other federal regulatory requirements applicable to consumer lending that are administered by the consumer financial protection bureau. these state and federal regulatory programs are designed to protect borrowers.
state and federal regulators and other governmental entities have authority to bring administrative enforcement actions or litigation to enforce compliance with applicable lending or consumer protection laws, with remedies that can include fines and monetary penalties, restitution of borrowers, injunctions to conform to law, or limitation or revocation of licenses and other remedies and penalties. in addition, lenders and servicers may be subject to litigation brought by or on behalf of borrowers for violations of laws or unfair or deceptive practices. if we enter into transactions that subject us to these risks, failure to conform to applicable regulatory and legal requirements could be costly and have a detrimental impact on certain of our funds and ultimately on us
52
portfolio company legal and regulatory environment. we are subject to certain laws, such as certain environmental laws, takeover laws, anti-bribery, trade sanctions, trade control, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption laws, escheat or abandoned property laws, antitrust laws and data privacy and data protection laws that may impose requirements on us and our portfolio companies as an affiliated group. as a result, we could become jointly and severally liable for all or part of fines imposed on our portfolio companies or be fined directly for violations committed by portfolio companies, and such fines imposed directly on us could be greater than those imposed on the portfolio company. moreover, portfolio companies may seek to hold us responsible if any fine imposed on them is increased because of their membership in a larger group of affiliated companies. for example, on april 2, 2014, the european commission announced that it had fined 11 producers of underground and submarine high voltage power cables a total of 302 million euro for participation in a ten-year market and customer sharing cartel. fines were also imposed on parent companies of the producers involved, including goldman sachs, the former parent company of one of the cartel members. similarly, on february 16, 2018, the u.s. department of justice named a private equity sponsor as a co-defendant in a false claims act case against one of its portfolio companies, alleging that the private equity sponsor had an active involvement in managing the company and in developing its strategy to use illegal kickback payments to increase reimbursements. in addition, compliance with certain laws or contracts could also require us to commit significant resources and capital towards information gathering and monitoring thereby increasing our operating costs. for example, because we may indirectly hold voting securities in public utilities subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ("ferc"), including entities that may hold ferc authorization to charge market-based rates for sales of wholesale power and energy, we may be subject to certain ferc regulations, including regulations requiring us and our portfolio companies to collect, report and keep updated substantial information concerning our ownership of such voting interests and voting interests in other related energy companies, corporate officers, and our direct and indirect investment in such utilities and related companies. such rules may subject our portfolio companies and us to costly and burdensome data collection and reporting requirements.
in the united states, certain statutes may subject us or our funds to the liabilities of our portfolio companies. the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("cercla"), also referred to as the "superfund," requires cleanup of sites from which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances, and authorizes the u.s. environmental protection agency to take any necessary response action at superfund sites, including ordering potentially responsible parties liable for the release to pay for such actions. potentially responsible parties are broadly defined under cercla and could include us.
in addition, we or certain of our investment funds could potentially be held liable under u.s. employee retirement income security act of 1974 ("erisa") for the pension obligations of one or more of our portfolio companies if we or the investment fund were determined to be a "trade or business" under erisa and deemed part of the same "controlled group" as the portfolio company under such rules, and the pension obligations of any particular portfolio company could be material. on march 28, 2016, a federal district court judge in massachusetts ruled that two private equity funds affiliated with sun capital were jointly and severally responsible for unfunded pension liabilities of a sun capital portfolio company. while neither fund held more than an 80% ownership interest of the portfolio company, the percentage required under existing regulations to find liability, the court found the funds had formed a partnership-in-fact conducting a trade or business and that as a result each fund was jointly and severally liable for the portfolio company's unfunded pension liabilities. if the rationale of this decision were to be applied by other courts, we or certain of our investment funds could be held liable under erisa for certain pension obligations of portfolio companies. in addition, if the rationale of this decision were expanded to apply also for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then certain of our investors could be subject to increased u.s. income tax liability or filing obligations in certain contexts. similar laws that could be applied with similar results also exist outside of the united states.
similarly, our portfolio companies may be subject to contractual obligations which may impose obligations or restrictions on their affiliates. the interpretation of such contractual provisions will depend on local laws. given that we do not control all of our portfolio companies and that our portfolio companies generally operate independently of each other, there is a risk that we could contravene one or more of such laws, regulations and contractual arrangements due to limited access and opportunities to monitor compliance. in addition, compliance with these laws or contracts could require us to commit significant resources and capital towards information gathering and monitoring thereby increasing our operating costs.
complex regulations may limit our ability to raise capital, increase the costs of our capital raising activities and may subject us to penalties.
we regularly rely on exemptions in the united states from various requirements of the securities act, the exchange act, the investment company act, the commodity exchange act and erisa in conducting our investment management activities. these exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. if for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become subject to additional restrictive and costly registration requirements, regulatory action or third-party claims and our business could be

materially and adversely affected. for example, in raising new funds, we typically rely on private placement exemptions from registration under the securities act, including rule 506 of regulation d. however, rule 506 becomes unavailable to issuers (including our funds) if the issuer or any of its "covered persons" (certain officers and directors and also certain third parties including, among others, promoters, placement agents and beneficial owners of 20% of outstanding voting securities of the issuer) has been the subject of a "disqualifying event," which includes a variety of criminal, regulatory and civil matters (so-called "bad actor" disqualification). if our funds or any of the covered persons associated with our funds is subject to a disqualifying event, one or more of our funds could lose the ability to raise capital in a rule 506 private offering for a significant period of time, which could significantly impair our ability to raise new funds, and, therefore, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, if certain of our employees or any potential significant investor has been the subject of a disqualifying event, we could be required to reassign or terminate such an employee or we could be required to refuse the investment of such an investor, which could impair our relationships with investors, harm our reputation or make it more difficult to raise new funds. see "-risks related to our organizational structure-if we were deemed to be an 'investment company' subject to regulation under the investment company act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business."
we are and will become further subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as we expand our product offerings and investment platform to include retail investors. for example, funds in our public markets business line are registered under the investment company act as investment companies. these funds and kkr credit advisors (us) llc, which currently serves as their investment adviser, are subject to the investment company act and the rules thereunder, which, among other things, regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions and joint transactions. on april 2018, we completed our transaction to form fs/kkr advisor, a strategic bdc partnership with fs investments, to provide investment advisory services to bdcs previously advised by us and fs investments. bdcs are subject to certain restrictions and prohibitions under the investment company act. if any of the bdcs advised by fs/kkr advisor fails to meet the requirements for a bdc, it may be regulated as a closed-end investment company under the investment company act and become subject to substantially more regulatory restrictions, which could limit its operating flexibility and in turn result in decreased profitability for fs/kkr advisor. as our business expands we may be required to make additional registrations under the investment company act or similar laws, including in jurisdictions outside the united states. compliance with these rules will increase our compliance costs and create potential for additional liabilities and penalties the management of which would divert management's attention from our business and investments.
rule 206(4)-5 under the investment advisers act regulates "pay to play" practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to elected officials or candidates for political office who are able to exert influence on government clients. among other restrictions, the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government client for two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions to certain candidates and officials in position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government client. advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser's employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records in order to enable the sec to determine compliance with the rule. there has also been similar rule-making on a state-level regarding "pay to play" practices by investment advisers, including in california and new york. finra has released its own set of "pay to play" regulations that effectively prohibit the receipt of compensation from state or local government agencies for solicitation and distribution activities within two years of a prohibited contribution by a broker-dealer or one of its covered associates. any failure on our part to comply with these rules could cause us to lose compensation for our advisory services or expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage.
federal, state and foreign anti-corruption and trade sanctions laws applicable to us and our portfolio companies create the potential for significant liabilities and penalties and reputational harm.
we are subject to a number of laws and regulations governing payments and contributions to political persons or other third parties, including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"), as well as trade sanctions and trade control laws administered by the office of foreign assets control ("ofac"), the u.s. department of commerce and the u.s. department of state. the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign governments and their officials and political parties, and requires public companies in the united states to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies' transactions. ofac, the u.s. department of commerce and the u.s. department of state administer and enforce various trade control laws and regulations, including economic and trade sanctions based on u.s. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. these laws and regulations implicate a number of aspects of our business, including servicing existing fund investors, finding new fund investors, and sourcing new investments, as well as
54
activities by the portfolio companies in our investment portfolio or other controlled investments. some of these regulations provide that penalties can be imposed on us for the conduct of a portfolio company, even if we have not ourselves violated any regulation.
the iran threat reduction and syrian human rights act of 2012 ("itra") expanded the scope of u.s. sanctions against iran and requires public reporting companies to disclose in their annual or quarterly reports certain dealings or transactions the company or its affiliates "knowingly" engaged in during the previous reporting period involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions. in some cases, itra requires companies to disclose these types of dealings or transactions even if they are permissible under u.s. law or are conducted outside of the united states by a foreign affiliate. if any such activities are disclosed in a periodic report, we are required to separately file, concurrently with such report, a notice of such disclosure. the sec is required to post this notice on its website and send the report to the u.s. president and certain u.s. congressional committees. the u.s. president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and, within 180 days of initiating such an investigation, to determine whether sanctions should be imposed. disclosure of such activity, even if such activity is not subject to sanctions under applicable law, and any sanctions actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities, could harm our reputation and have a negative impact on our business.
similar laws in non-u.s. jurisdictions, such as eu sanctions or the u.k. bribery act, as well as other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, or sanction or other export control laws in the united states and abroad, may also impose stricter or more onerous requirements than the fcpa, ofac, the u.s. department of commerce and the u.s. department of state, and implementing them may disrupt our business or cause us to incur significantly more costs to comply with those laws. different laws may also contain conflicting provisions, making compliance with all laws more difficult. if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, civil or criminal financial penalties, reputational harm, incarceration of our employees, restrictions on our operations and other liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we may be subject to successor liability for fcpa violations or other acts of bribery, or violations of applicable sanctions or other export control laws committed by companies in which we or our funds invest or which we or our funds acquire.
we face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.
the activities of our businesses, including the investment decisions we make and the activities of our employees in connection with our portfolio companies, may subject us and them to the risk of litigation by third parties, including fund investors dissatisfied with the performance or management of our funds, holders of our or our portfolio companies' debt or equity, and a variety of other potential litigants. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 18 "commitments and contingencies-litigation." for example, we, our funds and certain of our employees are each exposed to the risks of litigation relating to investment activities of our funds and actions taken by the officers and directors (some of whom may be kkr employees) of portfolio companies, such as lawsuits by other shareholders of our public portfolio companies or holders of debt instruments of companies in which our funds have significant investments. we are also exposed to risks of litigation, investigation or negative publicity in the event of any transactions that are alleged not to have been properly considered and approved under applicable law.
although investors in our funds do not have legal remedies against us, the general partners of our funds, our funds, our employees or our affiliates solely based on their dissatisfaction with the investment performance of those funds, such investor may have remedies against us, the general partners of our funds, our funds, our employees or our affiliates to the extent any losses result from fraud, negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct. while the general partners and investment advisers to our investment funds, including their directors, officers, employees and affiliates, are generally indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to their conduct in connection with the management of the business and affairs of our investment funds, such indemnity generally does not extend to actions determined to have involved fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct. if any civil or criminal lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability or culpability, the lawsuit could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously impact our business.
furthermore, the current rise of populist political movements could result in negative public sentiment toward globalization, free trade, capitalism and financial institutions, which may lead to heightened scrutiny and criticisms of our business and our investments. the risk of reputational harm is elevated by the prevalence of internet and social media usage and the increased public focus on behaviors and externalities of business activities. we depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain fund investors and qualified professionals and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds. as a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and
55
press speculation about us, our investment activities or the private equity industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses.
with a workforce composed of many highly-paid professionals, we face the risk of litigation relating to claims for compensation or other damages, which may, individually or in the aggregate, be significant in amount. the cost of settling any such claims could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
certain types of investment vehicles may subject us to additional risk of litigation and regulatory scrutiny.
we have formed and may continue to form investment vehicles seeking investment from retail investors, which may subject us to additional risk of litigation and regulatory scrutiny. see "-extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business." we have and expect to continue to distribute products through new channels, including through unaffiliated firms, and we may not be able to effectively monitor or control the manner of their distribution, which could result in litigation against us, including with respect to, among other things, claims that products distributed through such channels are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or distributed in any other inappropriate manner. the distribution of products through new channels whether directly or through market intermediaries, including in the retail channel, could expose us to additional regulatory risk in the form of allegations of improper conduct and/or actions by state and federal regulators against us with respect to, among other things, product suitability, conflicts of interest and the adequacy of disclosure to customers to whom our products are distributed through those channels.
in addition, investment adviser subsidiaries of kkr externally manage a number of publicly traded permanent capital vehicles, including kref (a reit listed on the nyse) and kkr income opportunities fund (a closed-end management investment company). fs kkr capital corp. (a bdc listed on the nyse) is advised by fs/kkr advisor, in which we own a 50% interest. we may enter into new investment management agreements with other publicly traded permanent capital vehicles in the future. publicly traded permanent capital vehicles allow us to invest in longer-term strategies and secure stable fee streams, while providing liquidity to such vehicle's equity investors. however, these vehicles are subject to the heightened regulatory requirements applicable to public companies, including compliance with the laws and regulations of the sec, the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and the national securities exchanges on which their securities are listed, among others. these requirements will place increased demands on senior employees, require administrative, operational and accounting resources, and incur significant expenses. failure to comply with these requirements could result in a civil lawsuit, regulatory penalties, enforcement actions, or potentially lead to suspension of trading or de-listing from an exchange. furthermore, if the shareholders of these vehicles were to be dissatisfied with the investment performance or disagree with investment strategies employed by us, they may seek to cause the board of directors of the relevant vehicle to terminate the investment management agreement with us or change the terms of such agreement in a manner that is less favorable to us. as publicly traded entities, these permanent capital vehicles also face additional litigation risk, including class actions and other shareholder lawsuits, which would distract senior employees, including investment professionals.
misconduct of our employees, consultants or sub-contractors or by our portfolio companies could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.
there is a risk that our employees, consultants or sub-contractors could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. we are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our business and our authority over the assets we manage. the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees, consultants or sub-contractors would adversely affect our clients and us. we may also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by senior management of portfolio companies in which we invest, even though we may be unable to control or mitigate such misconduct. such misconduct may also negatively affect the valuation of the investments in such portfolio companies. our current and former employees, consultants or sub-contractors and those of our portfolio companies may also become subject to allegations of sexual harassment, racial and gender discrimination or other similar misconduct, which, regardless of the ultimate outcome, may result in adverse publicity that could significantly harm our and such portfolio company's brand and reputation. furthermore, our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which we may invest. if our employees, consultants or sub-contractors were improperly to use or disclose confidential information, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships, as well as face potentially significant litigation or investigation. it is not always possible to detect or deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. if any of our employees, consultants or sub-contractors or the employees of portfolio companies were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, our business and our reputation could be materially and adversely affected.
56
underwriting, syndicating and securities placement activities expose us to risks.
kkr capital markets llc and our other broker-dealer subsidiaries may act as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent in securities offerings and, through affiliated entities, loan syndications. we may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that, for any reason, we are unable to sell securities or indebtedness we purchased or placed as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent at the anticipated price levels or at all. as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent, we also may be subject to potential liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings our broker-dealer subsidiaries underwrite, syndicate or place. in certain situations, our broker-dealer subsidiaries may have liabilities arising from transactions in which our investment fund may participate as a purchaser of securities, which could constitute a conflict of interest or subject us to damages or reputational harm.
we are subject to risks in using third-party service providers, including prime brokers, custodians, administrators and other agents.
certain of our investment funds and our principal trading activities depend on the services of third-party service providers, including prime brokers, custodians, administrators and other agents, to carry out administrative or other services, including valuations, securities transactions, tax preparation and government filings. we are subject to risks of errors and mistakes made by these third parties, which may be attributed to us and subject us or our fund investors to reputational damage, penalties or losses. we may be unsuccessful in seeking reimbursement or indemnification from these third-party service providers.
furthermore, in the event of the insolvency of a prime broker and/or custodian, our funds may not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime broker's and custodian's unsecured creditors in relation to assets that the prime broker or custodian borrows, lends or otherwise uses. in addition, our and our funds' cash held with a prime broker or custodian may not be segregated from the prime broker's or custodian's own cash, and our funds therefore may rank as unsecured creditors in relation to that cash. the inability to recover assets from the prime broker or custodian could have a material adverse impact on the performance of our funds and our business, results of operations and financial condition. counterparties have generally reacted to recent market volatility by tightening their underwriting standards and increasing their margin requirements for all categories of financing, which has the result of decreasing the overall amount of leverage available and increasing the costs of borrowing. many of our funds have credit lines, and if a lender under one or more of these credit lines were to become insolvent, we may have difficulty replacing the credit line and one or more of our funds may face liquidity problems.
default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. in addition, concerns about, or a default by, one large market participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other market participants, which may in turn expose us to significant losses. we may not accurately anticipate the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, we may not have taken sufficient action to reduce these risks effectively, which, if left unmitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
risks related to the assets we manage as an investment manager, we sponsor and manage funds that make investments worldwide on behalf of third-party investors and, in connection with those activities, are required to deploy our own capital in those investments. the investments of these funds are subject to many risks and uncertainties which, to the extent they are material, are discussed below. in addition, we have investments on our balance sheet, which we manage for our own behalf. these risks, as they apply to our balance sheet investments, may have a greater impact on our results of operations and financial conditions as we directly bear the full risk of our balance sheet investments. as a result, the gains and losses on such assets are reflected in our net income and the risks set forth below relating to the assets that we manage will directly affect our operating performance.
the historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or our balance sheet investments, of our future results or the performance of our common stock.
we have presented in this report certain information relating to our investment returns, such as net and gross irrs, multiples of invested capital and realized and unrealized investment values for funds that we have sponsored and managed. the historical and potential future returns of the funds that we manage are not directly linked to returns on kkr group partnership units.
moreover, historical returns of our funds may not be indicative of the future results that you should expect from our funds or our balance sheet investments. in particular, the future results may differ significantly from their historical results for the following reasons, among others:
57
•   the rates of returns of our funds reflect unrealized gains as of the applicable valuation date that may never be realized, which may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from those funds' investments;
•   the historical returns that we present in this report derive largely from the performance of our earlier private equity funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds, which may have little or no investment track record, and in particular, you will not benefit from any value that was created in our funds prior to the kpe transaction to the extent such value has been realized and we may be required to repay excess amounts previously received in respect of carried interest in our funds if, upon liquidation of the fund, we have received carried interest distributions in excess of the amount to which we were entitled;
•   the future performance of our funds will be affected by macroeconomic factors, including negative factors arising from disruptions in the global financial markets that may not have been prevalent in the periods relevant to the historical return data included in this report;
•   in some historical periods, the rates of return of some of our funds have been positively influenced by a number of investments that experienced a substantial decrease in the average holding period of such investments and rapid and substantial increases in value following the dates on which those investments were made; those trends and rates of return may not be repeated in the future as the actual or expected length of holding periods related to investments is likely longer than such historical periods;
•   our newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they take to deploy their capital;
•   our funds' returns have benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions in certain historical periods that may not repeat themselves, and there can be no assurance that our current or future funds will be able to avail themselves of comparable investment opportunities or market conditions; and
•   we may create new funds and investment products in the future that reflect a different asset mix in terms of allocations among funds, investment strategies, geographic and industry exposure, vintage year and economic terms.
in addition, our historical rates of return reflect our historical cost structure, which has varied and may vary further in the future. certain of our newer funds, for example, have lower fee structures and also have performance hurdles. future returns will also be affected by the risks described elsewhere in this report, including risks of the industry sectors and businesses in which a particular fund invests and changes in laws. see "-risks related to our business-difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition."
valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds and on our balance sheet can be subjective and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized, which could result in significant losses for our funds and us.
there are no readily ascertainable market prices for a substantial majority of illiquid investments of our investment funds, our finance vehicles or other assets on our balance sheet. when determining fair values of investments, we use the last reported market price as of the statement of financial condition date for investments that have readily observable market prices. when an investment does not have a readily available market price, the fair value of the investment represents the value, as determined by us in good faith, at which the investment could be sold in an orderly disposition over a reasonable period of time between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale. there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith and in many cases fair value is best expressed as a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived. when making fair value determinations for our private equity investments, we typically use a market multiples approach that considers a specified financial measure (such as ebitda) and/or a discounted cash flow analysis. real asset investments in infrastructure, energy and real estate are valued using one or more of the discounted cash flow analysis, market comparables analysis and direct income capitalization, which in each case incorporates significant assumptions and judgments, and in certain cases may utilize the services of independent valuation firms. credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not available, credit investments are valued by us based on ranges of valuations determined by an independent valuation firm.
each of these methodologies requires estimates of key inputs and significant assumptions and judgments. we also consider a range of additional factors that we deem relevant, including the applicability of a control premium or illiquidity discount, the presence of significant unconsolidated assets and liabilities, any favorable or unfavorable tax attributes, the method of likely
58
exit, financial projections, estimates of assumed growth rates, terminal values, discount rates including risk free rates, capital structure, risk premiums, commodity prices and other factors, and determining these factors may involve a significant degree of our management's judgment and the judgment of management of our portfolio companies.
because valuations, and in particular valuations of investments for which market quotations are not readily available, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if a ready market had existed. even if market quotations are available for our investments, such quotations may not reflect the value that we would actually be able to realize because of various factors, including possible illiquidity associated with a large ownership position, subsequent illiquidity in the market for a company's securities, future market price volatility or the potential for a future loss in market value based on poor industry conditions or the market's view of overall company and management performance. our stockholders' equity could be adversely affected if the values of investments that we record is materially higher than the values that are ultimately realized upon the disposal of the investments and changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in our aum and such changes could materially affect the results of operations that we report from period to period. there can be no assurance that the investment values that we record from time to time will ultimately be realized and that we will be able to realize the investment values that are presented in this report.
because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of investments reflected in an investment fund's or finance vehicle's net asset value ("nav") do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained by us on behalf of the fund or finance vehicle when such investments are realized. for example, there may be liabilities such as unknown or uncertain tax exposures with respect to investments, especially those outside the united states, which may not be fully reflected in valuations. realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior fund navs would result in losses for the applicable fund and the loss of potential carried interest and other fees. also, if realizations of our investments produce values materially different than the carrying values reflected in prior fund navs, fund investors may lose confidence in us, which could in turn result in difficulty in raising capital for future funds.
in addition, because we value our entire portfolio only on a quarterly basis, subsequent events that may have a material impact on those valuations may not be reflected until the next quarterly valuation date.
our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition.
our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition. for example:
•   global equity markets, which may be volatile, significantly impact the valuation of our portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment income that we recognize. for our investments that are publicly listed and thus have readily observable market prices, global equity markets have a direct impact on valuation. for other investments, these markets have an indirect impact on valuation as we typically utilize market multiples (i.e. stock price of comparable companies divided by earnings or cash flow) as a critical input to ascertain fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. in addition, the valuation for any particular period may not be realized at the time of disposition. for example, because our private equity funds often hold very large amounts of the securities of their portfolio companies, the disposition of these securities often takes place over a long period of time, which can further expose us to volatility risk. in addition, the receptivity of equity markets to initial public offerings, as well as subsequent secondary equity offerings by companies already public, impacts our ability to realize investment gains. unfavorable market conditions, market volatility and other factors may also adversely impact our strategic partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers by influencing the level or pace of subscriptions or redemptions from the funds managed by our partners.
•   changes in credit markets can also impact valuations and may have offsetting results depending on the valuation methodology used. for example, we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. if applicable interest rates rise, then the assumed cost of capital for those portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. rising u.s. interest rates may also negatively impact certain foreign currencies that depend on foreign capital flows. conversely, a fall in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors. these
59
impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in interest rates. in certain cases, the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use, the market multiples approach, may yield different and offsetting results. for example, the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price. finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may also negatively impact expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases.
•   foreign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for example, u.s. dollar appreciation relative to other currencies is likely to cause a decrease in the dollar value of non-u.s. investments to the extent unhedged.
•   conditions in commodity markets impact the performance of our portfolio companies and other investments in a variety of ways, including through the direct or indirect impact on the cost of the inputs used in their operations as well as the pricing and profitability of the products or services that they sell. the price of commodities has historically been subject to substantial volatility, which among other things, could be driven by economic, monetary, political or weather related factors. if our funds' operator or our portfolio companies are unable to raise prices to offset increases in the cost of raw materials or other inputs, or if consumers defer purchases of or seek substitutes for the products of our funds or such portfolio companies, our funds or such portfolio companies could experience lower operating income which may in turn reduce the valuation of such funds' investments or those portfolio companies. the value of energy investments generally increase or decrease with the increase or decrease, respectively, of energy commodity prices and in particular with long-term forecasts for such energy commodity prices. given our investments in oil and gas companies and assets, the value of this portfolio and the investment income we realize is sensitive to oil and gas prices. the volatility of commodity prices also makes it difficult to predict commodity price movements. apart from our energy investments, a number of our other investments may be dependent to varying degrees on the energy sector through, for example, the provision of equipment and services used in energy exploration and production. these companies may benefit from an increase or suffer from a decline in commodity prices.
changes in these factors can have a significant effect on the results of the valuation methodologies used to value our portfolio, and our reported fair values for these assets could vary materially if these factors from prior quarters were to change significantly. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-business environment."
global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on the value of investments. see "-risks related to our business-difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition."
dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds and our balance sheet assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.
because many of our funds' investments and our balance sheet investments often rely heavily on the use of leverage, our ability to achieve attractive rates of return will depend on our continued ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. for example, our credit funds use varying degrees of leverage when making investments. similarly, in many private equity investments, indebtedness may constitute 70% or more of a portfolio company's total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment, and a portfolio company's indebtedness may also increase in recapitalization transactions subsequent to the company's acquisition. the absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time could therefore materially and adversely affect our funds and our portfolio companies. u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies and the european central bank have issued leveraged lending guidance covering transactions characterized by a degree of financial leverage. such guidance may limit the amount or availability of debt financing and may increase the cost of financing we are able to obtain for our transactions and may cause the returns on our investments to suffer. see "-risks related to our business-extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business."
an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness such as we experienced during the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 would make it more expensive to finance those investments. in addition, increases in interest rates could decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments that our balance sheet assets,
60
finance vehicles or our funds make. increases in interest rates could also make it more difficult to locate and consummate private equity and other investments because other potential buyers, including operating companies acting as strategic buyers, may be able to bid for an asset at a higher price due to a lower overall cost of capital or their ability to benefit from a higher amount of cost savings following the acquisition of the asset. in addition, a portion of the indebtedness used to finance private equity investments often includes high-yield debt securities issued in the capital markets. capital markets are volatile, and there may be times when we might not be able to access those markets at attractive rates, or at all, when completing an investment.
investments in highly leveraged entities are also inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments. the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:
•   subject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants, terms and conditions, any violation of which would be viewed by creditors as an event of default and could materially impact our ability to realize value from our investment;
•   allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render it unable to service its indebtedness;
•   give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity's ability to respond to changing industry conditions to the extent additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities;
•   limit the entity's ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have relatively less debt;
•   limit the entity's ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth; and
•   limit the entity's ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for capital expenditures, working capital or other general corporate purposes.
a leveraged company's income and equity also tend to increase or decrease at a greater rate than would otherwise be the case if money had not been borrowed. as a result, the risk of loss associated with a leveraged company is generally greater than for comparable companies with comparatively less debt. for example, leveraged companies could default on their debt obligations due to a decrease in revenues and cash flow precipitated by an economic downturn or by poor relative performance at such a company. similarly, the leveraged nature of some of our investments in real assets increases the risk that a decline in the fair value of the underlying real asset will result in their abandonment or foreclosure. for example, if the property-level debt on a particular investment has reached its maturity and the underlying asset value has declined below its debt-level, we may, in absence of cooperation by the lender in regards to a partial debt-write-off, be forced to put the investment into liquidation. in addition, the 2017 tax act partially limits the tax deductibility of interest, which could have a material adverse effect on our funds' investment activities and on operations of a leveraged company.
when our existing portfolio investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those investments matures in significant amounts and must be either repaid or refinanced, those investments may materially suffer if they have generated insufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the financing markets to permit them to refinance maturing debt on satisfactory terms, or at all. if the financing for such purposes were to be unavailable or uneconomic when significant amounts of the debt incurred to finance our existing portfolio investments start to come due, these investments could be materially and adversely affected. in the event of default or potential default under applicable financing arrangements, one or more of our portfolio companies may go bankrupt, which could give rise to substantial investment losses, adverse claims or litigation against us or our employees and damage to our reputation.
among the sectors particularly challenged by downturns in the global credit markets (such as the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009) are the clo and leveraged finance markets. we have significant exposure to these markets through our clo subsidiaries, which we principally acquired in the acquisitions of kfn and avoca. as of december 31, 2018, we indirectly hold below investment grade corporate loans and securities with a $12.7 billion estimated fair market value through our clo subsidiaries. each of these subsidiaries is a special purpose company that issued to us and other investors notes secured by a pool of collateral consisting primarily of corporate leveraged loans. in most cases, our clo holdings are deeply subordinated, representing the clo subsidiary's substantial leverage, which increases both the opportunity for higher returns as well as the magnitude of losses when compared to holders or investors that rank more senior to us in right of payment. these loans and bonds also generally involve a higher degree of risk than investment grade rated debt, including the risks described in the paragraphs above. our clo subsidiaries have historically experienced an increase in downgrades, depreciations in market
61
value and defaults in respect of leveraged loans in their collateral during downturns in credit markets. the clos' portfolio profile tests set limits on the amount of discounted obligations a clo can hold. during any time that a clo issuer exceeds such a limit, the ability of the clo's manager to sell assets and reinvest available principal proceeds into substitute assets is restricted. in such circumstances, clos may fail certain over-collateralization tests, which would cause diversions of cash flows away from us as holders of the more junior clo, which may impact our cash flows. the ability of the clos to make interest payments to the holders of the senior notes of those structures is highly dependent upon the performance of the clo collateral. if the collateral in those structures were to experience a significant decrease in cash flow due to an increased default level, payment of all principal and interest outstanding may be accelerated as a result of an event of default or by holders of the senior notes. there can be no assurance that market conditions giving rise to these types of consequences will not occur, re-occur, subsist or become more acute in the future. because our clo structures involve complex collateral and other arrangements, the documentation for such structures is complex, is subject to differing interpretations and involves legal risk. these clos have served as long-term, non-recourse financing for debt investments and as a way to reduce refinancing risk, reduce maturity risk and secure a fixed cost of funds over an underlying market interest rate. an inability to continue to utilize clos or other similar financing vehicles successfully could limit our ability to fund future investments, grow our business or fully execute our business strategy and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
our clo subsidiaries regularly use significant leverage to finance their assets. an inability of such subsidiaries to continue to raise or utilize leverage, to refinance or extend the maturities of their outstanding indebtedness or to maintain adequate levels of collateral under the terms of their clos could limit their ability to grow their business, reinvest principal cash, distribute cash to us or fully execute their business strategy, and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. if these subsidiaries are unable to maintain their operating results and access to capital resources, they could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. these clo strategies and the value of the assets of such clo subsidiaries are also sensitive to changes in interest rates because these strategies rely on borrowed money and because the value of the underlying portfolio loans can fall when interest rates rise. if interest rates on clo borrowings increase and the interest rates on the portfolio loans do not also increase, the clo strategy is unlikely to achieve its projected returns. also, if interest rates increase in the future, our clo portfolio will likely experience a reduction in value because it would hold assets receiving below market rates of interest.
our credit-oriented funds and clos may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs and regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital. the use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment portfolio. a fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities or debt obligations or may enter into derivative transactions (such as total return swaps) with counterparties that have embedded leverage. the interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities or debt obligations purchased or carried and will be lost-and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated-in the event of a decline in the market value of such securities or debt obligations. gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund's nav to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. however, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund's nav could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings.
any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
the due diligence process that we undertake in connection with our investments may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment.
before making our investments, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. the objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances surrounding an investment, to identify possible risks associated with that investment and, in the case of private equity investments, to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. when conducting due diligence, we typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental, technological, regulatory and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, we rely on resources available to us, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations. the due diligence process may at times be subjective with respect to newly organized companies or carve-out transactions for which only limited information is available.
62
instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions. several of our funds invest in emerging market countries that may not have established laws and regulations that are as stringent as in more developed nations, or where existing laws and regulations may not be consistently enforced. for example, our funds invest throughout jurisdictions that have material perceptions of corruption according to international rating standards (such as transparency international's corruption perceptions index) such as china, india, indonesia, latin america, the middle east and africa. due diligence on investment opportunities in these jurisdictions is frequently more complicated because consistent and uniform commercial practices in such locations may not have developed. bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities and corrupt practices can be especially difficult to detect in such locations.
the due diligence conducted for certain of our credit strategies, as well as certain private equity and real asset investments, is limited to publicly available information. accordingly, we cannot be certain that the due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any investment opportunity will reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity, including the existence of contingent liabilities. we also cannot be certain that our due diligence investigations will result in investments being successful or that the actual financial performance of an investment will not fall short of the financial projections we used when evaluating that investment.
our investment management activities involve investments in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets, and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities for a considerable period of time or lose some or all of the capital invested.
many of our funds and our balance sheet may hold investments in securities that are not publicly traded. in many cases, our funds or we may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities at many points in time. our funds or we will generally not be able to sell these securities publicly unless their sale is registered under applicable securities laws, or unless an exemption from such registration is available, and then only at such times when we do not possess material nonpublic information. the ability of many of our funds or us to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the capital markets and in particular the public equity markets. for example, the ability to realize any value from an investment may depend upon the ability to complete an initial public offering of the portfolio company in which such investment is made. even if the securities are publicly traded, large holdings of securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial length of time, exposing our investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the intended disposition period. moreover, because the investment strategy of many of our funds, particularly our private equity funds, often entails having representation on our funds' public portfolio company boards, our funds may be restricted in their ability to effect such sales during certain time periods. as many of our funds have a finite term, we could also be forced to dispose of investments sooner than otherwise desirable. accordingly, under certain conditions, our funds may be forced to either sell securities at lower prices than they had expected to realize or defer sales that they had planned to make, potentially for a considerable period of time. moreover, we may determine that we may be required to sell our balance sheet assets alongside our funds' investments at such times. we have made and expect to continue to make significant capital investments in our current and future funds and other strategies. contributing capital to these funds is risky, and we may lose some or all of the principal amount of our investments.
our investments are subject to a number of inherent risks.
our results are highly dependent on our continued ability to generate attractive returns from our investments. investments made by our private equity, credit or other investments involve a number of significant risks inherent to private equity, credit and other investing, including the following:
•   companies in which investments are made may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their securities, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of their equity securities or any collateral or guarantees provided with respect to their debt;
•   companies in which investments are made are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of those persons could have a material adverse impact on their business and prospects;
•   companies in which private equity investments are made may be businesses or divisions acquired from larger operating entities that may require a rebuilding or replacement of financial reporting, information technology, operational and other functions;
63
•   companies in which investments are made may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position;
•   instances of bribery, fraud and other deceptive practices committed by senior management of portfolio companies in which our funds or we invest may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies, and if such bribery, fraud or other deceptive practices are discovered, negatively affect the valuation of a fund's investments as well as contribute to overall market volatility that can negatively impact a fund's or our investment program;
•   our funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved, either by expiration of such fund's term or otherwise, resulting in a lower than expected return on the investments and, potentially, on the fund itself;
•   our portfolio companies generally have capital structures established on the basis of financial projections based primarily on management's judgments and assumptions, and general economic conditions and other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of these financial projections, which could cause a substantial decrease in the value of our equity holdings in the portfolio company and cause our funds' or our performance to fall short of our expectations;
•   executive officers, directors and employees of an equity sponsor may be named as defendants in litigation involving a company in which an investment is made or is being made, and we or our funds may indemnify such executive officers, directors or employees for liability relating to such litigation;
•   we advise funds that invest in businesses that operate in a variety of industries that are subject to extensive domestic and foreign regulation (including companies that supply services to governmental agencies), such as the telecommunications industry, the defense and government services industry, the healthcare industry, oil and gas industry, the waste management industry and the food industry, which may involve greater risk due to rapidly changing market and governmental conditions in those sectors;
•   our transactions involve complex tax structuring that could be challenged or disregarded, which may result in losing treaty benefits or would otherwise adversely impact our investments; and
•   significant failures of our portfolio companies to comply with laws and regulations applicable to them could affect the ability of our funds or us to invest in other companies in certain industries in the future and could harm our reputation.
for additional risks that rise from the types of investment vehicles used in an investment, see "-risks related to our business-certain types of investment vehicles may subject us to additional risk of litigation and regulatory scrutiny."
our investments in real assets such as real estate, infrastructure and energy may expose us to increased risks and liabilities and may expose our stockholders to adverse consequences.
investments in real assets, which may include real estate, infrastructure, oil and gas properties and other energy assets, may expose us to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership of real assets. for example:
•   ownership of real assets in our funds or vehicles may increase our risk of liability under environmental laws that impose, regardless of fault, joint and several liability for the cost of remediating contamination and compensation for damages. in addition, changes in environmental laws or regulations or the environmental condition of an investment may create liabilities that did not exist at the time of acquisition that would not have been foreseen. even in cases where we are indemnified by a seller with respect to an investment against liabilities arising out of violations of environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance as to the financial viability of the seller to satisfy such indemnities or our ability to achieve enforcement of such indemnities;
•   ownership of real assets may also present additional risk of liability for personal and property injury or impose significant operating challenges and costs, for example with respect to compliance with zoning, environmental or other applicable laws;
•   real asset investments may face construction risks, including without limitation: (i) labor disputes, shortages of material and skilled labor, or work stoppages; (ii) slower than projected construction progress and the unavailability or late delivery of necessary equipment; (iii) less than optimal coordination with public utilities in the relocation of their facilities; (iv) adverse weather conditions and unexpected construction conditions; (v) accidents or the breakdown or
64
failure of construction equipment or processes; (vi) catastrophic events such as explosions, fires and terrorist activities, and other similar events and (vii) risks associated with holding direct or indirect interests in undeveloped land or underdeveloped real property. these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses (which may exceed expected or forecasted budgets) and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of construction activities once undertaken. certain real asset investments may remain in construction phases for a prolonged period and, accordingly, may not be cash generative for a prolonged period. recourse against the contractor may be subject to liability caps or may be subject to default or insolvency on the part of the contractor;
•   the operation of real assets is exposed to potential unplanned interruptions caused by significant catastrophic or force majeure events. these risks could, among other effects, adversely impact the cash flows available from investments in real assets, cause personal injury or loss of life, damage property, or instigate disruptions of service. in addition, the cost of repairing or replacing damaged assets could be considerable. repeated or prolonged service interruptions may result in permanent loss of customers, litigation, or penalties for regulatory or contractual non-compliance. force majeure events that are incapable of, or too costly to, cure may also have a permanent adverse effect on an investment; and
•   the management of the business or operations of a real asset may be contracted to a third-party management company unaffiliated with us. although it would be possible to replace any such operator, the failure of such an operator to adequately perform its duties or to act in ways that are in the best interest of the investment, or the breach by an operator of applicable agreements or laws, rules and regulations, could have an adverse effect on the investment's results of operations and financial condition. real asset investments may involve the subcontracting of design and construction activities in respect of projects, and as a result our investments are subject to the risk that contractual provisions passing liabilities to a subcontractor could be ineffective, the subcontractor fails to perform services that it has agreed to provide and, in cases where a single subcontractor provides services to various investments, the subcontractor becomes insolvent.
without limiting the foregoing risks, we note that investments that we have made and will continue to make in the oil and gas industries may present specific environmental, safety and other inherent risks. such investments are subject to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations specific to oil and gas industries, including, for example, those governing transportation, exploration and production of oil and natural gas. there are also various conservation laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas production and related operations, in addition to regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment and other practices relating to environmental protection. failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. these laws, ordinances and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible and increase the cost of production, thereby reducing profitability. our oil and gas investments are subject to other risks, such as:
•   volatility in the prices of oil and gas properties may make it difficult to ensure that our acquisition of interest in such properties is at appropriate prices;
•   currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered making it difficult to predict the future costs or impact of compliance;
•   the oil and gas industries present inherent risk of personal and property injury, for which we may not be fully insured or indemnified;
•   there may be unforeseen or increased regulatory and environmental risks stemming from the use of new technologies, including hydraulic fracturing;
•   our estimated oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids reserve quantities and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and value of our reserves;
•   the performance of our energy investments depend on the skill, ability and decisions of third-party operators. the success of our investment will depend on their exploitation, development, construction and drilling activities and the timing and cost of drilling, completing and operating wells. failure of such operators to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in liabilities to us, reduce the value of our interest in the oil and natural gas properties, and materially and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations; and
65
•   if commodity prices decline and remain depressed for a prolonged period, a significant portion of our development projects may become uneconomic and cause write-downs of the value of our oil and gas properties, which may reduce the value of our energy investments, have a negative impact on our ability to use these investments as collateral or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
investments in real estate are subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and real estate-related businesses and assets. these risks include those associated with the burdens of ownership of real property; general and local economic conditions; changes in supply of and demand for competing properties in an area (as a result, for instance, of overbuilding); fluctuations in the average occupancy; the financial resources of tenants; changes in building, environmental and other laws; energy and supply shortages; various uninsured or uninsurable risks; natural disasters; changes in government regulations (such as rent control); changes in real property tax rates; changes in interest rates; the reduced availability of mortgage funds that may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable; negative developments in the economy that depress travel activity; environmental liabilities; contingent liabilities on disposition of assets; and terrorist attacks, war and other factors that are beyond our control. our real estate investments are also subject to additional risks, including but not limited to the following:
•   the success of certain investments will depend on the ability to restructure and effect improvements in the operations of the applicable properties, and there is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or implementing such restructuring programs and improvements.
•   if we acquire direct or indirect interests in undeveloped land or underdeveloped real property, which may often be non-income producing, they will be subject to the risks normally associated with such assets and development activities, including risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory or environmental approvals, the cost and timely completion of construction (including risks beyond the control of us or our fund, such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages) and the availability of both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms.
•   the strategy of our real estate funds may be based, in part, on the availability for purchase of assets at favorable prices followed by the continuation or improvement of market conditions or on the availability of refinancing. no assurance can be given that the real estate businesses or assets can be acquired or disposed of at favorable prices or that refinancing will be available.
•   lenders in commercial real estate financing customarily will require a "bad boy" guarantee, which typically provides that the lender can recover losses from the guarantors for certain bad acts, such as fraud or intentional misrepresentation, intentional waste, willful misconduct, criminal acts, misappropriation of funds, voluntary incurrence of prohibited debt and environmental losses sustained by lender. for our acquisitions, "bad boy" guarantees would generally be extended by our funds, our balance sheet or a combination of both depending on the ownership of the relevant asset. in addition, "bad boy" guarantees typically provide that the loan will be a full personal recourse obligation of the guarantor, for certain actions, such as prohibited transfers of the collateral or changes of control and voluntary bankruptcy of the borrower. it is expected that commercial real estate financing arrangements generally will require "bad boy" guarantees and in the event that such a guarantee is called, a fund's or our assets could be materially and adversely affected. moreover, "bad boy" guarantees could apply to actions of the joint venture partners associated with the investments, and in certain cases the acts of such joint venture partner could result in liability to our funds or us under such guarantees.
•   the acquisition, ownership and disposition of real properties carry certain specific litigation risks. litigation may be commenced with respect to a property acquired in relation to activities that took place prior to the acquisition of such property. in addition, at the time of disposition, other potential buyers may bring claims related to the asset or for due diligence expenses or other damages. after the sale of a real estate asset, buyers may later sue our funds or us for losses associated with latent defects or other problems not uncovered in due diligence.
•   our funds or we may be subject to certain risks associated with investments in particular assets. reits may be affected by changes in the value of their underlying properties and by defaults by borrowers or tenants. reits depend on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions and may be impacted by changes in tax laws or by a failure to qualify for tax-free pass through income. investments in real estate debt investments may be unsecured and subordinated to a substantial amount of indebtedness. such debt investments may not be protected by financial covenants. non-performing real estate loans may require a substantial amount of workout negotiations and/or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial reduction in the interest rate and a substantial write-down of the principal of such loan. investments in commercial mortgage loans are subject to risks of delinquency, foreclosure and loss of principal. in the event of any default under a mortgage loan held directly by our fund or us, our
66
fund or we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the loan. investments in assets or businesses that are distressed may have little or no near-term cash flow and involve a high degree of risk. such investments subject to bankruptcy or insolvency could be subordinated or disallowed.
infrastructure investments often involve an ongoing commitment to a municipal, state, federal or foreign government or regulatory agencies. the nature of these obligations exposes the owners of infrastructure investments to a higher level of regulatory control than typically imposed on other businesses. they may also rely on complex government licenses, concessions, leases or contracts, which may be difficult to obtain or maintain. infrastructure investments may require operators to manage such investments, and such operators' failure to comply with laws, including prohibitions against bribing of government officials, may materially and adversely affect the value of such investments and cause us serious reputational and legal harm. revenues for such investments may rely on contractual agreements for the provision of services with a limited number of counterparties, and are consequently subject to heightened counterparty default risk. the operations and cash flow of infrastructure investments are also more sensitive to inflation and, in certain cases, commodity price risk. furthermore, services provided by infrastructure investments may be subject to rate regulations by government entities that determine or limit prices that may be charged. similarly, users of applicable services, or government entities in response to such users, may react negatively to any adjustments in rates, which may reduce the profitability of such infrastructure investments.
our growth equity strategy invests in emerging and less established companies that are heavily dependent on new technologies.
our growth equity funds may make investments in companies that are in a conceptual or early stage of development. these companies are often characterized by short operating histories, new technologies and products, quickly evolving markets, management teams that may have limited experience working together and in many cases, negative cash flow, all of which enhance the difficulty of evaluating these investment opportunities and the ultimate success of such investments. other substantial operational risks to which such companies are subject include: uncertain market acceptance of the company's products or services; a high degree of regulatory risk for new or untried or untested business models, products and services; high levels of competition among similarly situated companies; new competing products and technology; lower barriers to entry and downward pricing pressure; lower capitalizations and fewer financial resources; the potential for rapid organizational or strategic change; and susceptibility to personal misconduct by or departure of key executives or founders. in addition, growth equity companies may be more susceptible to macroeconomic effects and industry downturns, and their valuations may be more volatile depending on the achievement of milestones, such as receiving a governmental license or approval. growth equity companies also generally depend heavily on intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and proprietary products or processes. the ability to effectively enforce patent, trademark and other intellectual property laws in a cost-effective manner will affect the value of many of these companies. the presence of patents or other intellectual property rights belonging to other parties may lead to the termination of the research and development of a portfolio company's particular product. in addition, if a portfolio company infringes on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, it could be prevented from using certain third-party technologies or forced to acquire licenses in order to obtain access to such technologies at a high cost.
certain of our funds and clos, and our firm through our balance sheet, hold high-yield, below investment grade or unrated debt, or securities of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, which generally entail greater risk, and if those risks are realized, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
certain of our funds and clos, and our firm through our balance sheet, invest in high-yield, below investment grade or unrated debt, including corporate loans and bonds, each of which generally involves a higher degree of risk than investment grade rated debt, and may be less liquid. issuers of high yield, below investment grade or unrated debt may be highly leveraged, and their relatively high debt-to-equity ratios create increased risks that their operations might not generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations. as a result, high yield, below investment grade or unrated debt is often less liquid than investment grade rated debt. also, investments may be made in loans and other forms of debt that are not marketable securities and therefore are not liquid. in the absence of appropriate hedging measures, changes in interest rates generally will also cause the value of fixed rate debt investments to vary inversely to such changes. the obligor of a debt security or instrument may not be able or willing to pay interest or to repay principal when due in accordance with the terms of the associated agreement and collateral may not be available or sufficient to cover such liabilities. commercial bank lenders and other creditors may be able to contest payments to the holders of other debt obligations of the same obligor in the event of default under their commercial bank loan agreements. sub-participation interests in syndicated debt may be subject to certain risks as a result of having no direct contractual relationship with underlying borrowers. debt securities and instruments may be rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies or unrated and face ongoing uncertainties and exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions and the issuer's failure to make timely interest and principal payments.
67
certain of our investment funds, especially in our special situations strategy, and our firm through our balance sheet may hold interests in business enterprises involved in work-outs, liquidations, reorganizations, bankruptcies and similar transactions and may purchase high-risk receivables. an investment in such business enterprises entails the risk that the transaction in which such business enterprise is involved either will be unsuccessful, will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the purchase price to the fund of the security or other financial instrument in respect of which such distribution is received. in addition, if an anticipated transaction does not in fact occur, we or the fund may be required to sell the investment at a loss. investments in troubled companies may also be adversely affected by u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. laws relating to, among other things, fraudulent conveyances, voidable preferences, lender liability and a bankruptcy court's discretionary power to disallow, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims. investments in securities and private claims of troubled companies made in connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in a bankruptcy case may also involve substantial litigation, which has the potential to adversely impact us or unrelated funds or portfolio companies. companies that were not in financial distress at the time we or our funds made investments may in the future require work-outs, liquidations, reorganizations, bankruptcies or similar transactions, and as a result, become subject to the same risks described above. because there is substantial uncertainty concerning the outcome of transactions involving financially troubled companies, there is a potential risk of loss of the entire investment in such company. such investments involve a substantial degree of risk, and a decline in value of the assets would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.
we often pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal or other complexities.
as an element of our investment style, we often pursue complex investment opportunities. this can often take the form of substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity that would deter other investment managers. our tolerance for complexity presents risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time consuming to finance and execute; it can be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions; and such transactions sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny, the application of complex tax laws or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. our transactions involve complex tax structures that are costly to establish, monitor and maintain, and as we pursue a larger number of transactions across multiple assets classes and in multiple jurisdictions, such costs will increase and the risk that a tax matter is overlooked or inadequately or inconsistently addressed will increase. consequently, we may fail to achieve the desired tax benefit or otherwise decrease the returns of our investments or damage the reputation of our firm. changes in law and regulation and in the enforcement of existing law and regulation, such as antitrust laws and tax laws, also add complexity and risk to our business. further, we, directly or through our funds, may acquire an investment that is subject to contingent liabilities, which could be unknown to us at the time of acquisition or, if they are known to us, we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present. acquired contingent liabilities could thus result in unforeseen losses for us or our funds. in addition, in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company, we or a fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. we or a fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations are inaccurate. these arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities by us or a fund, even after the disposition of an investment. any of these risks could harm the performance of us or our funds.
our private equity investments are typically among the largest in the industry, which involves certain complexities and risks that are not encountered in small- and medium-sized investments.
our private equity funds make investments in companies with relatively large capitalizations, which involves certain complexities and risks that are not encountered in small- and medium-sized investments. for example, larger transactions may be more difficult to finance and exiting larger deals may present incremental challenges. in addition, larger transactions may pose greater challenges in implementing changes in the company's management, culture, finances or operations, and may entail greater scrutiny by regulators, interest groups and other third parties. these constituencies may be more active in opposing larger investments by certain private equity firms.
in some transactions, the amount of equity capital that is required to complete a large capitalization private equity transaction may be significant and are required to be structured as a consortium transaction. a consortium transaction involves an equity investment in which two or more private equity firms serve together or collectively as equity sponsors. while we have sought to limit where possible the amount of consortium transactions in which we have been involved, we have participated in a significant number of those transactions. consortium transactions generally entail a reduced level of control by our firm over the investment because governance rights must be shared with the other consortium investors. accordingly, we may not be able to control decisions relating to a consortium investment, including decisions relating to the management and operation of the company and the timing and nature of any exit, which could result in the risks described in "-we and our funds have made investments in companies that we do not control, exposing us to the risk of decisions made by others with which we may not agree." any of these factors could increase the risk that our larger investments could be less successful. the consequences to
68
our investment funds of an unsuccessful larger investment could be more severe given the size of the investment. moreover, we have significant capital of our own committed in such large investments. for certain large private equity transactions, we may seek to syndicate a portion of our capital commitment to third parties; however, if we are unable to syndicate all or part of such commitment, we may be required to fund the remaining commitment amount from our balance sheet. if we are required to keep on our balance sheet a large portion of the capital commitment that could not be syndicated to third parties, poor performance of such large investment may have a material adverse impact on our financial results. see "-risks related to our business-if we are unable to syndicate the securities or indebtedness or realize returns on investments financed with our balance sheet assets, our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected" and "-our funds and our firm through our balance sheet may make a limited number of investments, or investments that are concentrated in certain issuers, geographic regions or asset types, which could negatively affect our performance or the performance of our funds to the extent those concentrated assets perform poorly."
we and our funds have made investments in companies that we do not control, exposing us to the risk of decisions made by others with which we may not agree.
we and our funds hold investments that include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control, and such investments may comprise an increasing part of our business. such instruments and securities may be acquired by our funds through trading activities or through purchases of securities from the issuer or we may purchase such instruments and securities on a principal basis. in addition, our funds may acquire minority equity interests, particularly when making private equity investments in asia, making growth equity investments or sponsoring investments as part of a large investor consortium or through many of our credit funds. our funds may also dispose of a portion of their majority equity investments in portfolio companies over time in a manner that results in the funds retaining a minority investment. we and our funds, including our newer private equity funds, have made certain minority investments in publicly traded companies.
we have also made minority investments in companies including hedge fund managers on our balance sheet. for example, we have investments in marshall wace, blackgold and paamco prisma. we also have investments in real estate managers like drawbridge realty and german estate group ag.
transactions made by companies we do not control could be viewed as unwanted, damage our reputation, and consequently impair our ability to source transactions in the future. those investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. these companies may be subject to complex regulatory requirements and instances of non-compliance by them may subject us to reputational harm or in certain cases, liability. we are also reliant on the systems and processes of these companies for, among other, financial information and valuations of our investments in or with them, including hedge fund managers and their funds, but we do not control the decisions and judgments made during such processes. our investments in hedge fund managers may subject us to additional regulatory complexities or scrutiny if we are deemed to control the company for regulatory purposes, despite our minority interest. these asset managers may also be dependent on their founders and other key persons, and the loss of these key personnel could adversely impact our investment. if any of the foregoing were to occur, the value of the investments held by our funds or by us could decrease and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.
we make investments in companies that are based outside of the united states, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the united states.
many of our funds invest or have the flexibility to invest a significant portion of their assets in the equity, debt, loans or other securities of issuers that are based outside of the united states. a substantial amount of these investments consist of private equity investments made by our private equity funds and growth equity funds. for example, as of december 31, 2018, approximately 49% of the capital invested in those funds (european fund and subsequent funds) was attributable to non-u.s. investments. investing in companies that are based or have significant operations in countries outside of the united states and, in particular, in emerging markets such as china and india, eastern europe, south and southeast asia, latin america and africa, involves risks and considerations that are not typically associated with investments in companies established in the united states. these risks may include the following:
•   the possibility of exchange control regulations;
•   restrictions on repatriation of profit on investments or of capital invested;
•   the imposition of non-u.s. taxes and changes in tax law;
69
•   differences in the legal and regulatory environment, such as the recognition of information barriers, or enhanced legal and regulatory compliance;
•   greater levels of corruption and potential exposure to the fcpa and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials and other third parties;
•   violations of trade sanctions or trade control regimes;
•   limitations on borrowings to be used to fund acquisitions or dividends;
•   limitations on permissible counterparties in our transactions or consolidation rules that effectively restrict the types of businesses in which we may invest;
•   political risks generally, including political and social instability, nationalization, expropriation of assets or political hostility to investments by foreign or private equity investors;
•   less liquid markets;
•   reliance on a more limited number of commodity inputs, service providers and/or distribution mechanisms;
•   adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another;
•   higher rates of inflation;
•   less available current information about an issuer;
•   higher transaction costs;
•   less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers;
•   less developed bankruptcy and other laws;
•   greater application of concepts like equitable subordination, which may, in bankruptcy or insolvency, result in the subordination of debt or other senior interests held by our investment funds, vehicles or accounts in companies in which our investment funds, vehicles or accounts also hold equity interests;
•   difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations;
•   lack of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards;
•   less stringent requirements relating to fiduciary duties;
•   fewer investor protections; and
•   greater price volatility.
as a result of the complexity of and lack of clear laws, precedent or authority with respect to the application of various income tax laws to our structures, the application of rules governing how transactions and structures should be reported is also subject to differing interpretations. in particular, certain jurisdictions have either proposed or adopted rules that seek to limit the amount of interest that may be deductible where the lender and the borrower are related parties (or where third-party borrowings have been guaranteed by a related party) and in some cases, without regard to whether the lender is a related party, or may seek to interpret existing rules in a more restrictive manner. in addition, the tax authorities of certain countries have sought to disallow tax deductions for transaction and certain other costs at the portfolio company level either on the basis that the entity claiming the deduction does not benefit from the costs incurred or on other grounds. these measures will most likely adversely affect portfolio companies in those jurisdictions in which our investment funds have investments, and limit the benefits of additional investments in those countries. our business is also subject to the risk that similar measures might be introduced in other countries in which our investment funds currently have investments or plan to invest in the future, or that
70
other legislative or regulatory measures that negatively affect their respective portfolio investments might be promulgated in any of the countries in which they invest.
in addition, certain countries such as australia, china, india, japan, brazil and south korea, where we have made investments, have sought to tax investment gains derived by nonresident investors, including private equity funds, from the disposition of the equity in companies operating in those countries. in some cases this development is the result of new legislation or changes in the interpretation of existing legislation and local authority assertions that investors have a local taxable presence or are holding companies for trading purposes rather than for capital purposes, or are not otherwise entitled to treaty benefits.
further, the tax authorities in certain countries, such as australia, belgium, china, india, japan, denmark, germany and south korea have sought to deny the benefits of income tax treaties or eu directives with respect to withholding taxes on interest and dividends and capital gains of nonresident entities. benefits of income tax treaties or eu directives could be denied under each country's general anti-avoidance rules or on the basis that the entity benefiting from such treaty or directive is not the owner of the income, is a mere conduit inserted primarily to access treaty benefits or directives, or otherwise lacks substance.
these various proposals and initiatives could result in an increase in taxes paid by our funds and/or increased tax withholding with respect to our fund investors. see "-risks related to our business-changes in relevant tax laws, regulations or treaties or an adverse interpretation of these items by tax authorities could adversely impact our effective tax rate and tax liability."
as a result of the complexity of our structures, foreign jurisdictions may seek to tax an additional portion of the fee income associated with our management advisory activity. foreign jurisdictions may assert that an additional amount of fee income is subject to local tax, potentially reducing our profits associated with such income, although this risk may be mitigated by the availability of foreign tax credits. we or our funds may also inadvertently establish a taxable presence in a jurisdiction because of activities conducted there. compliance with tax laws and structures in these jurisdictions and the costs of adapting to changes in tax policies require significant oversight and cost.
although we expect that much of the capital commitments of our funds will be denominated in u.s. dollars, our investments and capital commitments that are denominated in a foreign currency, such as euro, will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. a depreciation of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, if not adequately hedged, would reduce the value of our investments in the relevant region, which could adversely impact our financial results. factors that may affect currency values include trade balances, the ability of countries to pay their national debt, levels of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. we may employ hedging techniques to reduce these risks, but we can offer no assurance that such strategies will be effective or even available at all. if we engage in hedging transactions, we may be exposed to additional risks associated with such transactions. see "-risk management activities may adversely affect the return on our investments." in addition, various countries and regulatory bodies may implement controls on foreign exchange and outbound remittances of currency, which could impact not only the timing and amount of capital contributions that are required to be made to our funds but also the value, in u.s. dollars, of our investments and investment proceeds. see "risks related to our business-difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition" and "risks related to our business-extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business." see also "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-business environment" for a discussion of recent developments in market and business conditions that may affect our business.
third-party investors in our funds with commitment-based structures may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested by us, which could adversely affect a fund's operations and performance.
investors in certain of our funds make capital commitments to those funds that the funds are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. we depend on fund investors fulfilling their commitments when we call capital from them in order for such funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations (for example, management fees) when due. any fund investor that did not fund a capital call would generally be subject to several possible penalties, including having a significant amount of existing investment forfeited in that fund. however, the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has invested little
71
or no capital, for instance early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. investors may in the future also negotiate for lesser or reduced penalties at the outset of the fund, thereby inhibiting our ability to enforce the funding of a capital call. if our fund investors were to fail to satisfy a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds, the operation and performance of those funds could be materially and adversely affected.
our equity investments and many of our debt investments often rank junior to investments made by others, exposing us to greater risk of losing our investment.
in many cases, the companies in which we or our funds invest have, or are permitted to have, outstanding indebtedness or equity securities that rank senior to our or our fund's investment. by their terms, such instruments may provide that their holders are entitled to receive payments of distributions, interest or principal on or before the dates on which payments are to be made in respect of our or our fund's investment. also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made, holders of securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our investment. in addition, debt investments made by us or our funds in our portfolio companies may be equitably subordinated to the debt investments made by third parties in our portfolio companies. after repaying senior security holders, the company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying amounts owed in respect of our investment. to the extent that any assets remain, holders of claims that rank equally with our investment would be entitled to share on an equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of those assets. also, during periods of financial distress or following insolvency, the ability of us or our funds to influence a company's affairs and to take actions to protect an investment may be substantially less than that of the senior creditors.
risk management activities may adversely affect the return on our investments.
when managing exposure to market risks, we employ hedging strategies or certain forms of derivative instruments to limit our exposure to changes in the relative values of investments that may result from market developments, including changes in prevailing interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. the scope of risk management activities undertaken by us is selective and varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates, prevailing foreign currency exchange rates, the types of investments that are made and other changing market conditions. we do not seek to hedge our exposure in all currencies or all investments, which means that our exposure to certain market risks are not limited. where applicable, we use hedging transactions and other derivative instruments to reduce the effects of a decline in the value of a position, but they do not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the value of the position or prevent losses if the value of the position declines. however, such activities can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of the position. such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a position increases. moreover, it may not be possible to limit the exposure to a market development that is so generally anticipated that a hedging or other derivative transaction cannot be entered into at an acceptable price.
the success of any hedging or other derivative transactions that we enter into generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market changes. as a result, while we may enter into such transactions in order to reduce our exposure to market risks, unanticipated market changes may result in poorer overall investment performance than if the hedging or other derivative transaction had not been executed. in addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in connection with hedging activities and price movements in a position being hedged may vary. moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek or be successful in establishing a perfect correlation between the instruments used in hedging or other derivative transactions and the positions being hedged. an imperfect correlation could prevent us from achieving the intended result and could give rise to a loss. in addition, it may not be possible to fully or perfectly limit our exposure against all changes in the value of its investments, because the value of investments is likely to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which will be beyond our control or ability to hedge.
while hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks. these arrangements may require the posting of cash collateral, including at a time when a fund has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that the posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices that do not reflect their underlying value. moreover, these hedging arrangements may generate significant transaction costs, including potential tax costs, that reduce the returns generated by a fund. the cftc has proposed or adopted regulations governing swaps and security-based swaps, which may limit our trading activities and our ability to implement effective hedging strategies or increase the costs of compliance. see "risks related to our business-extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business."
72
our funds and our firm through our balance sheet may make a limited number of investments, or investments that are concentrated in certain issuers, geographic regions or asset types, which could negatively affect our performance or the performance of our funds to the extent those concentrated assets perform poorly.
the governing agreements of our funds contain only limited investment restrictions and only limited requirements as to diversification of fund investments, either by geographic region or asset type. our private equity funds generally permit up to 20% of the fund to be invested in a single company. we also advise funds that invest in a single industry such as growth equity, energy, infrastructure or real estate or funds that focus on particular geographic region. during periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns in these sectors or geographic regions, decreased revenues, difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs may be exacerbated by this concentration of investments, which would result in lower investment returns. because a significant portion of a fund's capital may be invested in a single investment or portfolio company, a loss with respect to such investment or portfolio company could have a material adverse impact on such fund's capital. accordingly, a lack of diversification on the part of a fund could materially and adversely affect a fund's performance and therefore, our results of operations and financial condition.
similarly, our balance sheet has significant exposures to certain issuers, industries or asset classes. because we hold interests in some of our portfolio companies both through our balance sheet investments in our private equity funds and direct co-investments, fluctuation in the fair values of these portfolio companies may have a disproportionate impact on the investment income earned by us as compared to other portfolio companies. in these circumstances, as was the case with energy investments beginning in late 2014 through and into 2018, losses may have an even greater impact on our results of operations and financial condition, as we would directly bear the full extent of such losses. our balance sheet also has significant exposures to a small group of companies, with our investment in first data corporation (nyse: fdc) representing approximately 10.1% and our top five investments representing approximately 26.3% of our balance sheet's total investments as of december 31, 2018. as a result, our investment income is subject to greater volatility depending on such companies' operating results and other idiosyncratic factors specific to such companies, and in the case of publicly traded companies, our operating results would be impacted by volatility in the public markets generally and in the stock price of such companies. see "-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-segment analysis-segment balance sheet" for information on significant investments held on our balance sheet.
our business activities may give rise to a conflict of interest with our funds.
as we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our businesses, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to investment activities among our various funds and also our own account. for example:
•   in pursuing the interest of our fund investors, we may take actions that could reduce our aum or our profits that we could otherwise realize in the short term;
•   we may be required to allocate investment opportunities among investment vehicles that may have overlapping investment objectives, including vehicles that may have different fee structures, and among kkr co-investment vehicles (including vehicles in which kkr employees may investment) and third-party co-investors;
•   we may, on behalf of our funds or kkr itself, buy, sell, hold or otherwise deal with securities or other investments that may be purchased, sold or held by our other funds or that are otherwise issued by a portfolio company in which our funds invest. conflicts of interest may arise between a fund, on one hand, and kkr on the other or among our funds including but not limited to those relating to the purchase or sale of investments, the structuring of, or exercise of rights with respect to investment transactions and the advice we provide to our funds. for example we may sell an investment at a different time or for different consideration than our funds;
•   we may invest on behalf of our fund or for our own account in a portfolio company of one fund that is a competitor, service provider, supplier, customer, or other counterparty with respect to a portfolio company of another fund;
•   we may structure an investment in a manner that may be attractive to fund investors or to kkr holdings from a tax perspective even though kkr is required to pay corporate taxes;
•   a decision to acquire material non-public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund or our own account may result in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action with regards to that company or its securities;
•   our fiduciary obligations to our fund investors may preclude us from pursuing attractive proprietary investment opportunities, in particular as we enter into strategic relationships with broad investment mandates similar to the
73
investments we make with our balance sheet. notwithstanding the foregoing, we also allocate certain investments that we believe are not suitable for our funds to our balance sheet;
•   conflicts may arise in allocating investments, time, services, expenses or resources among the investment activities of our funds, kkr, other kkr-affiliated entities and the employees of kkr;
•   our principals have made personal investments in a variety of our investment funds, which may result in conflicts of interest among investors of our funds or stockholders regarding investment decisions for these funds;
•   the general partner's entitlement to receive carried interest from many of our funds may create an incentive for that general partner to make riskier and more speculative investments on behalf of a fund than would be the case in the absence of such an arrangement. in addition, for our funds that pay carried interest based on accrued rather than realized gains, the amount of carried interest to which the general partner is entitled and the timing of its receipt of carried interest will depend on the valuation by the general partner of the fund's investment;
•   under the 2017 tax act, investments must be held for more than three years, rather than the prior requirement of more than one year, for carried interest to be treated for u.s. federal income tax purposes as capital gain, which may create a conflict of interest between the limited partner investors (whose investments would receive such capital gain treatment after a holding period of only one year) and the general partner on the execution, closing or timing of sales of a fund's investments in connection with the receipt of carried interest;
•   from time to time, one of our funds or other investment vehicles (including clos) may seek to effect a purchase or sale of an investment with one or more of our other funds or other investment vehicles in a so-called "cross transaction," or we as a principal may seek to effect a purchase or sale of our investment with one or more of our funds or other investment vehicles in a so-called "principal transaction";
•   a dispute may arise between our portfolio companies, and if such dispute is not resolved amicably or results in litigation, it could cause significant reputational harm to us, and our fund investors may become dissatisfied with our handling of the dispute;
•   the investors in our investment vehicles are based in a wide variety of jurisdictions and take a wide variety of forms, and consequently have diverging interests among themselves from a regulatory, tax or legal perspective or with respect to investment policies and target risk/return profiles; and
•   we or our affiliates, including our capital markets business, may receive fees or other compensation in connection with specific transactions or different clients that may give rise to conflicts. the decision to take on an opportunity in one of our businesses may, as a practical matter, also limit the ability of one or our other businesses to take advantage of other related opportunities.
in addition, our funds also invest in a broad range of asset classes throughout the corporate capital structure. these investments include investments in corporate loans and debt securities, preferred equity securities and common equity securities. in certain cases, we may manage separate funds that invest in different parts of the same company's capital structure. for example, our credit funds may invest in different classes of the same company's debt and may make debt investments in a company that is owned by one of our private equity funds. in those cases, the interests of our funds may not always be aligned, which could create actual or potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts. for example, one of our private equity funds could have an interest in pursuing an acquisition, divestiture or other transaction that, in its judgment, could enhance the value of the private equity investment, even though the proposed transaction would subject one of our credit fund's debt investments to additional or increased risks. finally, our ability to effectively implement a public securities strategy may be limited to the extent that contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of our private equity business impose restrictions on our engaging in transactions that we may be interested in otherwise pursuing.
we may also cause different investment funds to invest in a single portfolio company, for example where the fund that made an initial investment no longer has capital available to invest. conflicts may also arise where we make balance sheet investments for our own account or permit employees to invest alongside our investment vehicles or our balance sheet for their own account. in certain cases, we may require that a transaction or investment be approved by fund investors or their advisory committees, be approved by an independent valuation expert, be subject to a fairness opinion, be based on arm's-length pricing data or be calculated in accordance with a formula provided for in a fund's governing documents prior to the completion of the relevant transaction or investment to address potential conflicts of interest. such instances include principal transactions where we or our affiliates warehouse an investment in a portfolio company for the benefit of one or more of our funds pending the
74
contribution of committed capital by the investors in such funds, follow-on investments by a fund other than a fund that made an initial investment in a company, or transactions in which we arrange for one of our funds to buy a security from, or sell a security to, another one of our funds.
appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and we could suffer reputational damage or potential liability if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts as they arise. regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation which could in turn materially and adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including as a result of an inability to raise additional funds and a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us.
investors in certain funds in our public markets business line may redeem their investments in these funds with minimal notice.
investors in our funds in certain of our leveraged credit investment vehicles may generally submit redemptions to redeem their investments on a quarterly or monthly basis following the expiration of a specified period of time or in certain cases capital may be withdrawn earlier subject to a fee, in each case subject to the applicable fund's specific redemption provisions. factors that could result in investors leaving our funds include changes in interest rates that make other investments more attractive, changes in or rebalancing due to investors' asset allocation policy, changes in investor perception regarding our focus or alignment of interest, unhappiness with a fund's performance or investment strategy, changes in our reputation, departures or changes in responsibilities of key investment professionals, and performance and liquidity needs of fund investors. in a declining market or period of economic disruption or uncertainty, the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our aum could accelerate. the decrease in revenues that would result from significant redemptions from our funds or other similar investment vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, net income and cash flows.
a portion of assets invested in our funds in the public markets business line are managed through separately managed accounts or entities structured for investment by one investor or related investors whereby we earn management and incentive fees, and we intend to continue to seek additional separately managed account or single entity mandates. the investment management agreements we enter into in connection with managing separately managed accounts or entities on behalf of certain clients may be terminated by such clients on as little as 30 days' prior written notice, or less in certain prescribed circumstances. in addition, the boards of directors of certain funds we manage could terminate our advisory engagement of those companies, on as little as 30 days' prior written notice. similarly, we provide sub-advisory services to other investment advisors and managers. such investment advisors and managers could terminate our sub-advisory agreements on as little as 30 days' prior written notice. in the case of any such terminations, the management and incentive fees we earn in connection with managing such account or company would immediately cease, which could result in a material adverse impact on our revenues.
in addition, certain funds in our public markets business line are registered under the investment company act as management investment companies. these funds and kkr credit advisors (us) llc, which serves as their investment adviser, are subject to the investment company act and the rules thereunder. one of these funds is a nyse-listed closed-end fund. bdcs in our bdc platform are also registered under the investment company act, including fs kkr capital corp., a bdc listed on the nyse. in addition, the management fees we are paid for managing investment companies will generally be subject to contractual rights the company's board of directors (or, in the case of the bdcs, the investment adviser) has to terminate our management of an account on as short as 60 days' prior notice. termination of these agreements would reduce the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
our stakes in our hedge fund partnerships subject us to numerous additional risks.
our stakes in our hedge fund partnerships subject us to numerous additional risks applicable to hedge funds and funds of funds, including the following:
•   generally, there are few limitations on the execution of investment strategies of a hedge fund or fund of funds, which are subject to the sole discretion of the management company or the general partner of such funds;
•   a fund of funds is subject to risks related to the limited rights it has to withdraw, redeem, transfer or otherwise liquidate its investments from the underlying hedge funds or other funds in which it invests. it may be impossible or costly for hedge funds or such other funds to liquidate positions rapidly in order to meet margin calls, withdrawal requests, redemption requests or otherwise, particularly if there are other market participants seeking to dispose of similar assets at the same time or the relevant market is otherwise moving against a position or in the event of trading halts or daily price movement limits on the market or otherwise. in addition, terms of the governing documents of the
75
relevant portfolio funds may limit withdrawal, redemption, transfer or liquidation of investments, including restrictions on the redemption of capital for an initial period, restrictions on the amount of redemptions and the frequency with which redemptions can be made and investment minimums that must be maintained. portfolio funds also typically reserve the right to reduce ("gate") or suspend redemptions, to set aside ("side pocket") capital that cannot be redeemed for so long as an event or circumstance has not occurred or ceased to exist, respectively, and to satisfy redemptions by making distributions in-kind, under certain circumstances. moreover, these risks may be exacerbated for funds of funds. for example, if a fund of funds were to invest a significant portion of its assets in two or more hedge funds that each had illiquid positions in the same issuer, the illiquidity risk for such fund of funds would be compounded.
•   hedge funds may engage in short selling, which is subject to theoretically unlimited loss, in that the price of the underlying security could theoretically increase without limit, thus increasing the cost of buying those securities to cover the short position. there can be no assurance that the security necessary to cover a short position will be available for purchase. purchasing securities to close out the short position can itself cause the prices of the securities to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss;
•   hedge funds may enter into cds as investments or hedges. cds involve greater risks than investing in the reference obligation directly. in addition to general market risks, cds are subject to risks related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, credit quality and expected recovery rates of the underlying credit instrument;
•   hedge funds are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus causing the fund to suffer a loss. counterparty risk is accentuated for contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to prevent settlement, or where the fund has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties. generally, hedge funds are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. moreover, the fund's internal consideration of the creditworthiness of their counterparties may prove insufficient. the absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses;
•   the efficacy of investment and trading strategies depends largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments. a hedge fund's trading orders may not be executed in a timely and efficient manner due to various circumstances, including systems failures or human error. in such event, the funds might only be able to acquire some but not all of the components of the position, or if the overall position were to need adjustment, the funds might not be able to make such adjustment. as a result, the funds would not be able to achieve the market position selected by the management company or general partner of such funds, and might incur a loss in liquidating their position;
•   hedge funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved, either by expiration of such fund's term or otherwise. although we generally expect that investments will be disposed of prior to dissolution or be suitable for in-kind distribution at dissolution, these funds may have to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of dissolution. this would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself;
•   hedge funds may rely on computer programs, internal infrastructure and services, quantitative models (both proprietary models and those supplied by third parties) and information and data provided by third parties to trade, clear and settle securities and other transactions, among other activities, that are critical to the oversight of certain funds' activities. if any such models, information or data prove to be incorrect or incomplete, any decisions made in reliance thereon could expose the funds to potential risks. any hedging based on faulty models, information or data may prove to be unsuccessful and adversely impact a fund's profits; and
•   hedge fund investments are also subject to risks relating to investments in commodities, futures, options and other derivatives, the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to the theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances, including if the fund writes a call option. price movements of commodities, futures and options contracts and payments pursuant to swap agreements are influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments and national and international political and economic events and policies. the value of futures, options and swap agreements also depends upon the price of the commodities underlying them. in addition, hedge funds' assets are subject to the risk of the failure of any of the exchanges on which their positions trade or of their clearinghouses or counterparties. most u.s. commodities exchanges limit fluctuations in certain commodity interest prices during a single day by imposing "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits," the existence of which may reduce liquidity or
76
effectively curtail trading in particular markets. hedge funds and funds of these hedge funds may also be subject to extensive regulations, including those of cftc.
to the extent the financial condition of paamco prisma or other third-party hedge fund managers with which we have hedge fund partnerships is adversely affected by these risks, our revenues, aum and fpaum may also decline.
risks related to our common stock our class a common stock is generally non-voting, except as provided in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or required by delaware law or the rules of the nyse.
holders of our class a common stock generally have no voting rights, unless provided in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or required by delaware law or the rules of the nyse. as a result, practically all matters submitted to stockholders will be decided by the vote of the holder of the sole share of the class b stockholder. our certificate of incorporation provides for holders of our class a common stock, voting together with the holders of our class c common stock as a single class, unless required otherwise by delaware law, to have the right to vote only with respect to any increase in the number of authorized shares of class b common stock, certain sales of all or substantially all of our assets, a merger, consolidation or other business combination and any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that would have a material adverse effect on our class a common stock relative to the other classes of our stock. our certificate of incorporation also provides that the number of authorized shares of our class a common stock may be increased solely with the approval of the class b stockholder. as a result, holders of our class a common stock will have very limited or no ability to influence stockholder decisions, including decisions regarding our business.
the voting rights of holders of our class a common stock are further restricted by provisions in our certificate of incorporation stating that any of our shares of stock held by a person that beneficially owns 20% or more of any class of stock then outstanding (other than the class b stockholder or its affiliates, or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of the class b stockholder or its affiliates) cannot be voted on any matter. kkr holdings, the holder of our class c common stock, is exempt from this limitation. our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws also contain provisions limiting the ability of the holders of our class a common stock to call meetings, to acquire information about our operations and to influence the manner or direction of our management.
these limits on the ability of the holders of the class a common stock to exercising voting rights restrict the ability of the holders of our class a common stock to influence matters subject to the vote of our stockholders.
as a "controlled company," we qualify for some exemptions from the corporate governance and other requirements of the nyse.
we are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the nyse. as a "controlled company" we have elected not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the nyse, including the requirements: (i) that the listed company have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors, (ii) that the listed company have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (iii) that the compensation committee be required to consider certain independence factors when engaging compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisers. accordingly, holders of our class a common stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse.
our founders are able to significantly influence the outcome of any matter that may be submitted for a vote of holders of our class a common stock.
to the extent that any matters are required to be submitted to a vote of the holders of our class a common stock, they will generally require the approval of a majority or more of all the outstanding designated stock, which currently consists of our class a common stock and class c common stock voting together. matters that require a vote of a majority or more of all outstanding designated stock include any increase in the number of authorized shares of class b common stock, certain sales of all or substantially all of our assets, a merger, consolidation or other business combination and any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that would have a material adverse effect on our class a common stock relative to the other classes of our stock. as a result, the holders of our class c common stock will vote on an equivalent basis with the holders of our class a common stock on such matters. as of february 12, 2019, kkr holdings owned 299,081,239 shares of class c common stock, representing approximately 35.9% of the total combined voting power of the class a common stock and class c common
77
stock, taken together. this voting power may be sufficient to substantially influence matters subject to a vote of our outstanding designated stock, including amendments that could materially and adversely affect the holders of our class a common stock.
because our class a common stock is generally non-voting, we are not required to comply with certain provisions of u.s. securities laws relating to proxy statements and other annual meeting materials.
our class a common stock is registered under section 12 of the exchange act and is generally non-voting. as a result, we are not be required to file proxy statements or information statements under section 14 of the exchange act, unless a vote of holders of our class a common stock is required by applicable law or the rules of the nyse. accordingly, legal causes of action and remedies under section 14 of the exchange act for inadequate or misleading information in proxy statements will not generally be available to holders of our class a common stock. if we do not deliver any proxy statements, information statements, annual reports, and other information and reports to the class b stockholder, then we will similarly not provide any of this information to the holders of our class a common stock. in addition, we will generally not be subject to the "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency" provisions of the dodd-frank act. as a result, our stockholders will not have an opportunity to provide a non-binding vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. moreover, holders of our class a common stock will be unable to bring matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or nominate directors at such meeting, nor can they generally submit stockholder proposals under rule 14a-8 of the exchange act.
our certificate of incorporation states that the class b stockholder is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the other stockholders and contains provisions limiting the liability of the class b stockholder.
our class a common stock is generally non-voting. as a result, all or nearly all matters required to be submitted to stockholders will be determined solely by the vote of the class b stockholder. subject to applicable law, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions limiting the duties owed by the class b stockholder and contains provisions allowing the class b stockholder to favor its own interests and the interests of its controlling persons over us and the holders of our class a common stock. our certificate of incorporation contains provisions stating that the class b stockholder is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the other stockholders (including the tax consequences to such stockholders) in deciding whether or not to authorize us to take (or decline to authorize us to take) any action as well as provisions stating that the class b stockholder shall not be liable to the other stockholders for damages or equitable relief for any losses, liabilities or benefits not derived by such stockholders in connection with such decisions. see "-potential conflicts of interest may arise among the class b stockholder and the holders of our class a common stock."
the class b stockholder will not be liable to kkr or holders of our class a common stock for any acts, or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment determining that the class b stockholder acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct and we have also agreed to indemnify the class b stockholder to a similar extent.
even if there is deemed to be a breach of the obligations set forth in our certificate of incorporation, our certificate of incorporation provides that the class b stockholder will not be liable to us or the holders of our class a common stock for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the class b stockholder or its officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. these provisions are detrimental to the holders of our class a common stock because they restrict the remedies available to stockholders for actions of the class b stockholder.
in addition, we have agreed to indemnify the class b stockholder and its affiliates and any member, partner, tax matters partner (as defined in u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), as in effect prior to 2018), partnership representative (as defined in the code), officer, director, employee agent, fiduciary or trustee of any of kkr or its subsidiaries, any kkr group partnership, the class b stockholder or any of our or the class b stockholder's affiliates and certain other specified persons (collectively, the "indemnitees"), to the fullest extent permitted by law, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts incurred by any indemnitee. we have agreed to provide this indemnification unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. we have also agreed to provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings.
the provision of our certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the court of chancery in the state of delaware for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and stockholders.
our certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that any claims, suits, actions or proceedings arising out of or relating in any way to our certificate of incorporation may only be brought in the court of
78
chancery of the state of delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, any other court in the state of delaware with subject matter jurisdiction. this provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and stockholders.
the market price and trading volume of our class a common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our class a common stockholders.
the market price of our class a common stock may be highly volatile, could be subject to wide fluctuations and could decline significantly in the future. in addition, the trading volume in our class a common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. if the market price of our class a common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to sell your shares at an attractive price, if at all. some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our class a common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our class a common stock include:
•   variations in our quarterly operating results, including the accrual and payment of corporate taxes following the conversion, which may be substantial;
•   changes in the amount of our dividends or our dividend policy;
•   taking a long-term perspective on making investment, operational and strategic decisions, which may result in significant and unpredictable variations in our quarterly returns;
•   failure to meet analysts' earnings estimates;
•   publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our class a common stock sufficiently;
•   additions or departures of our key management and investment personnel;
•   adverse market reaction to any acquisitions, joint ventures, reorganizations and other transactions, including incurrence of debt or issuance of securities in the future;
•   changes in market valuations of similar companies;
•   speculation in the press or investment community;
•   changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;
•   a concentrated ownership of our class a common stock or ownership by short-term investors;
•   a lack of liquidity in the trading of our class a common stock;
•   adverse publicity about the investment management or private equity industry generally or individual scandals, specifically; and
•   general market and economic conditions.
an investment in our class a common stock is not an investment in any of our funds, and the assets and revenues of our funds are not directly available to us.
our class a common stock is only securities of kkr & co. inc., the holding company of the kkr business. while our historical consolidated financial statements include financial information, including assets and revenues, of certain funds on a consolidated basis, and our future financial statements will continue to consolidate certain of these funds, such assets and revenues are available to the fund and not to us except to a limited extent through management fees, carried interest or other incentive income, distributions and other proceeds arising from agreements with funds, as discussed in more detail in this report.
79
our class a common stock price may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale or for exchange, and issued or issuable pursuant to our equity incentive plans or as consideration in acquisitions.
the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of class a common stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. as of february 12, 2019, we have 533,486,948 shares of class a common stock outstanding, which amount excludes shares beneficially owned by kkr holdings in the form of kkr group partnership units discussed below and shares available for future issuance under our equity incentive plan or our new equity incentive plan.
as of february 12, 2019, kkr holdings owns 299,081,239 kkr group partnership units that may be exchanged, on a quarterly basis, for our shares of class a common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of the exchange or the perception that an exchange may occur of a large number of kkr group partnership units for shares of our class a common stock. these exchanges, or the possibility that these exchanges may occur, also might make it more difficult for holders of our class a common stock to sell shares of our class a common stock in the future at a time and at a price that they deem appropriate.
in addition, we will continue to issue additional shares of class a common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans, and such issuances may increase in the future as equity awards granted by kkr holdings decrease. see "risks related to our business-if we cannot retain and motivate our employees and other key personnel and recruit, retain and motivate new employees and other key personnel, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected." as of march 29, 2019, the effective date of our new equity incentive plan, 125,090,771 shares of class a common stock, representing 15% of the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock and kkr group partnership units (excluding kkr group partnership units held by kkr & co. inc. or its wholly-owned subsidiaries) outstanding at the close of business on december 31, 2018, will be available for issuance in respect of outstanding awards and the grant of future awards, in each case, under our new equity incentive plan. thereafter, on the first day of each fiscal year beginning in 2020, the number of shares of class a common stock available for issuance of future awards under our new equity incentive plan will be adjusted upwards to 15% of the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock and kkr group partnership units (excluding kkr group partnership units held by kkr & co. inc. or its wholly-owned subsidiaries) outstanding at the close of business on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, minus the number of shares underlying any outstanding equity awards granted under our new equity incentive plan that have not yet been delivered upon vesting. in addition, previously issued awards that were canceled or are canceled in the future, or in certain cases, withheld in respect of tax withholding obligations, are or will become available for further grant under the terms of our new equity incentive plan. see "executive compensation-kkr & co. inc. equity incentive plan." in the past, we have issued and sold kkr & co. inc. class a common stock to generate cash proceeds to pay withholding taxes, social benefit payments or similar payments payable by us in respect of awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plan or the amount of cash delivered in respect of awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plan that are settled in cash instead of class a common stock. we may issue and sell shares of our class a common stock in the future for similar purposes.
we have used and in the future may continue to use class a common stock as consideration in acquisitions and strategic investments. for example, in connection with kkr's acquisition of kfn, we issued the equivalent of approximately 104.3 million shares of our class a common stock, in connection with kkr's acquisition of avoca, we issued the equivalent of approximately 4.9 million shares of our class a common stock and in connection with kkr's initial acquisition and subsequent increase in ownership of marshall wace, we have to date issued the equivalent of approximately 17.3 million shares of our class a common stock. in addition, in connection with the marshall wace transaction or other investments or acquisitions, we may make certain future contingent payments in the form of class a common stock. if our valuations of these transactions are not accurate or if the value of these acquisitions and investments is not realized, the value of our class a common stock as well as our dividend per share of class a common stock may decline.
our issuance of preferred stock may cause the price of our class a common stock to decline, which may negatively impact our class a common stockholders.
our board of directors is authorized to issue series of shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders and, with respect to each such series, fix, without stockholder approval (except as may be required by our certificate of incorporation or any certificate of designation relating to any outstanding series of preferred stock), the designation of such series, the powers (including voting powers), preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of such series of preferred stock and the number of shares of such series. any series of preferred stock we may issue in the future will rank senior to all of our class a common
80
stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up. if we issue cumulative preferred stock in the future that has preference over our class a common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our class a common stockholders in the limited instances in which they have the right to vote, the market price of our class a common stock could decrease. similarly, the limited partnership agreements of the kkr group partnerships authorize the general partners of the kkr group partnerships to issue an unlimited number of additional securities of the kkr group partnerships with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the kkr group partnerships units, and which may be exchangeable for kkr group partnership units. for example, in march and june of 2016, kkr issued 13,800,000 series a preferred units (which have subsequently been converted to shares of series a preferred stock) and 6,200,000 series b preferred units (which have subsequently been converted to shares of series b preferred stock), respectively, and in connection with such issuances, the kkr group partnerships issued preferred units with economic terms designed to mirror kkr's respective preferred units.
our certificate of incorporation also provides us with a right to acquire all of the then outstanding shares of class a common stock under specified circumstances, which may adversely affect the price of our shares of class a common stock and the ability of holders of shares of class a common stock to participate in further growth in our stock price.
our certificate of incorporation provides that, if at any time, either (i) less than 10% of the total shares of any class our stock then outstanding (other than class b common stock, class c common stock and preferred stock) is held by persons other than the class b stockholder and its affiliates or (ii) we are subjected to registration under the provisions of the investment company act, we may exercise our right to call and purchase all of the then outstanding shares of class a common stock held by persons other than the class b stockholder or its affiliates or assign this right to the class b stockholder or any of its affiliates. as a result, a stockholder may have his or her shares of class a common stock purchased from him or her at an undesirable time or price and in a manner which adversely affects the ability of a stockholder to participate in further growth in our stock price.
risks related to our organizational structure potential conflicts of interest may arise among the class b stockholder and the holders of our class a common stock.
the class b stockholder is controlled by our senior employees. our founders, who also serve as our co-chairmen and co-chief executive officers, are the designated members of the class b stockholder and are deemed to represent a majority of the total voting power of the class b stockholder when acting together. as a result, conflicts of interest may arise among the class b stockholder and its controlling persons, on the one hand, and us and the holders of our class a common stock, on the other hand.
the class b stockholder has the ability to influence our business and affairs through its ownership of the sole share of voting stock of kkr & co. inc., the class b stockholder's general ability to appoint our board of directors, and provisions under our certificate of incorporation requiring class b stockholder approval for certain corporate actions (in addition to approval by our board of directors). see "-certain actions by our board of directors require the approval of the class b stockholder, which is controlled by our senior employees." if the holders of our class a common stock are dissatisfied with the performance of our board of directors, they have no ability to remove any of our directors, with or without cause.
further, through its ability to elect our board of directors, the class b stockholder has the ability to indirectly influence the determination of the amount and timing of the kkr group partnerships' investments and dispositions, cash expenditures, including those relating to compensation, indebtedness, issuances of additional partner interests, tax liabilities and amounts of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to holders of kkr group partnership units.
in addition, conflicts may arise relating to the selection, structuring and disposition of investments and other transactions, declaring dividends and other distributions and other matters due to the fact that our senior principals indirectly hold kkr group partnership units through kkr holdings and its subsidiaries, which are pass-through entities that are not subject to corporate income taxation.
81
certain actions by our board of directors require the approval of the class b stockholder, which is controlled by our senior employees.
although the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors is required for any action to be taken by our board of directors, certain specified actions will also require the approval of the class b stockholder, which is controlled by our senior employees. these actions consist of the following:
•   the entry into a debt financing arrangement by us in an amount in excess of 10% of our then existing long-term indebtedness (other than the entry into certain intercompany debt financing arrangements);
•   the issuance by us or our subsidiaries of any securities that would (i) represent, after such issuance, or upon conversion, exchange or exercise, as the case may be, at least 5% on a fully diluted, as converted, exchanged or exercised basis, of any class of our or their equity securities or (ii) have designations, preferences, rights, priorities or powers that are more favorable than those of the class a common stock;
•   the adoption by us of a shareholder rights plan;
•   the amendment of our certificate of incorporation, certain provisions of our bylaws relating to our board of directors and officers or the operating agreements of the kkr group partnerships;
•   the exchange or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of any kkr group partnership;
•   the merger, sale or other combination of our company or any kkr group partnership with or into any other person;
•   the transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation or grant of a security interest in all or substantially all of the assets of the kkr group partnerships;
•   the appointment or removal of our chief executive officer or a co-chief executive officer;
•   the termination of our employment of any of our officers or the officers of any of our subsidiaries or the termination of the association of a partner with any of our subsidiaries, in each case, without cause;
•   the liquidation or dissolution of us or any kkr group partnership; and
•   the withdrawal, removal or substitution of any person as the general partner of a kkr group partnership or the transfer of beneficial ownership of all or any part of a general partner interest in a kkr group partnership to any person other than a wholly-owned subsidiary.
the class b stockholder may transfer its interest in the sole share of class b common stock which could materially alter our operations.
the class b stockholder may transfer the sole outstanding share of our class b common stock held by it to a third party upon receipt of approval to do so by our board of directors and satisfaction of certain other requirements, and without the consent of the holders of our class a common stock and class c common stock. further, the members of the class b stockholder may sell or transfer all or part of their limited liability company interests in the class b stockholder at any time without kkr's approval. a new holder of our class b common stock or new controlling members of the class b stockholder may appoint directors to our board of directors who have a different philosophy and/or investment objectives from those of our current directors. a new holder of our class b common stock, new controlling members of the class b stockholder and/or the directors they appoint to our board of directors could also have a different philosophy for the management of our business, including the hiring and compensation of our investment professionals. if any of the foregoing were to occur, we could experience difficulty in forming new funds and other investment vehicles and in making new investments, and the value of our existing investments, our business, our results of operations and our financial condition could materially suffer.
we intend to pay periodic dividends to the holders of our class a common stock and preferred stock, but our ability to do so may be limited by our holding company structure and contractual restrictions.
we intend to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis. we are a holding company and have no material assets other than the kkr group partnership units that we hold through wholly-owned subsidiaries and have no independent means of generating income. accordingly, we intend to cause the kkr group partnerships to make distributions on the kkr group partnership units, including kkr group partnership units that we directly or indirectly hold, in order to provide us with sufficient amounts to fund dividends we may declare. if the kkr group partnerships make such distributions, other holders of kkr group partnership units, including kkr holdings, will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on their kkr group partnership units.
82
the declaration and payment of dividends to our class a common stockholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time. the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions by us or our subsidiaries, including restrictions contained in our debt agreements, the terms of our certificate of incorporation, and such other factors as the board of directors considers relevant including, among others: our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, including funding of investment commitments and debt service and future debt repayment obligations; general economic and business conditions; our strategic plans and prospects; our results of operations and financial condition; and our capital requirements. under section 170 of the delaware general corporation law ("dgcl"), our board of directors may only declare and pay dividends either out of our surplus (as defined in dgcl) or in case there is no such surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. however, dividends may not be declared out of net profits if our capital, computed in accordance with dgcl, shall have been diminished by depreciation in the value of our property, or by losses, or otherwise, to an amount less than the aggregate amount of the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. furthermore, by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our businesses, we risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations, new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, should the need arise.
our preferred stock ranks senior to our class a common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. unless dividends have been declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment on the preferred stock for a quarterly dividend period, during the remainder of that dividend period we may not declare or pay or set apart payment for dividends on any class of stock of kkr & co. inc. that are junior to the preferred stock, including our class a common stock, and we may not repurchase any such junior stock.
dividends on the preferred stock are discretionary and non-cumulative. holders of preferred stock will only receive dividends on their shares of preferred stock when, as and if declared by our board of directors. if dividends on a series of the preferred stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of the preferred stock, together as a class with holders of any other series of parity stock with like voting rights, will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors to our board of directors. when quarterly dividends have been declared and paid on such series of the preferred stock for four consecutive quarters following such a nonpayment event, the right of the holders of the preferred stock and such parity stock to elect these two additional directors will cease, the terms of office of these two directors will forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be reduced accordingly. additional risks related to our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock are contained in the prospectus supplement relating to the respective securities.
we will be required to pay our principals for most of the benefits relating to our use of tax attributes we receive from prior and future exchanges of our class a common stock for kkr group partnership units and related transactions.
we are required to acquire kkr group partnership units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with kkr holdings. certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the kkr group partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available. this increase in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization and therefore reduce the amount of income tax we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. this increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings, which requires us to pay to kkr holdings or to current and former principals who have exchanged kkr holdings units for shares of class a common stock as transferees of kkr group partnership units, 85% of the amount of cash tax savings, if any, in u.s. federal, state and local income tax that we realize as a result of this increase in tax basis, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings we actually realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. a termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. these payment obligations are obligations of kkr & co. inc. and certain of its intermediate holding companies and not of any kkr group partnership. while the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of our class a common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our taxable income, we expect that as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the kkr group partnerships, the payments that we may be required to make to kkr holdings or transferees of its kkr group partnership units will be substantial.
we recorded $117.9 million in our consolidated statements of financial condition as of december 31, 2018, representing the estimated aggregate future payment amount, on an undiscounted basis, under the tax receivable agreement as of such date
83
for previously exchanged kkr holdings units. see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity-other liquidity needs-contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies." as of december 31, 2018, 299.1 million kkr holdings units (the "remaining kkr holdings units") remained available for exchange into shares of our class a common stock. the present value of our aggregate cash tax savings is highly dependent on the assumed discount rate used for its calculation. assuming (i) all of the remaining kkr holdings units had been exchanged for shares of our class a common stock on december 31, 2018, (ii) all such exchanges were taxable to the exchanging unitholders, (iii) the market value of our class a common stock was $19.63 per share (which was the closing price on december 31, 2018), and (iv) our effective tax rate, for federal, state and local income tax combined, was 23.25%, we estimate that the present value of our aggregate cash tax savings over the next 15 years attributable to such hypothetical exchange of the remaining kkr holdings units would have been approximately $807 million assuming a 7% per annum discount rate and approximately $529 million assuming a 15% per annum discount rate. using the assumptions above, we estimate our payments under the tax receivable agreement to kkr holdings and current and former principals who exchange kkr holdings units in the future to be 85% of the foregoing amounts, or $686 million using a 7% discount rate and $450 million using a 15% discount rate. the estimates above also assume that we would have taxable income sufficient to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increase in tax basis and any interest imputed with respect to our payment obligations under the tax receivable agreement, and that there would be no future changes to federal, state or local income tax rates. the assumptions and estimates described above are for illustrative purposes only. these estimates are not intended to be a projection of any future financial results, and the actual increases in tax basis and any payments under the tax receivable agreement resulting from any exchanges of kkr holdings units that occur in the future are expected to vary materially from these estimates. moreover, the method for calculating the estimated aggregate future payment amount recorded in our financial statements differs in material respects from the assumptions used to calculate the present value of our aggregate cash tax savings over the next 15 years attributable to the hypothetical exchange of all remaining kkr holding units. for example, no discount rate has been applied to the estimated aggregate future payment amount for previously exchanged kkr holdings units.
we may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise. in particular, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement would be effectively accelerated in the event of an early termination of the tax receivable agreement by us or in the event of certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. in these situations, we would be required to pay an early termination payment based upon the net present value of all tax benefits that would be required to be paid by us to kkr holdings and current and former principals who have exchanged kkr holdings units. the method used to calculate the early termination payment is prescribed in the tax receivable agreement and the assumptions used for this purpose, including an applicable discount rate, which currently is libor (as defined) plus 1% (libor plus 1% was 3.50269% as of december 31, 2018), differ in material respects from the assumptions used to calculate the estimated present value of our aggregate cash tax savings for the hypothetical exchange of all remaining kkr holdings units or the estimated payment amount for previously exchanged kkr holdings units that is recorded in our financial statements. accordingly, as of december 31, 2018, the amount of early termination payment would have been significantly larger than the present value of the estimated payments under the tax receivable agreement described above. at the time of the filing of this annual report, we have no intention to exercise the early termination right.
payments under the tax receivable agreement will be based upon the tax reporting positions that we will determine. we are not aware of any issue that would cause the internal revenue service (the "irs") to challenge a tax basis increase. however, neither kkr holdings nor its transferees will reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if such tax basis increase, or the tax benefits we claim arising from such increase, is successfully challenged by the irs. as a result, in certain circumstances, payments to kkr holdings or its transferees under the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of our cash tax savings. our ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under the tax receivable agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, as discussed above, including the timing and amount of our future income.
if we were deemed to be an "investment company" subject to regulation under the investment company act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
a person will generally be deemed to be an "investment company" for purposes of the investment company act if:
•   it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; or
•   absent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of u.s. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.
84
we believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of providing investment management services and not in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. we regard ourselves as an investment management firm and do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. accordingly, we do not believe that we are an "orthodox" investment company as defined in section 3(a)(1)(a) of the investment company act and described in the first bullet point above.
with regard to the provision described in the second bullet point above, we have no material assets other than our equity interests in subsidiaries, which in turn have no material assets other than equity interests, directly or indirectly, in the kkr group partnerships. through these interests, we indirectly are the sole general partners of the kkr group partnerships and indirectly are vested with all management and control over the kkr group partnerships. we do not believe our equity interests in our subsidiaries are investment securities, and we believe that the capital interests of the general partners of our funds in their respective funds are neither securities nor investment securities. accordingly, based on our determination, less than 40% of the partnership's total assets (exclusive of u.s. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis are comprised of assets that could be considered investment securities. however, our subsidiaries have a significant number of investment securities, and we expect to make investments in other investment securities from time to time. we monitor these holdings regularly to confirm our continued compliance with the 40% test described in the second bullet point above. the need to comply with this 40% test may cause us to restrict our business and subsidiaries with respect to the assets in which we can invest and/or the types of securities we may issue, sell investment securities, including on unfavorable terms, acquire assets or businesses that could change the nature of our business or potentially take other actions that may be viewed as adverse by the holders of our class a common stock, in order to ensure conformity with exceptions provided by, and rules and regulations promulgated under, the investment company act.
the investment company act and the rules and regulations thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operation of investment companies. among other things, the investment company act and the rules and regulations thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, generally prohibit the issuance of options and impose certain governance requirements. we intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act. if anything were to happen which would cause us to be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act, requirements imposed by the investment company act, including limitations on our capital structure, ability to transact business with affiliates and ability to compensate key employees, would make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and arrangements between and among us, including the kkr group partnerships, and kkr holdings, and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we may be required to limit the amount of investments that we make as a principal, potentially divest of our investments or otherwise conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the registration and other requirements of the investment company act.
with respect to our subsidiary kfn, we believe it is not and does not propose to be primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, and we do not believe that kfn has held itself out as such. kfn conducts its operations primarily through its majority-owned subsidiaries, each of which is either outside of the definition of an investment company as defined in the investment company act or excepted from such definition under the investment company act. kfn monitors its holdings regularly to confirm its continued compliance with the 40% test described in the second bullet point above, and restricts its subsidiaries with respect to the assets in which each of them can invest and/or the types of securities each of them may issue in order to ensure conformity with exceptions provided by, and rules and regulations promulgated under, the investment company act. if the sec were to disagree with kfn's treatment of one or more of its subsidiaries as being excepted from the investment company act, with its determination that one or more of its other holdings are not investment securities for purposes of the 40% test, or with its determinations as to the nature of its business or the manner in which it holds itself out, kfn and/or one or more of its subsidiaries could be required either (i) to change substantially the manner in which it conducts its operations to avoid being subject to the investment company act or (ii) to register as an investment company. either of these would likely have a material adverse effect on kfn, its ability to service its indebtedness and to make distributions on its shares, and on the market price of its securities, and could thereby materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
on august 31, 2011 the sec published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding rule 3a-7 under the investment company act and a concept release seeking information on section 3(c)(5)(c) of the investment company act, two provisions with which kkr's subsidiaries, including kfn, must comply under the 40% test described above. among the issues for which the sec has requested comment is whether rule 3a-7 should be modified so that parent companies of subsidiaries that rely on rule 3a-7 should treat their interests in such subsidiaries as investment securities for purposes of the 40% test. the sec is also seeking information about the nature of entities that invest in mortgages and mortgage-related pools and how the sec staff's interpretive positions in connection with section 3(c)(5)(c) affect these entities. although no further action has been taken by the sec, any guidance or action from the sec or its staff, including changes that the sec may ultimately propose and
85
adopt to the way rule 3a-7 applies to entities or new or modified interpretive positions related to section 3(c)(5)(c), could further inhibit kkr's ability, or the ability of any of its subsidiaries, including kfn, to pursue its current or future operating strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we may from time to time undertake internal reorganizations that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.
on july 1, 2018, we converted from a delaware limited partnership to a delaware corporation. from time to time, we may undertake other internal reorganizations in an effort to simplify our organizational structure, streamline our operations or for other operational reasons. such internal reorganization may involve, among other things, the combination or dissolution of certain of our existing subsidiaries and the creation of new subsidiaries. these transactions could be disruptive to our business, result in significant expense, require regulatory approvals, and fail to result in the intended or expected benefits, any of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
other anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could delay or prevent a change in control.
in addition to the provisions described elsewhere relating to the class b stockholder's control, other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by, for example:
•   permitting our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;
•   requiring advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations if they are ever permitted by applicable law; and
•   placing limitations on convening stockholder meetings.
these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control.

item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of kkr & co. inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. the historical consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of kkr. in addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" and "risk factors." actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
overview of business for a discussion about our business lines, our reportable segment, and our firm, see item 1. "business."
business environment economic and market conditions economic conditions. as a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions globally. global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably, our ability to raise capital from investors, and our ability to make new investments. financial and economic conditions in the united states, european union, japan, china, and other major economies are significant contributors to the global economy.
as of december 31, 2018, key economic indicators of u.s. economic growth, including gdp growth, unemployment and inflation, remained at healthy levels despite the volatility of the u.s. stock market at the end of 2018. however, economic projections presented at a meeting of the federal open market committee in december 2018 signaled an expected slow-down in u.s. gdp growth in 2019 compared to 2018. the u.s. federal reserve suspended its plans to continue raising its benchmark interest rate and held the rate steady in january 2019, after four rate increases in 2018. in the united states, real gdp growth is estimated to be 2.9% for the full year ended december 31, 2018, compared to 2.2% in the prior year; the u.s. unemployment rate was 3.9% as of december 31, 2018, down from 4.1% as of december 31, 2017; u.s. core consumer price index was 2.2% on a year-over-year basis as of december 31, 2018, up from 1.8% on a year-over-year basis as of december 31, 2017; and the effective federal funds rate set by the u.s. federal reserve was 2.4% as of december 31, 2018, up from 1.3% as of december 31, 2017.
as of december 31, 2018, the european union showed signs of slow-down in economic growth, with concerns of a potential recession in italy and rising uncertainty over the terms of britain's exit from the european union. the european central bank decided to end its quantitative easing program at the end of december 2018, which added to the concern about the slowing economic growth in the region. in the euro area, real gdp growth is estimated to be 1.9% for the year ended december 31, 2018 down from 2.4% in the prior year; the euro area unemployment rate was 7.9% as of december 31, 2018, down from 8.6% as of december 31, 2017; euro area core inflation was 1.0% on a year-over-year basis as of december 31, 2018, up from 0.9% as of december 31, 2017; and the short-term benchmark interest rate set by the european central bank was 0.0% as of december 31, 2018, unchanged from december 31, 2017.
as of december 31, 2018, the bank of japan maintained its accommodative monetary policy and projected a continued "expanding trend" for the economy through 2020. chinese economic growth slowed during the fourth quarter of 2018 amid china's ongoing trade conflicts with the united states. in japan, the short-term benchmark interest rate set by the bank of japan was -0.1% as of december 31, 2018, unchanged from december 31, 2017; and in china, reported real gdp is estimated to be 6.6% in the year ended december 31, 2018, below the 6.8% reported for the year ended december 31, 2017.
these and other key issues could have repercussions across regional and global financial markets, which could adversely affect the valuations of our investments. other key issues include (i) political uncertainty caused by, among other things, populist political parties and economic nationalist sentiments, (ii) regulatory changes regarding, for example, taxation, international trade, cross-border investments, immigration, and austerity programs, (iii) increased volatility in stock markets, (iv) the u.s. federal reserve potentially raising its benchmark interest rates again and (v) technological advancements and innovations that may disrupt marketplaces and businesses. for a further discussion of how market conditions may affect our businesses, see "risk factors-risks related to our business-difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing
93
the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition."
equity and credit markets. global equity and credit markets have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in general, a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns, which also impacts our ability to generate incentive fees and carried interest. periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns. low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may negatively impact expected returns on all types of investments. higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies have caused, and may further cause, the default risk of these countries to increase, and this could impact the operations or value of our investments that operate in these regions. areas such as japan, which have ongoing central bank quantitative easing campaigns and comparatively low interest rates relative to the united states, could potentially experience further currency volatility and weakness relative to the u.s. dollar.
many of our investments are in equities, so a change in global equity prices or in market volatility directly impacts the value of our investments and our profitability as well as our ability to realize investment gains and the receptiveness of fund investors to our investment products. for the year ended december 31, 2018, global equity markets were negative, with the s&p 500 index down 4.4% and the msci world index down 8.2% on a total return basis including dividends. equity market volatility as evidenced by the chicago board options exchange market volatility index (the "vix"), a measure of volatility, ended at 25.4 as of december 31, 2018, increasing from 11.0 as of december 31, 2017. however, since december 31, 2018, the u.s. equity market has experienced a significant rebound, coinciding with a decrease in volatility. for a discussion of our valuation methods, see "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage-our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition" and "-critical accounting policies-fair value measurements-level iii valuation methodologies."
many of our investments are also in non-investment grade credit instruments, and our funds and our portfolio companies also rely on credit financing and the ability to refinance existing debt. consequently, any decrease in the value of credit instruments that we have invested in or any increase in the cost of credit financing reduces our returns and decreases our net income. in particular due in part to holdings of credit instruments such as clos on our balance sheet, the performance of the credit markets has had an amplified impact on our financial results, as we directly bear the full extent of losses from credit instruments on our balance sheet. credit markets can also impact valuations because a discounted cash flow analysis is generally used as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. in addition, with respect to our credit instruments, tightening credit spreads are generally expected to lead to an increase, and widening credit spreads are generally expected to lead to a decrease, in the value of these credit investments, if not offset by hedging or other factors. in addition, the significant widening of credit spreads is also typically expected to negatively impact equity markets, which in turn would negatively impact our portfolio and us as noted above. during the year ended december 31, 2018, u.s. investment grade corporate bond spreads (bofa merrill lynch us corporate index) widened by 60 basis points and u.s. high-yield corporate bond spreads (bofaml hy master ii index) widened by 170 basis points. the non-investment grade credit indices were mixed during the year ended december 31, 2018, with the s&p/lsta leveraged loan index up 0.4% and the bofaml hy master ii index down 2.3%. during the year ended december 31, 2018, 10-year government bond yields rose 28 basis points in the united states, rose 9 basis points in the united kingdom, fell 19 basis points in germany, fell 58 basis points in china, and fell 5 basis points in japan. for a further discussion of how market conditions may affect our businesses, see "risk factors-risks related to our business-difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition" and "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage-our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition."
for further discussion of the impact of global credit markets on our financial condition and results of operations, see "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage-changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our investment funds, their portfolio companies and strategies pursued with our balance sheet assets to obtain attractive financing for their investments or to refinance existing debt and may increase the cost of such financing or refinancing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income," "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage-our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income
94
we realize and our results of operations and financial condition" and "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage-our funds and our firm through our balance sheet may make a limited number of investments, or investments that are concentrated in certain issuers, geographic regions or asset types, which could negatively affect our performance or the performance of our funds to the extent those concentrated assets perform poorly." for a further discussion of our valuation methods, see "-critical accounting policies-fair value measurements-level iii valuation methodologies."
foreign exchange rates. foreign exchange rates have a substantial impact on the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. currency volatility can also affect our businesses and investments that deal in cross-border trade. the appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar is expected to contribute to a decrease or increase, respectively, in the u.s. dollar value of our non-u.s. investments to the extent unhedged. in addition, an appreciating u.s. dollar would be expected to make the exports of u.s. based companies less competitive, which may lead to a decline in their export revenues, if any, while a depreciating u.s. dollar would be expected to have the opposite effect. moreover, when selecting investments for our investment funds that are denominated in u.s. dollars, an appreciating u.s. dollar may create opportunities to invest at more attractive u.s. dollar prices in certain countries outside of the united states, while a depreciating u.s. dollar would be expected to have the opposite effect. for our investments denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, the depreciation in such currencies will generally contribute to the decrease in the valuation of such investments, to the extent unhedged, and adversely affect the u.s. dollar equivalent revenues of portfolio companies with substantial revenues denominated in such currencies, while the appreciation in such currencies would be expected to have the opposite effect. for the year ended december 31, 2018, the euro fell 4.5%, the british pound fell 5.6%, the japanese yen rose 2.7%, and the chinese renminbi fell 5.4%, respectively, relative to the u.s. dollar. for additional information regarding our foreign exchange rate risk, see "-quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk-exchange rate risk."
commodity markets. our private markets portfolio contains energy real asset investments, and certain of our other private markets and public markets strategies and products, including private equity, direct lending, special situations and clos, also have meaningful investments in the energy sector. the value of these investments is heavily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the long-term price of wti crude oil decreased approximately 6%, while the long-term price of natural gas decreased approximately 8%. the long-term price of wti crude oil decreased from approximately $53 per barrel to $50 per barrel, and the long-term price of natural gas decreased from approximately $2.82 per mcf to $2.60 per mcf as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2018, respectively. when commodity prices decline or if a decline is not offset by other factors, we would expect the value of our energy real asset investments to be adversely impacted, to the extent unhedged. in addition, because we hold certain energy assets, which had a fair value of $0.7 billion as of december 31, 2018 on our balance sheet, these price movements would have an amplified impact on our financial results, to the extent unhedged, as we would directly bear the full extent of such gains or losses. for additional information regarding our energy real assets, see "-critical accounting policies-fair value measurements-level iii valuation methodologies-real asset investments" and "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage-our funds and our firm through our balance sheet may make a limited number of investments, or investments that are concentrated in certain issuers, geographic regions or asset types, which could negatively affect our performance or the performance of our funds to the extent those concentrated assets perform poorly."
business conditions our segment revenues consist of fees, performance income and investment income. our ability to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors, our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet and our ability to realize investments at a profit.
our ability to attract new capital and investors. our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation or income. since 2010, we have expanded into strategies such as energy, infrastructure, real estate, growth equity, core, credit and, through hedge fund partnerships, hedge funds. in several of these strategies, our first time funds have begun raising successor funds, and we expect the cost of raising such successor funds to be lower. we have also reached out to new fund investors, including retail and high net worth investors. however, fundraising continues to be competitive. while our americas fund xii, asian fund iii and our real estate partners americas ii fund exceeded the size of their respective predecessor funds, there is no assurance that fundraises for our other flagship private equity funds or for our newer strategies and their successor funds will experience similar success. if we are unable to successfully raise comparably sized or larger funds, our aum, fpaum, and associated fees attributable to new capital raised in future periods may be lower than in prior years. new capital organically raised in aum for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $34.0 billion, $38.7 billion and $28.8 billion, respectively. see "risk factors-risks related to our business-our inability to raise additional or successor funds (or raise successor funds of a comparable size as our predecessor funds) could have a material adverse impact on our business."
95
our ability to successfully deploy capital. our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital available to us and participate in capital markets transactions. greater competition, high valuations, increased overall cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. additionally, because we seek to make investments that have an ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we may experience periods of reduced investment activity. we have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. reduced levels of transaction activity also tends to result in reduced potential future investment gains, lower transaction fees and lower fees for our capital markets business line, which may earn fees in the syndication of equity or debt. capital invested for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $20.2 billion, $18.4 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively, and syndicated capital for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $6.3 billion, $4.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
our ability to realize investments. challenging market and economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to exit and realize value from our investments and result in lower-than-expected returns. although the equity markets are not the only means by which we exit investments, the strength and liquidity of the u.s. and relevant global equity markets generally, and the initial public offering market specifically, affect the valuation of, and our ability to successfully exit, our equity positions in our private equity portfolio companies in a timely manner. we may also realize investments through strategic sales. when financing is not available or becomes too costly, it may be more difficult to find a buyer that can successfully raise sufficient capital to purchase our investments. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, through exit activity in our investments, we realized investment income of $651.8 million, $479.7 million, and $694.4 million, respectively, and carried interest of $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively in each case on a segment basis.
basis of accounting we consolidate the financial results of the kkr group partnerships and their consolidated entities, which include the accounts of our investment management and capital markets companies, the general partners of unconsolidated funds and vehicles, general partners of certain funds that are consolidated and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities including certain clos and cmbs. we refer to clos and cmbs as collateralized financing entities ("cfes").
when an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income, cash flows and other amounts, on a gross basis. while the consolidation of a consolidated fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to kkr or kkr's stockholders' capital that kkr reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under gaap. this is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. the single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations.
for a further discussion of our consolidation policies, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies."
key financial measures under gaap revenues fees and other fees and other consist primarily of (i) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, clos, other vehicles, and separately managed accounts; (ii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities; (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies; (iv) expense reimbursements from certain investment funds and portfolio companies; (v) revenue earned by oil and gas-producing entities that are consolidated; and (vi) consulting fees earned by consolidated entities that employ non-employee operating consultants. these fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. these termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.
96
capital allocation-based income capital allocation-based income is earned from those arrangements whereby kkr serves as general partner and includes income from kkr's capital interest as well as "carried interest" which entitles kkr to a disproportionate allocation of investment income from investment funds' limited partners.

expenses compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries, bonuses, and benefits, as well as equity-based compensation consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equity-based awards, carry pool allocations, and other performance-based income compensation. the amounts allocated to the carry pool and other performance-based income compensation are accounted for as compensatory profit-sharing arrangements and recorded as compensation and benefits expenses.
all employees and employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by kkr or its consolidated entities, and is accounted for as compensation and benefits expense. these employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, overall profitability, and other matters. while cash bonuses paid to most employees are borne by kkr and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense, in the past cash bonuses that are paid to certain employees have been borne by kkr holdings. these bonuses have historically been funded with distributions that kkr holdings receives on kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of kkr holdings. because employees are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested, any amounts allocated to employees in excess of an employee's vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense. these compensation charges are currently recorded based on the amount of cash expected to be paid by kkr holdings. because kkr makes only fixed quarterly dividends, the distributions made on kkr group partnership units underlying any unvested kkr holdings units are generally insufficient to fund annual cash bonus compensation to the same extent as in periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2015. in addition, substantially all remaining units in kkr holdings have been allocated and, while subject to a 5 year vesting period, will become fully vested by 2021, thus decreasing the amount of distributions received by kkr holdings that are available for annual cash bonus compensation. we, therefore, expect to pay all or substantially all of the cash bonus payments from kkr's cash from operations and the carry pool; although, from time to time, kkr holdings may contribute to the cash bonus payments in the future. for the year ending december 31, 2018, no cash bonuses were contributed by kkr holdings and all amounts paid were funded from other sources, including cash from our operations and the carry pool. see "risks related to our business-if we cannot retain and motivate our principals and other key personnel and recruit, retain and motivate new principals and other key personnel, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected" regarding the adequacy of such distributions to fund future discretionary cash bonuses.
kkr uses several methods, which are designed to yield comparable results, to allocate carried interest and other performance income compensation. with respect to kkr's investment funds that provide for carried interest without a preferred return, kkr allocates 40% of the carried interest received from such funds to its carry pool for employees and non-employee operating consultants. beginning with the quarter ended september 30, 2016, for investment funds that provide for carried interest with a preferred return and have accrued carried interest as of june 30, 2016, kkr also includes 40% of the management fees that would have been subject to a management fee refund as performance income compensation. because of the different ways management fees are refunded in preferred return and non-preferred return funds that provide for carried interest, this calculation of 40% of the portion of the management fees subject to refund for funds that have a preferred return is designed to allocate to compensation an amount comparable to the amount that would have been allocated to the carry pool had the fund not had a preferred return. beginning with the quarter ended september 30, 2017, for then-current and future carry generating funds with a preferred return and no or minimal accrued carried interest as of june 30, 2017, kkr allocates 43% of the carried interest to the carry pool instead of 40% of carried interest. for impacted funds, the incremental 3% replaces the allocation of management fee refunds that would have been calculated for those funds and is designed, based on a historical financial analysis of certain investment funds, to allocate an amount for preferred return funds that is comparable to the management fee refunds that would have been allocated as performance income compensation for those funds. the percentage of carried interest, management fee refunds, and incentive fees allocable to the carry pool or as performance income compensation is subject to change from time to time. for a discussion of how management fees are refunded for preferred

return funds and non-preferred funds see "-fair value measurements-recognition of carried interest in the statement of operations."
general, administrative and other general, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges, expenses (including impairment charges) incurred by oil and gas-producing entities that are consolidated, costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions ("broken-deal expenses"), and other general operating expenses. a portion of these general administrative and other expenses, in particular broken-deal expenses, are borne by fund investors.
investment income (loss)
net gains (losses) from investment activities net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities as well as income earned from certain equity method investments. fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. the fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. for a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see "-critical accounting policies-fair value measurements."
dividend income dividend income consists primarily of distributions that we and our consolidated investment funds receive from portfolio companies in which they invest. dividend income is recognized primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of cash generated from operations from portfolio investments, and (iii) other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio investments.
interest income interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our credit instruments in which we and our consolidated funds and other entities invest as well as interest on our cash balances and other investments.
interest expense interest expense is incurred from debt issued by kkr, including debt issued by kfn, credit facilities entered into by kkr, debt securities issued by consolidated cfes, and financing arrangements at our consolidated funds entered into primarily with the objective of managing cash flow. kfn's debt obligations are non-recourse to kkr beyond the assets of kfn. debt securities issued by consolidated cfes are supported solely by the investments held at the cfe and are not collateralized by assets of any other kkr entity. our obligations under financing arrangements at our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro rata equity interest in such funds. however, in some circumstances, we may provide limited guarantees of the obligations of our general partners in an amount equal to its pro rata equity interest in such funds. our management companies bear no obligations with respect to financing arrangements at our consolidated funds. we also may provide other kinds of guarantees. see "-liquidity."

income taxes on july 1, 2018, we converted from a delaware limited partnership to a delaware corporation. prior to the conversion, kkr's investment income and carried interest generally were not subject to u.s. corporate income taxes. subsequent to the conversion, all income earned by kkr is subject to u.s. corporate income taxes, resulting in an overall higher income tax expense (or benefit) in periods subsequent to the conversion.
kkr & co. inc. is a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes and thus is subject to u.s. federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level on kkr's share of net taxable income. in addition, the kkr group partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the united states as partnerships for u.s. federal income tax purposes and as corporate entities in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions. these entities, in some cases, are subject to u.s. state or local income taxes or non-u.s. income taxes.
as a result of the conversion, kkr recognized a partial step-up in the tax basis of certain assets that will be recovered as those assets are sold or the basis is amortized. on the date of the conversion, we recorded an estimated net tax benefit and estimated net deferred tax asset of $257.1 million relating to this partial step-up in tax basis.  the actual amount of the partial step-up in tax basis when it is finally determined is expected to differ, possibly materially, from the current estimate, which in turn is expected to cause our income tax provision and effective tax rate under gaap to differ, possibly to a material extent, from the current estimate. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 11 "income taxes."
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available.
for a further discussion of our income tax policies, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 11 "income taxes."
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents the ownership interests that certain third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership interests in our kkr group partnerships that are held by kkr holdings. the allocable share of income and expense attributable to these interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in our kkr group partnerships held by kkr holdings, we expect a portion of net income (loss) will continue to be attributed to noncontrolling interests in our business.
for a further discussion of our noncontrolling interests policies, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies."

key segment and other operating and performance measures the key performance measures that follow are used by management in making operational and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the overall performance of kkr's businesses. kkr's segment reporting is presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between kkr & co. inc. and kkr holdings l.p. and as such represents the business in total. in addition, kkr's segment reporting is presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the investment funds and cfes that kkr manages as well as other consolidated entities that are not subsidiaries of kkr & co. inc.
we disclose certain financial measures in this report that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with gaap. we believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis to our gaap results is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of kkr's businesses. these financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for similar financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap, if available. we caution readers that these non-gaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers, and as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, where applicable, are included within item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 14 "segment reporting" and under "-segment balance sheet."
adjusted shares adjusted shares are used as a measure of the total common equity ownership of kkr that is held by kkr & co. inc. (including equity awards issued under the amended and restated kkr & co. inc. 2010 equity incentive plan (the "equity incentive plan"), but excluding preferred stock), kkr holdings and other holders of securities exchangeable into class a common stock of kkr & co. inc. and represent the fully diluted share count of class a common stock using the if-converted method. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides an indication of the total common equity ownership of kkr as if all outstanding kkr holdings units, equity awards issued under the equity incentive plan and other exchangeable securities had been exchanged for class a common stock of kkr & co. inc. the 6.75% series a preferred stock ("series a preferred stock") and 6.50% series b preferred stock ("series b preferred stock") are not exchangeable for class a common stock of kkr & co. inc.
adjusted shares eligible for distribution adjusted shares eligible for distribution represents the portion of total adjusted shares that are eligible to receive a dividend. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the calculation of amounts available for distribution as dividends on a per share basis. weighted average adjusted shares eligible for distribution is used in the calculation of after-tax distributable earnings per share.
after-tax distributable earnings after-tax distributable earnings is a performance measure of kkr's earnings on a segment basis excluding mark-to-market gains (losses). starting with the second quarter of 2018, it is defined as the amount of net realized earnings of kkr for a given reporting period, after deducting equity-based compensation. kkr revised the definition of after-tax distributable earnings starting in the second quarter of 2018, because it reflects how the chief operating decision makers allocate resources and assess performance of kkr's business. kkr believes that after-tax distributable earnings is useful to stockholders as it aligns kkr's net realization performance with the manner in which kkr receives its revenues and determines the compensation of its employees. after-tax distributable earnings does not represent and is not used to calculate actual dividends under kkr's dividend policy. historically, equity-based compensation expense relating to the equity incentive plan was not reflected in our calculation of after-tax distributable earnings. under kkr's segment presentation, equity-based compensation expense is included in after-tax distributable earnings as a component of compensation expense in order to reflect the dilutive nature of these non-cash equity-based awards. for comparability, after-tax distributable earnings for the comparable prior periods have been calculated using this definition.
assets under management ("aum")
assets under management represent the assets managed or advised by kkr from which kkr is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest (either currently or upon deployment of capital), general partner capital, and assets managed or advised by strategic bdc partnership and hedge fund managers in which kkr holds a minority ownership interest. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital raising activities of kkr and its hedge fund managers and the overall activity in their investment funds and other managed capital. kkr calculates the amount of aum as
100
of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of kkr's investment funds; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which kkr is currently not earning management fees or carried interest; (iii) the fair value of investments in kkr's co-investment vehicles; (iv) the par value of outstanding clos (excluding clos wholly-owned by kkr); (v) kkr's pro rata portion of the aum of hedge fund managers in which kkr holds a minority ownership interest; (vi) all aum of the strategic bdc partnership with fs investments; and (vii) the fair value of other assets managed by kkr. the pro rata portion of the aum of hedge fund managers is calculated based on kkr's percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity's respective aum. kkr's definition of aum is not based on any definition of aum that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions.
book value book value is a measure of the net assets of kkr's reportable segment and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of kkr's investments and other assets, including carried interest. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the assets and liabilities of kkr excluding the assets and liabilities that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders and to the holders of the series a and series b preferred stock. as of september 30, 2018 and following the conversion, kkr's segment balance sheet reflects kkr's tax assets and liabilities as prepared under gaap.
capital invested capital invested is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) kkr's investment funds, (ii) kkr's principal activities business line as a co-investment, if any, alongside kkr's investment funds, and (iii) kkr's principal activities business line in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by kkr's capital markets business line, if any. capital invested is used as a measure of investment activity at kkr during a given period. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across kkr's business lines. capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements like credit facilities, as applicable. capital invested excludes (i) investments in certain leveraged credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by kkr's principal activities business line that is not a co-investment alongside kkr's investment funds, and (iii) capital invested by kkr's principal activities business line that is not invested in connection with a syndication transaction by kkr's capital markets business line. capital syndicated by kkr's capital markets business line to third parties other than kkr's investment funds or principal activities business line is not included in capital invested.  see also "-syndicated capital."
fee paying aum ("fpaum")
fee paying aum ("fpaum") represents only the aum from which kkr receives management fees. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which kkr earns management fees. fpaum is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate kkr's and its hedge fund and bdc partnership management fees and differs from aum in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which kkr does not receive a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which it receives only carried interest or is otherwise not currently receiving a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.
fee related earnings ("fre")
fee related earnings is a supplemental measure of earnings of kkr on a segment basis before performance income and investment income. kkr believes this measure may be useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of kkr's fee generating management companies and capital markets businesses. starting with the second quarter of 2018, fee related earnings is calculated as kkr's total fees and other, net, multiplied by kkr's segment operating margin. for purposes of the fee related earnings calculation, segment operating margin is calculated as segment operating earnings, before equity-based compensation, divided by total segment revenues. historically, fee related earnings was calculated as operating earnings of kkr on a segment basis before performance income, related performance income compensation and investment income. kkr revised the definition of fee related earnings starting in the second quarter of 2018 to provide supplemental information about fees generated from kkr's management companies and capital markets business because kkr believes it provides increased transparency on kkr's underlying financial results to the stockholders. fee related earnings for the comparable prior periods have been calculated using this definition.
101
income taxes paid income taxes paid represents the estimated total tax impact on kkr's distributable earnings before taxes. this amount is the implied amount of income taxes that would be paid assuming that all pre-tax distributable earnings were allocated to kkr & co. inc., which would occur following an exchange of all kkr holdings units for class a common stock of kkr & co. inc.
outstanding adjusted shares outstanding adjusted shares represents the portion of total adjusted shares that would receive assets of kkr if it were to be liquidated as of a particular date. outstanding adjusted shares is used to calculate book value per outstanding adjusted share, which we believe is useful to stockholders as it provides a measure of net assets of kkr's reportable segment on a per share basis.
segment operating earnings segment operating earnings represents segment earnings before interest expense, preferred dividends, income attributable to noncontrolling interests and income taxes paid. we believe segment operating earnings is useful to stockholders as it provides a supplemental measure of our operating performance without taking into account items that we do not believe relate directly to operations.
syndicated capital syndicated capital is the aggregate amount of capital in transactions originated by kkr and its investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which has been distributed to third parties, generally in exchange for a fee. it does not include (i) capital invested in such transactions by kkr investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which is instead reported in capital invested, (ii) debt capital that is arranged as part of the acquisition financing of transactions originated by kkr investment funds, and (iii) debt capital that is either underwritten or arranged on a best efforts basis. syndicated capital is used as a measure of investment activity for kkr during a given period, and we believe that this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into levels of syndication activity in kkr's capital markets business line and across kkr's investment platform.
uncalled commitments uncalled commitments are used as a measure of unfunded capital commitments that kkr's investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to kkr's investment funds to make future investments. uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements.

prior to january 1, 2018, to the extent an investment fund was not consolidated, kkr accounted for carried interest within fees and other separately from its general partner capital interest, which was included in net gains (losses) from investment activities in the consolidated statements of operations. effective january 1, 2018, the carried interest component of the general partner interest and the capital interest kkr holds in its investment funds as the general partner are accounted for as a single unit of account and reported in capital allocation-based income within revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. this change in accounting principle has been applied on a full retrospective basis. see note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
total fees and other for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in transaction fees, management fees and expense reimbursements, and a decrease in fee credits. fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds are eliminated upon consolidation under gaap. transaction and monitoring fees earned that generate these fee credits are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from kkr portfolio companies which are not consolidated. accordingly, certain transaction and monitoring fees are reflected in revenues without a corresponding fee credit. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in oil and gas revenue.
for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected our transaction fees and monitoring fees during the period, see "-segment results-segment revenues."
the increase in management fees during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior period was due primarily to management fees earned from our asian fund iii and global infrastructure investors iii fund which entered their investment periods in the second quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2018, respectively. this increase was partially offset by a reduction in management fees from (i) our bdc platform as a result of the fs investments transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2018, as is further explained in the next paragraph, (ii) prisma capital partners lp ("prisma") as a result of the transaction to combine pacific alternative asset management company, llc ("paamco") and prisma to create paamco prisma (the "paamco prisma transaction") that closed in the second quarter of 2017, as is further explained in the next paragraph, (iii) lower management fees calculated based on lower levels of invested capital as a result of realizations primarily in our european fund iii, 2006 fund and asian fund and (iv) lower management fees paid by our asian fund ii when it entered its post-investment period in the second quarter of 2017, in which it pays fees at a lower rate than during the investment period and based on capital invested at the time rather than total committed capital.

kkr reports its investment in fs/kkr advisor and paamco prisma using the equity method of accounting, and as such, kkr reflects its allocation of the net income of these entities as investment income.  accordingly, the management fees of the bdcs and prisma that had been reported in management fee revenues prior to the closing of the transactions described above are now reflected on a net basis as part of our allocation of the net income of these entities in 2018 resulting in a decrease in our reported gross management fees when compared to the prior period.
the decrease in carried interest and general partner capital interest during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior period was due primarily to a lower level of net appreciation in the value of our private equity investment portfolio as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017.
compensation and benefits expenses the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in compensation resulting from a lower level of net carried interest in our investment funds as compared to the prior period. partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in other compensation due to a higher level of fees during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 as well as higher equity-based compensation charges resulting from an increase in the weighted average number of unvested shares outstanding.
general, administrative and other expenses the increase for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to (i) an increase in professional fees and travel expenses incurred, the most significant of which were professional fees incurred in connection with the conversion, (ii) an increase in expenses reimbursable by investment funds, (iii) a higher level of expenses that are creditable to our investment funds, which includes broken-deal expenses and (vi) a higher level of financing costs incurred related to debt at new consolidated clos as compared to the prior period. these increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization of our consolidated oil and gas-producing entities compared to the prior period primarily caused by lower production and the sale of an oil and gas producing entity during the second quarter of 2018 and (ii) expenses of prisma that had been reported on a gross basis prior to the closing of the paamco prisma transaction on june 1, 2017 and that are now reflected as part of our allocation of the net income of paamco prisma after june 1, 2017, resulting in a decrease in our reported general, administrative and other expenses as compared to the prior period.

net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2018
the net gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 were comprised of net realized gains of $534.7 million and net unrealized gains of $720.2 million.
realized gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2018, realized gains related primarily to (i) the sale of assets in our consolidated special situations funds, (ii) the fs investments transaction, (iii) the sale of our equity interest in nephila, (iv) the sale of real estate investments held through certain consolidated entities, and (v) the partial sale of our investment in first data corporation (nyse: fdc) in the third quarter of 2018 which is held in part as a direct co-investment by kkr.
realized losses from investment activities partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses primarily relating (i) the write-off of trinity holdings llc (energy sector) and certain clos during the year ended december 31, 2018 and (ii) the partial write-off of our investment in preferred proppants, llc (manufacturing sector) which is held directly by kkr and in our consolidated special situations funds.
unrealized gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2018, unrealized gains were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market gains in portfolio companies in our core investment strategy, the most significant of which were usi, inc. (financial services sector), petvet care centers, llc (health care sector), and heartland dental llc (health care sector), (ii) mark-to-market gains in our growth equity investments held directly by kkr and certain consolidated entities, (iii) an increase in our allocation of the net income of our hedge fund partnerships and bdc platform, (iv) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses related to the write-off of trinity holdings llc and certain clos and the partial write-off of preferred proppants, llc as described above, and (v) mark-to-market gains on investments in our energy portfolio held through certain consolidated funds.
unrealized losses from investment activities partially offsetting the unrealized gains above were unrealized losses relating to (i) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to assets sold in our consolidated special situations funds, the partial sale of first data corporation in the third quarter of 2018 which is held as a direct co-investment by kkr and the sale of real estate investments held through certain consolidated entities and (ii) mark-to-market losses on certain investments held in our consolidated special situations funds and investments held at our india debt financing company.
for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's realized investment income, see "-segment analysis." for a detailed discussion of the factors that affected our net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2017, see our discussion for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
dividend income during the year ended december 31, 2018, the most significant dividends received included $52.7 million from our consolidated energy funds, $34.7 million from our consolidated special situations funds, and $32.4 million from our consolidated real estate funds. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the most significant dividends received included$88.5 million from our consolidated special situations funds and $43.5 million from our consolidated real estate funds. significant dividends from portfolio companies or consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's dividend income, see "-segment results-segment revenues-principal activities revenues-realized investment income."
interest income the increase in interest income during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to a higher level of interest earned related to (i) the closing of seven additional consolidated clos subsequent to the year ended december 31, 2017, (ii) an increase in capital deployed in investments held by kref which is consolidated and (iii) an increase in the amount of investments held in our consolidated credit funds compared to the prior period. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest income earned as a result of the sale of kkr's beneficial

interest in four consolidated cmbs vehicles held by kref that resulted in the deconsolidation of such vehicles subsequent to december 31, 2017. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest income, see "-segment results-segment revenues-principal activities revenues-realized investment income."
interest expense the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to the impact of (i) the closing of seven additional consolidated clos subsequent to the year ended december 31, 2017, (ii) increased interest on amounts under kref's lending facilities used to finance investments in commercial loans and (iii) increased borrowings at kfn. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in (i) interest expense incurred as a result of the sale of kkr's beneficial interest in four consolidated cmbs vehicles held by kref that resulted in the deconsolidation of such vehicles subsequent to december 31, 2017 and (ii) interest expense associated with certain notes issued by consolidated clos being called for redemption subsequent to december 31, 2017. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest expense, see "-segment analysis-segment expenses-interest expense."
income (loss) before taxes the decrease in income (loss) before taxes for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 was due primarily to a lower level of carried interest and general partner capital interest, partially offset by (i) a higher level of net gains from investment activities, (ii) a higher level of fees and (iii) a lower level of compensation and benefits expense, in each case as described above.
income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2018 there was a net income tax benefit of $194.1 million which was driven primarily by tax benefits recorded on the date of the conversion. the tax benefit was partially offset by a higher level of income that is subject to corporate taxes following the conversion. prior to the conversion, kkr & co. l.p.'s investment income and carried interest generally were not subject to u.s. corporate income taxes. subsequent to the conversion, all income earned by kkr & co. inc. is subject to u.s. corporate income taxes, which we believe will result in an overall higher income tax expense (or benefit) when compared to periods prior to the conversion. our effective tax rate under gaap for the year ended december 31, 2018 was (8.6)%. as a result of the conversion kkr recognized a partial step-up in the tax basis of certain assets that will be recovered as those assets are sold or the basis is amortized. this generally results in a lower level of taxable gains upon realization of carried interest and investment income for those assets that existed on the date of the conversion. over time as these assets with higher tax basis are realized, we expect that our income tax expense and effective tax rate will increase. the pace of such increase is not currently known and is dependent on a variety of factors including the pace at which the assets with higher tax basis are realized and the mix of all assets realized in any given period. for a discussion of factors that impacted kkr's tax provision, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 11 "income taxes."
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2018 relates primarily to net income attributable to kkr holdings representing its ownership interests in the kkr group partnerships as well as third-party limited partner interests in those investment funds that we consolidate. the decrease from the prior period is due primarily to lower amounts attributed to kkr holdings in connection with a lower level of income recognized for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the prior period as well as a reduction in kkr holdings' ownership percentage in the kkr group partnerships. this decrease was partially offset by a higher level of income recorded by certain consolidated fund entities that is attributable to third party limited partners.
net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. inc.
the increase in net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. inc. for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to an overall tax benefit in the current period as compared to tax expense in the prior period as well as a higher level of net investment gains and fees, partially offset by a lower level of carried interest gains in the current period as compared to the prior period.

total fees and other for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in transaction fees, management fees, monitoring fees and expense reimbursements. these increases were partially offset by an increase in fee credits.
for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected our transaction fees and monitoring fees during the period, see "-segment results-segment revenues."
the increase in management fees during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior period was due primarily to management fees earned from our americas fund xii and asian fund iii which entered their investment periods in the first and second quarter of 2017, respectively. this increase was partially offset by a reduction in management fees from (i) prisma as a result of the paamco prisma transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2017 and (ii) lower management fees paid by our north america fund xi and asian fund ii when they entered their post-investment periods in the first and second quarter of 2017, respectively, in which they pay fees at a lower rate than during their investment periods and based on capital invested at the time rather than total committed capital.
the increase in carried interest and general partner capital interest earned during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior period was due primarily to increases in carried interest gains primarily reflecting a higher level of appreciation in the value of our private equity portfolio as compared to the prior period and to a lesser extent gains in our private credit portfolio during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
compensation and benefits expenses the increase was primarily due to (i) a higher level of carry pool allocations reflecting higher appreciation in the value of our private equity and credit portfolios, (ii) an increase in cash compensation and benefits, and (iii) an increase in equity-based compensation resulting from new equity grants of kkr holdings units during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
general, administrative and other expenses the increase was primarily due to (i) a reduction in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability during the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the acquisition of prisma from $46.6 million to zero since it was determined that it was no
109
longer probable that the sellers of prisma would be entitled to any future additional payment under the arrangement while no such reversal of expense was incurred during the current period and (ii) an increase in professional fees and other expenses incurred as compared to the prior period. these increases were partially offset by (i) a lower level of financing costs incurred relating to debt at new consolidated clos for which the fair value option has been elected, (ii) a decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization of our consolidated oil and gas-producing entities primarily caused by a lower cost basis due to previously recorded impairments, resulting in a lower unit of production depletion rate compared to the prior period, and (iii) the write-off of intangible assets during the year ended december 31, 2016 in connection with the termination of management contracts for certain credit funds that were wound down while no such charge was incurred during the current period.

net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2017
the net gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 were comprised of net realized gains of $38.3 million and net unrealized gains of $889.8 million.
realized gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2017, realized gains were comprised primarily of realized gains related to the sale of private equity investments held by kkr's balance sheet, including the final sale of our investment in us foods holding corp. (nyse: usfd), hca holdings, inc. (nyse: hca), and galenica ag (vtx: galn) and the partial sale of our investment in first data corporation.
realized losses from investment activities partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses relating to (i) alternative credit assets in our consolidated special situations funds and kfn, (ii) the sale of investments held by our consolidated clos, and (iii) the sale of our investments in fortune creek partnership (energy sector) and aurora eaglebine (energy sector) which are held in part by kkr's balance sheet in our energy portfolio.
unrealized gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2017, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market gains on alternative credit assets in our consolidated special situations funds and kfn, (ii) mark-to-market gains in certain consolidated entities, the most significant of which were unrealized gains in our growth equity investments, (iii) mark-to-market gains in our private equity portfolio held by kkr's balance sheet, the most significant of which were unrealized gains in our investment in first data corporation, (iv) mark-to-market gains in our infrastructure portfolio held by kkr's balance sheet and (v) the reversal of unrealized losses on the sale of our investment in fortune creek partnership and the restructuring of our investment in aurora eaglebine which are held by kkr's balance sheet in our energy portfolio. for the year ended december 31, 2017, unrealized gains from investment activities includes a gain of $67.2 million relating to a remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement liability which arises from changes in the associated deferred tax balances related to the 2017 tax act.

unrealized losses from investment activities partially offsetting the unrealized gains above were unrealized losses, the most significant of which were unrealized losses relating to (i) the reversal of unrealized gains on the final sale of our investments in us foods holding corp., hca holdings, inc., and galenica ag and (ii) mark-to-market losses in certain consolidated entities, the most significant of which were unrealized losses in our growth equity investments.

net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2016
the net gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 were comprised of net realized gains of $347.1 million and net unrealized losses of $136.1 million. for the year ended december 31, 2016, net realized gains were comprised primarily of the net impact of (i) realized gains on sales of private equity investments held by kkr's balance sheet, including the partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, inc. (nasdaq: wba), zimmer biomet holdings, inc. (nyse: zbh) and hca holdings, inc.; (ii) realized losses in connection with our investment in samson resources (energy sector); (iii) realized losses on assets held at consolidated clos; and (iv) realized gains on debt held at consolidated clos. for the year ended december 31, 2016, net unrealized losses were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market losses in our private equity portfolio held by kkr's balance sheet including unrealized losses in first data corporation; (ii) mark-to-market losses on assets in our consolidated special situations funds; (iii) mark-to-market losses on debt held through consolidated cmbs; and (iv) the reversal of unrealized gains on the partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, inc., zimmer biomet holdings, inc. and hca holdings, inc., as well as the reversal of unrealized gains on debt realizations at our consolidated clos. offsetting these unrealized losses were unrealized gains, the most significant of which were unrealized gains relating to (i) the reversal of unrealized losses in connection with our investment in samson resources, (ii) reversals of unrealized losses on asset realizations in our consolidated clos and (iii) mark-to-market gains on investments held through consolidated cmbs structures.
for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's realized investment income, see "-segment analysis."
dividend income during the year ended december 31, 2017, the most significant dividends received included $88.5 million from our consolidated special situations funds and $43.5 million from our consolidated real estate funds. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the most significant dividends received included $51.5 million from our consolidated special situations funds and dividends from us foods holding corp. of $23.4 million, sedgwick claims management services, inc. (financial services sector) of $12.7 million, and pra health sciences, inc. (nasdaq: prah) of $4.1 million. significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's dividend income, see "-segment results-segment revenues-principal activities revenues-realized investment income."
interest income the increase in interest income during the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to a higher level of interest earned related to (i) an increase in the amount of investments in our consolidated special situations funds and other leveraged credit funds, (ii) the impact of the consolidation of three additional clos subsequent to the year ended december 31, 2016, (iii) an increase in the amount of investments held by kref compared to the prior period and (iv) an increase in the amount of investments held at our india debt financing company. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest income at kfn primarily due to a smaller portfolio generating recurring income as well as a decrease associated with the paydown of clo 2007-01 in the second quarter of 2016. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest income, see "-segment results-segment revenues-principal activities revenues-realized investment income."
interest expense the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to the impact of (i) the consolidation of three additional clos subsequent to the year ended december 31, 2016, (ii) increased borrowings at our india debt financing company, (iii) increased cmbs issuances by kref and (iv) increased borrowings from asset backed financing vehicles managed by kkr. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with certain notes issued by consolidated clos being called for redemption during the year ended december 31, 2016, which resulted in an increased level of interest expense during 2016. specifically, as a result of a paydown made in august 2016, kkr recorded
111
increased interest expense of $59.9 million and an incremental $8.7 million of accelerated accretion of debt discounts during the year ended december 31, 2016. the paydown of clo 2007-01 during the year ended december 31, 2016 also contributed to the increased interest expense in the prior period. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest expense, see "-segment analysis-interest expense."
income (loss) before taxes the increase in income (loss) before taxes was due primarily to higher carried interest gains in our private equity portfolio and higher net gains from investment activities, partially offset by an increase in expenses, in each case as described above.
income taxes the increase in income taxes is due primarily to accounting for the impacts of the 2017 tax act which was enacted on december 22, 2017. the 2017 tax act, among other provisions, reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax act, including $97.9 million of tax expense recorded principally due to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets, are reflected in our financial results for the year ended december 31, 2017. this net write-down reduces our deferred tax assets and liabilities to a level that reflects the future tax benefit or liability that will be realized at the new u.s. federal corporate tax rate of 21%. for a discussion of factors that impacted kkr's tax provision, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 11 "income taxes."
taxes also increased as a result of a higher level of fees earned by our management companies and capital markets companies during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the prior period and to a lesser extent a higher level of carried interest gains accrued by certain general partner entities subject to corporate income tax.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2017 relates primarily to net income attributable to kkr holdings representing its ownership interests in the kkr group partnerships as well as third-party limited partner interests in those investment funds that we consolidate. the increase from the prior period is due primarily to (i) higher amounts attributed to kkr holdings in connection with higher income recognized for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the prior period, partially offset by a reduction in kkr holdings' ownership percentage in the kkr group partnerships and (ii) a higher level of income recorded by certain consolidated fund entities that is attributable to third-party limited partners.
net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. inc.
the increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to increased fee income and to a lesser extent, higher carried interest gains and higher net investment gains from investment activities in the current period as compared to the prior period.

consolidated statements of cash flows the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities which include certain consolidated investment funds and cfes notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those funds and cfes.
the assets of our consolidated funds and cfes, on a gross basis, can be substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, could have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds and cfes involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. because our consolidated funds and cfes are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations.
on january 1, 2018, kkr adopted asu no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash, which amends the guidance to add or clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. upon adoption, (i) restricted cash and cash equivalents and (ii) cash and cash equivalents held at consolidated entities were (a) included in the cash and cash-equivalents balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows and (b) disclosed in a reconciliation between the consolidated statements of financial condition and the consolidated statements of cash flows. this guidance has been applied on a full retrospective basis. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, $97.9 million and $121.0 million, respectively, of cash used by operating activities and $155.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of cash provided by investing activities were removed from net cash provided (used) by operating activities and net cash
113
provided (used) by investing activities, respectively, and included in net increase/(decrease) in cash, cash-equivalents and restricted cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

fees and other, net the increase for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in management fees and transaction fees, partially offset by a corresponding increase in fee credits.
the increase in management fees was primarily due to (i) management fees earned from our asian fund iii which entered its investment period in the second quarter of 2017 (partial year of revenue in 2017), (ii) management fees earned from our global infrastructure fund iii which entered its investment period in the second quarter of 2018 and (iii) management fees earned from our real estate partners americas ii fund which entered its investment period in the second quarter of 2017 (partial year of revenue in 2017). this net increase was partially offset by decreases due to (i) lower management fees calculated based on lower levels of invested capital as a result of realizations primarily in our european fund iii, 2006 fund and asian fund, (ii) lower management fees paid by our asian fund ii when it entered its post-investment period in the second quarter of 2017, in which it pays fees at a lower rate than during the investment period and based on capital invested at the time rather than total committed capital, and (iii) lower management fees earned from our real estate partners americas fund which entered its post-investment period in the second quarter of 2017, in which it pays fees based on capital invested rather than remaining commitments and capital invested during the investment period. for each of our asian fund ii and real estate partners americas fund, the reduction in fees in 2017 was for a partial year, whereas 2018 experienced a full year of reduced fees.
the increase in transaction fees was primarily attributable to an increase in the size of transaction fee-generating investments. during the year ended december 31, 2018, there were 41 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $7.4 million compared to 46 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $6.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2017. for the year ended december 31, 2018, approximately 59% of these transaction fees were paid by companies located in north america, 22% were paid from companies located in the asia-pacific region and 19% were paid from companies in europe. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular agreements as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and kkr's role in the transaction. additionally, transaction fees are generally not earned with respect to energy and real estate investments. the increase in fee credits is due primarily to a higher level of transaction fees and monitoring fees reimbursable to the fund investors.
117
the increase in monitoring fees was primarily attributable to an increase in recurring monitoring fees compared to the prior period, partially offset by lower termination payments. recurring monitoring fees increased $18.6 million, which was primarily the result of an increase in both the size and number of portfolio companies paying monitoring fees. for the year ended december 31, 2018, we had 71 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $1.1 million compared with 66 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $0.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. for the year ended december 31, 2018, we received termination payments of $7.5 million in connection with the ipo of brightview holdings, inc. (nyse: bv) compared to $19.6 million of termination payments received in the year ended december 31, 2017 relating to the ipo of gardner denver holdings, inc. (nyse: gdi) and national vision holdings, inc. (nasdaq: eye). these termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with the ipo and other realization activity in our private equity portfolio, and are expected to continue to be smaller in size and number compared to prior periods.

fees and other, net the increase for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in management fees, partially offset by a decrease in transaction fees, net of fee credits. the increase in management fees was primarily due to (i) an increase in fees earned from bdcs advised by fs/kkr advisor resulting in part from the completion of the fs investments transaction in the second quarter of 2018, (ii) increased fees from our hedge fund partnerships as a result of greater fpaum, and (iii) an increase in fees in our special situations fund ii as a result of increased capital invested. as a result of the closing of the fs investments transaction on april 9, 2018, kkr began receiving its portion of the management and incentive fees on an additional $13.2 billion of fpaum (relating to fs investments' bdcs), which are reflected in our operating results beginning in the second quarter of 2018. these increases were partially offset by a reduction in management fees from prisma as a result of the paamco prisma transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2017. kkr reports its investment in paamco prisma using the equity method of accounting, and on a segment basis, kkr reflects its allocation of the net income of paamco prisma as management fees and realized incentive fees.  accordingly, the management fees and other revenues and expenses of prisma that had been reported on a gross basis prior to the closing of the transaction on june 1, 2017 are reflected on a net basis as part of our allocation of the net income of paamco prisma after june 1, 2017 resulting in a decrease in our reported gross management fees when compared to the prior period. the decrease in transaction fees was driven primarily by an $18.5 million breakup fee received in the year ended december 31, 2017 in connection with a terminated transaction and included in transaction fees, compared to no such breakup fees in the year ended december 31, 2018. the net amount of this fee attributable to us after credits to our fund limited partners was $4.6 million.
realized performance income the increase for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior period was primarily attributable to higher incentive fees received from bdcs advised or sub-advised by kkr driven in part by the completion of the fs investments transaction in the second quarter of 2018, and to a lesser extent, higher incentive fees earned in our hedge fund partnerships and realized carried interest earned in our special situations strategy.

transaction fees increased due primarily to an increase in both the size and number of capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. overall, we completed 204 capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2018, of which 28 represented equity offerings and 176 represented debt offerings, as compared to 193 transactions for the year ended december 31, 2017, of which 26 represented equity offerings and 167 represented debt offerings. our capital markets fees are generated in connection with our private markets and public markets business lines as well as from third-party companies. for the year ended december 31, 2018, approximately 18% of our transaction fees were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 23% for the year ended december 31, 2017. our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from north america, europe and asia-pacific. for the year ended december 31, 2018, approximately 30% of our transaction fees were generated outside of north america as compared to approximately 49% for the year ended december 31, 2017. our capital markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. our capital markets business line does not generate management or monitoring fees.

(1)   given the extraordinary nature of the conversion, the reported segment financial results for the year ended december 31, 2018 exclude approximately $729.4 million of losses on certain investments which were realized in the second quarter in advance of the conversion.
realized investment income the increase is primarily due to an increased level of net realized gains and an increase in interest income and dividends during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the prior period.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, net realized gains were comprised primarily of gains from the sale of private markets investments including the sales or partial sales of our investments in first data corporation, next issue media llc (technology sector), and national vision holdings, inc., as well as the sale of our equity interest in nephila and the sale of our alternative credit investment in amedisys, inc. (nasdaq: amed). offsetting these realized gains were realized losses, the most significant of which was a realized loss on preferred proppants, llc. given the extraordinary nature of the conversion, the reported segment financial results for the year ended december 31, 2018 exclude approximately $729.4 million of realized losses on certain investments, primarily credit and energy investments, which were realized in the second quarter of 2018 in advance of the conversion.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, net realized gains were comprised of gains primarily from the sale of private equity investments including the sales or partial sales of hca holdings, inc., walgreens boots alliance, inc., and visma as (technology sector), partially offset by losses on the sale of fortune creek partnership and the restructurings of algeco scotsman (industrial sector) and aurora eaglebine.

for the year ended december 31, 2018, interest income and dividends were comprised of (i) $174.4 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from our public markets investments, including clos and other credit investments and, to a lesser extent, our capital markets business and our cash balances and (ii) $112.1 million of dividend income from distributions received primarily through our real assets investments, including our real estate investment in kref and our energy investments, as well as our credit investments.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, interest income and dividends were comprised of (i) $163.4 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from our public markets investments, including clos and other credit investments and, to a lesser extent, our india debt financing company and our cash balances and (ii) $122.3 million of dividend income from distributions received primarily through our private equity investments and real estate investments, including our investment in kref.
subsequent to december 31, 2018, we completed, or expect to complete sales, partial sales or secondary sales with respect to certain private equity portfolio companies and other investments as well as other realization activities such as the receipt of dividends and interest income across our broader portfolio. the most significant of these transactions are sedgwick claims management services, inc., united group b.v. (telecom sector), and mmi holdings limited (technology sector). these realization activities, if and when completed, are expected to result in realized performance income and realized investment income of approximately $400 million. some of these transactions are not complete, and are subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions; there can be no assurance if or when any of these transactions will be completed.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the increase for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior period was due primarily to higher compensation recorded in connection with higher total segment revenues and includes higher equity-based compensation charges resulting from an increase in the weighted average number of unvested shares outstanding.
occupancy and other operating expenses the increase for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a higher level of expenses that are creditable to our investment funds, which includes broken-deal expenses, and a higher level of professional fees and other administrative costs in connection with the growth of the firm. the level of broken-deal expenses can vary significantly period to period based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are the number of potential investments being pursued for our investment funds, the size and complexity of investments being pursued and the number of investment funds currently in their investment period.
interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 interest expense relates primarily to the senior notes outstanding for kkr and kfn. the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior period is due to overall higher levels of borrowings, in particular at our capital markets business line under a revolving credit agreement.
income taxes paid the increase in income taxes paid is primarily due to a higher level of income that is subject to corporate taxes following the conversion. prior to the conversion, kkr's investment income and carried interest generally were not subject to u.s. corporate income taxes. subsequent to the conversion, all income earned by kkr is subject to u.s. corporate income taxes which we believe will result in an overall higher income taxes paid when compared to periods prior to the conversion. as a result of the conversion, kkr recognized a partial step-up in the tax basis of certain assets that will be recovered as those assets are sold or the basis is amortized. this generally results in a lower level of taxable gains upon realization of carried interest and investment income for those assets that existed on the date of the conversion. over time as these assets with higher tax basis are realized, we expect that our income taxes paid and segment effective tax rate will increase. the pace of such increase is not currently known and is dependent on a variety of factors including the pace at which the assets with higher tax basis are realized and the mix of all assets realized in any given period. therefore, we cannot predict what the increase, if any, in income taxes paid will be quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year.
121
after-tax distributable earnings the net increase in after-tax distributable earnings for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior period was due primarily to higher transaction fees, realized investment income, management fees and realized performance income, partially offset by a higher level of compensation expense and income taxes paid in the current period compared to the prior period.

aum for the private markets business line was $103.4 billion at december 31, 2018, an increase of $5.9 billion, compared to $97.5 billion at december 31, 2017.
the increase was primarily attributable to (i) new capital raised in our global infrastructure investors iii fund and our european fund v and (ii) to a lesser extent, an increase in the value of our private markets portfolio. these increases were partially offset by distributions to private markets fund investors primarily as a result of realizations, most notably in our north america fund xi, 2006 fund, and european fund iii.
the increase in the value of our private markets portfolio was driven primarily by net gains of $0.4 billion in each of our european fund iv, european fund iii, 2006 fund and asian fund iii and $0.2 billion in each of our global infrastructure investors ii fund, americas fund xii and next generation technology growth fund.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 5.1%. this was comprised of a 12.3% increase in value of our privately held investments and a 7.9% decrease in the share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments.

relating primarily to arbor pharmaceuticals, inc. (health care sector), resource environmental solutions, llc (energy sector), and mandala energy ltd. (energy sector). the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) in the case of sedgwick claims management services, inc. and cognita schools ltd, a valuation that reflects an agreement to sell these investments, (ii) an increase in the value of market comparables, and (iii) individual company performance. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook and (ii) a decrease in the value of market comparables.
the most significant decreases in share prices for the year ended december 31, 2018 of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were losses in gardner denver holdings, inc., brightview holdings, inc., and national vision holdings, inc. these decreases were partially offset by increases in share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains in first data corporation, go daddy inc., and pt japfa comfeed indonesia tbk. (idx: jpfa).
for the year ended december 31, 2017, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 23.3%. this was comprised of a 34.6% increase in the share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments and a 16.7% increase in value of our privately held investments. additionally, our infrastructure investment portfolio, which is comprised predominately of private investments, increased 21.7%.
the most significant increases in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were gains in gardner denver holdings, inc., national vision holdings, inc., and qingdao haier co., ltd. (ch: 600690) these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were losses in fujian sunner development co. ltd.

our privately held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to internet brands, inc., weld north holdings llc (education sector), and aricent group (technology sector). the unrealized gains on our privately held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to academy ltd. (retail sector), toys r us, inc. (retail sector), and santanol pty ltd (forestry sector). the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) in the case of weld north holdings llc and aricent group, valuations that reflect agreements to sell all or a portion of these investments, (ii) an increase in the value of market comparables and (iii) individual company performance. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook and (ii) a decrease in the value of market comparables.
certain investments included in our aum are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. those investments expose our aum to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the investments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. we generally seek to reduce these risks by employing hedging techniques in connection with certain investments, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which the investments are denominated. we do not, however, hedge our currency exposure in all currencies or for all investments. see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-exchange rate risk" and "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage-we make investments in companies that are based outside of the united states, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the united states."

investments transaction, (ii) a $1.9 billion increase in our pro rata portion of fpaum managed by marshall wace in connection with the acquisition of an additional 5% interest in this hedge fund partnership and (iii) a $3.1 billion decrease of fpaum in connection with the sale of our equity interest in nephila. partially offsetting these increases were (i) redemptions and distributions from certain investment vehicles across multiple strategies, primarily with our hedge fund partnerships, our private credit strategies, and certain leveraged credit strategies and (ii) decreases in value relating primarily to our hedge fund partnerships and our bdcs.
uncalled commitments private markets as of december 31, 2018, our private markets business line had $48.2 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $47.4 billion as of december 31, 2017. the increase is due primarily to new capital raised in our global infrastructure investors iii fund and european fund v, partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.
public markets as of december 31, 2018, our public markets business line had $9.8 billion of uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $9.1 billion as of december 31, 2017. the increase is due to new capital raised primarily in our direct lending strategies, partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.
capital invested and syndicated capital private markets capital invested for the year ended december 31, 2018, private markets had $13.2 billion of capital invested as compared to $13.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017. the decrease was driven primarily by a $0.4 billion decrease in capital invested in our private equity platform (including core investments and growth equity), partially offset by a $0.3 billion increase in capital invested in our real assets platforms. generally, the portfolio companies acquired through our private equity funds have higher transaction values and result in higher capital invested relative to transactions in our real assets funds. the number of large private equity investments made in any quarterly or year-to-date period is volatile and, consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one period or a few periods may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future periods. during the year ended december 31, 2018, 64% of capital deployed in private equity, which includes core and growth equity investments, was in transactions in north america, 24% was in the asia-pacific region and 12% was in europe. as of february 1, 2019, our private markets business line had announced transactions that were subject to closing conditions which aggregated approximately $3.9 billion. these transactions are generally subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions prior to their completion, and there can be no assurance if or when any of these transactions will be completed.
public markets capital invested for the year ended december 31, 2018, public markets had $6.9 billion of capital invested as compared to $5.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to a higher level of net capital deployed in our direct lending and private opportunistic credit strategies.
capital markets syndicated capital for the year ended december 31, 2018, capital markets syndicated $6.3 billion of capital as compared to $4.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to an increase in the size and number of syndication transactions in the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. overall, we completed 16 syndication transactions for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to 15 syndications for the year ended december 31, 2017. the size and frequency of syndication transactions depend in large part on market conditions and other factors that are unpredictable and outside our control, which may negatively impact the fees generated by our capital markets business from syndication transactions.

fees and other, net the net increase was primarily due to an increase in transaction fees, partially offset by a corresponding increase in fee credits, and an increase in management fees.
the increase in transaction fees was primarily attributable to an increase in both the number and size of transaction fee-generating investments. during the year ended december 31, 2017, there were 46 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $6.3 million compared to 35 transaction fee-generating investments paying an average fee of $3.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2016. approximately 44% of these transaction fees were paid by companies located in north america, 32% were paid from companies located in the asia-pacific region and 24% were paid from companies in europe. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and kkr's role in the transaction. the increase in fee credits is due primarily to a higher level of transaction fees.
the increase in management fees was primarily due to (i) americas fund xii entering its investment period in the first quarter of 2017, in which it earns management fees on a larger pool of capital than its predecessor fund north america fund xi, which entered its post-investment period, (ii) asian fund iii entering its investment period in the second quarter of 2017, in which it earns management fees on a larger pool of capital than its predecessor fund asian fund ii, which entered its post-investment period and (iii) new capital raised in our health care strategic growth fund. this net increase was partially offset by decreases due to (i) north america fund xi and asian fund ii entering their post-investment periods during 2017, in which they earn fees at a lower rate and based on invested capital rather than committed capital, and (ii) lower invested capital as a result of realizations primarily in our 2006 fund, china growth fund and asian fund.
recurring monitoring fees increased $12.4 million, which was primarily the result of an increase in the number of portfolio companies paying monitoring fees. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we had 66 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $0.9 million compared with 53 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $0.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we also received termination payments of $19.6 million in connection with the initial public offerings of gardner denver holdings, inc. and national vision holdings, inc. compared to $15.3 million of termination payments received in the year ended december 31, 2016 in connection with the initial public offering of us foods holding corp. these termination payments may occur in the future; however, they
127
are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with the initial public offering and other realization activity in our private equity portfolio, and are expected to continue to be smaller in size and number compared to prior periods.

fees and other, net the net increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in transaction fees, partially offset by a corresponding increase in fee credits and a decrease in management fees. the increase in transaction fees was driven primarily by an $18.5 million breakup fee received in the year ended december 31, 2017 in connection with a terminated transaction, compared to having received no such breakup fees in the year ended december 31, 2016. the net amount of this fee attributable to us after credits to our fund investors was $4.6 million. the decrease in management fees related primarily to a reduction in management fees from prisma as a result of the paamco prisma transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2017. kkr reports its investment in paamco prisma using the equity method of accounting, and on a segment basis, kkr reflects its allocation of the net income of paamco prisma as management fees and realized incentive fees.  accordingly, the management fees and other revenues and expenses of prisma that had been reported on a gross basis prior to the closing of the transaction on june 1, 2017 are reflected on a net basis as part of our allocation of the net income of paamco prisma after june 1, 2017 resulting in a decrease in our reported gross management fees when compared to the prior period. this decrease was partially offset by capital invested in our special situations fund ii, lending partners ii fund, and lending partners europe fund as well as an increase in management fees in certain separately managed accounts and with our hedge fund partnerships.
realized performance income the net increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior period was primarily attributable to higher incentive fees earned in our hedge fund partnerships, which were partially offset by lower incentive fees received from bdcs advised or sub-advised by kkr and a lower level of realized carried interest.

transaction fees increased due primarily to an increase in both the size and number of capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. overall, we completed 193 capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2017, of which 26 represented equity offerings and 167 represented debt offerings, as compared to 117 transactions for the year ended december 31, 2016, of which 11 represented equity offerings and 106 represented debt offerings. we earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. while each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. our capital markets fees are generated in connection with our private markets and public markets businesses as well as from third-party companies. for the year ended december 31, 2017, approximately 23% of our transaction fees were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 28% for the year ended december 31, 2016. our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from north america, europe, and asia-pacific, including india. for the year ended december 31, 2017, approximately 49% of our transaction fees were generated outside of north america as compared to approximately 34% for the year ended december 31, 2016. our capital markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. our capital markets business line does not generate management or monitoring fees.

realized investment income the decrease is primarily due to a lower level of net realized gains and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in interest income and dividends during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior period.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, net realized gains were comprised primarily of gains from the sale of private markets investments including the sales or partial sales of hca holdings, inc., walgreens boots alliance, inc. and visma as, partially offset by losses on the sale of fortune creek partnership and the restructurings of algeco scotsman and aurora eaglebine.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, net realized gains were primarily comprised of gains from the sale of private equity investments including the sales or partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, inc., hca holdings, inc., and zimmer biomet holdings, inc., offset by our investment in samson resources of approximately $254 million, the loss from the redemption of limited partner interests in a fund managed by blackgold capital management, as well as certain clos being called. as of december 31, 2016, kkr no longer holds any limited partner interests in blackgold capital management, although we continue to own an interest in its management company and fund general partner.
130
for the year ended december 31, 2017, interest income and dividends were comprised of (i) $163.4 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from our public markets investments including clos and other credit investments and to a lesser extent our capital markets business and our cash balances and (ii) $122.3 million of dividend income from distributions received primarily through our private equity investments and real estate investments including our investment in kref.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, interest income and dividends were comprised of (i) $186.7 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from our public markets investments including clos and other credit investments and to a lesser extent our cash balances and other assets and (ii) $136.2 million of dividend income from distributions received primarily through our private equity investments, real estate investments including our investment in kref and public markets investments.
the decrease in interest income and dividends is due primarily to the impact of a lower amount of capital invested in clos as well as a lower level of dividends for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior period.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior period was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expenses recorded in connection with higher total segment revenues, as well as higher equity-based compensation charges resulting from an increase in the weighted average number of unvested shares outstanding.
occupancy and other operating expenses the net increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior period was primarily due to higher professional fees and other administrative costs in connection with the growth of the firm, partially offset by a decrease in expenses that are creditable to our investment funds, which includes broken-deal expenses.
interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, interest expense relates primarily to the senior notes outstanding for kkr and kfn. the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior period is due to the redemption of kfn's 8.375% senior notes due 2041 and other debt after the third quarter of 2016, a portion of which was replaced with the issuance of kfn's 5.200% senior notes due 2033, which bears a lower rate of interest.
after-tax distributable earnings the net increase in after-tax distributable earnings for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior period was due primarily to higher transaction fees and management fees. these increases were partially offset primarily by a lower level of realized investment income and a higher level of compensation and benefits expense in the current period compared to the prior period.

aum for the private markets segment was $97.5 billion at december 31, 2017, an increase of $23.7 billion, compared to $73.8 billion at december 31, 2016.
the increase was primarily attributable to (i) new capital raised primarily in our asian fund iii, our core investment vehicles, two new strategic investor partnerships, our real estate partners americas ii fund and our real estate credit opportunity partners fund and (ii) to a lesser extent, an increase in the value of our private markets portfolio.
these increases were partially offset by (i) distributions to private markets fund investors primarily as a result of realizations most notably in our 2006 fund, european fund iii and north america fund xi, and (ii) a decrease of $0.8 billion reflecting expired commitments that are no longer eligible to be called for investments. our flagship private equity funds, such as our asian fund iii which represents $9.0 billion of aum at december 31, 2017, are raised only episodically toward the end of the investment period of their predecessor funds or when their predecessor funds' capital becomes largely invested or allocated for investment.
the increase in the value of our private markets portfolio was driven primarily by net gains of $4.3 billion in our north america fund xi, $1.0 billion in each of our european fund iv and european fund iii, $0.9 billion in our 2006 fund and $0.8 billion in our asian fund ii.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 23.3%. this was comprised of a 34.6% increase in the share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments and a 16.7% increase in value of our privately held investments. additionally, our infrastructure investment portfolio, which is comprised predominately of private investments, increased 21.7%.
the most significant increases in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were gains in gardner denver holdings, inc., national vision holdings, inc., and qingdao haier co., ltd. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were losses in fujian sunner development co. ltd., laureate education, inc., and engility holdings, inc.
our privately held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to internet brands, inc., weld north holdings llc, and aricent group. the unrealized gains on our privately held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to academy ltd., toys r us, inc., and santanol pty ltd (forestry sector). the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) in the case of weld north and aricent group, valuations that reflect agreements to sell all or a portion of these investments, (ii) an increase in the value of market comparables, and (iii) individual company performance. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook and (ii) a decrease in the value of market comparables.

certain investments included in our aum are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. those investments expose our aum to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the investments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. our policy is generally to reduce these risks in certain cases by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which the investments are denominated. we do not, however, hedge our currency exposure in all currencies or for all investments. see "-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-exchange rate risk" and "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage-we make investments in companies that are based outside of the united states, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the united states."

aum in our public markets segment totaled $70.9 billion at december 31, 2017, an increase of $15.2 billion compared to aum of $55.7 billion at december 31, 2016. the increase for the period was primarily due to new capital raised across multiple strategies most notably $3.5 billion in certain leveraged credit strategies, $2.9 billion with our hedge fund partnerships, $2.4 billion in our clos, $1.5 billion in our private opportunistic credit strategy, $1.4 billion in two new strategic investor partnerships and $0.8 billion in our lending partners iii fund. the "impact of other transactions" represents the closing of the paamco prisma transaction. this resulted in a net increase of approximately $3.8 billion reflecting the excess of our pro rata portion of the aum of paamco prisma over the historical aum of prisma. for the year ended december 31, 2017, new capital raised offset redemptions with our hedge fund partnerships. the "acquisitions" activity represents the increase in our pro rata portion of the aum of marshall wace in connection with the acquisition of an additional 5% interest in this hedge fund partnership. the increases due to change in value were driven primarily by our hedge fund partnerships, our domestic private credit strategies and our european clos and certain european leveraged credit strategies. partially offsetting these increases were redemptions and distributions from certain investment vehicles across multiple strategies, primarily with our hedge fund partnerships, our private credit strategies and our clos.

fpaum in our private markets segment was $61.7 billion at december 31, 2017, an increase of $9.5 billion, compared to $52.2 billion at december 31, 2016.
the increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised in our asian fund iii and our real estate partners americas ii fund and capital invested in our asian fund ii and north america fund xi. these increases were partially offset by (i) distributions and other activity primarily relating to realizations in our 2006 fund and european fund iii and (ii) net changes in the fee base of our asian fund ii as a result of it entering into its post-investment period, during which it earns fees at a lower rate based on invested capital rather than committed capital.

fpaum in our public markets segment was $55.8 billion at december 31, 2017, an increase of $6.5 billion compared to fpaum of $49.3 billion at december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to new capital raised across multiple strategies, most notably $2.9 billion with our hedge fund partnerships, $2.7 billion in certain leveraged credit strategies, $2.4 billion in our clos, $1.1 billion in our special situations fund ii and $1.2 billion in our direct lending strategies. new capital raised includes capital that was raised in previous periods but began earning fees upon deployment of capital. for the year ended december 31, 2017, new capital raised offset redemptions with our hedge fund partnerships. change in value was driven primarily by $1.1 billion through our hedge fund partnerships, $0.7 billion in certain leveraged credit strategies and $0.6 billion in our european clos. partially offsetting these increases were redemptions and distributions from certain investment vehicles across multiple strategies driven by $2.9 billion from our hedge fund partnerships, $3.2 billion from our private credit strategies and $1.3 billion from our clos. the "impact of other transactions" represents the closing of the paamco prisma transaction. this resulted in a net decrease of approximately $1.6 billion reflecting the excess of our historical fpaum of prisma, over our pro rata portion of the fpaum of paamco prisma. fpaum excludes assets under advisement of paamco prisma. the "acquisitions" activity represents the increase in our pro rata portion of the aum of marshall wace in connection with the acquisition of an additional 5% interest in this hedge fund partnership.
uncalled commitments private markets as of december 31, 2017, our private markets segment had $47.4 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. the increase from december 31, 2016 is due primarily to new capital
134
raised in our asian fund iii, our core investment vehicles, two new strategic investor partnerships and real estate partners americas ii, partially offset by capital called from fund investors to fund investments during the period.
public markets as of december 31, 2017, our public markets segment had $9.1 billion of uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. the increase from december 31, 2016 is due to new capital raised primarily in our private opportunistic credit strategy, two new strategic investor partnerships and lending partners iii fund, partially offset by capital called from fund investors to fund investments during the period.
capital invested and syndicated capital private markets capital invested the increase was driven primarily by a $4.5 billion increase in capital invested in our private equity platform, which includes an increase in core equity investments of $1.0 billion consisting of an investment in usi, inc. and a $2.5 billion increase in capital invested in our real assets and other platforms. generally, the portfolio companies acquired through our private equity funds have higher transaction values and result in higher capital invested relative to transactions in our real assets funds. the number of large private equity investments made in any quarter is volatile and consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one quarter or a few quarters may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future quarters. during the year ended december 31, 2017, 41% of capital deployed in private equity, which does not include core investments, was in transactions in north america, 37% was in the asia-pacific region and 22% was in europe.
public markets capital invested capital invested increased for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase is primarily due to a higher level of net capital deployed in our direct lending and special situations strategies.
capital markets syndicated capital the increase is primarily due to an increase in the size and number of syndication transactions in the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. overall, we completed 15 syndication transactions for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to eight syndications for the year ended december 31, 2016.

segment balance sheet our segment balance sheet is the balance sheet of kkr & co. inc. and its subsidiaries on a segment basis which includes, but is not limited to, our investment management companies, broker-dealer companies, general partners of our investment funds, and kfn. our segment balance sheet excludes the assets and liabilities of our investment funds and cfes and other consolidated entities that are not subsidiaries of kkr & co. inc.
investments investments is a term used solely for purposes of financial presentation of a portion of kkr's balance sheet and includes majority ownership of subsidiaries that operate kkr's asset management and other businesses, including the general partner interests of kkr's investment funds.
cash and short-term investments cash and short-term investments represent cash and liquid short-term investments in high-grade, short-duration cash management strategies used by kkr to generate additional yield on our excess liquidity and is used by management in evaluating kkr's liquidity position. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into kkr's available liquidity. cash and short-term investments differ from cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis as a result
135
of the inclusion of liquid short-term investments in cash and short-term investments. the impact that these liquid short-term investments have on cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities. accordingly, the exclusion of these investments from cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis has no impact on cash provided (used) by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities.

book value per outstanding adjusted share book value per outstanding adjusted share increased 9.6% from december 31, 2017. this increase was due primarily to a broad-based increase in the value of kkr's investment portfolio, including investments held directly by kkr as well as investments held through investment funds, such as kkr's private equity funds, where kkr is entitled to earn carried interest. for the year ended december 31, 2018, the value of kkr's balance sheet portfolio, on a segment basis, increased 7.1% and kkr's private equity portfolio increased 5.1%. the increase in kkr's balance sheet portfolio was primarily due to mark-to-market gains in our portfolio companies. for a further discussion, see "-consolidated results of operations-unrealized gains from investment activities" and "-consolidated results of operations-unrealized losses from investment activities." for a discussion of the changes in kkr's private equity portfolio, see "-segment analysis-other operating and performance measures-aum." the increase in book value per outstanding adjusted share was also due to approximately $1.6 billion of after-tax distributable earnings which were partially offset by dividends to class a common stockholders during the year ended december 31, 2018. effective as of september 30, 2018, kkr's segment balance sheet reflects kkr's tax assets and liabilities as prepared under gaap, which increased book value by approximately $160 million as of such date. for a discussion of factors that impacted kkr's after-tax distributable earnings, see "-segment analysis-segment results."

liquidity we manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds and cfes and the effect of changes in short term assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year. our primary cash flow activities on a segment basis typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends), as well as the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to, and advancing capital to, our funds and clos; (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products, and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions of other investments, assets, and businesses; (v) underwriting and funding commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our stockholders and holders of our series a and series b preferred stock; and (vii) paying borrowings, interest payments, and repayments under credit agreements, our senior notes, and other borrowing arrangements. see "-liquidity-liquidity needs-dividends."
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in clos; (iv) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets, including the transfers of investments for fund formations; and (v) borrowings under our credit facilities, debt offerings, and other borrowing arrangements. in addition, we may generate cash proceeds from sales of our equity securities.
many of our investment funds provide carried interest. with respect to our private equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. as of december 31, 2018, certain of our funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above,
140
but did not meet the third criteria. in these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. for a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a "netting hole." when netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. a fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest. strategic investor partnerships with fund investors may require netting across the various funds in which they invest, which may reduce the carried interest we otherwise would have earned if such fund investors were to have invested in our funds without the existence of the strategic investor partnership. see "risk factors-risks related to our business-strategic investor partnerships have longer investment periods and invest in multiple strategies, which may increase the possibility of a 'netting hole,' which will result in less carried interest for us, as well as clawback liabilities."
as of december 31, 2018, netting holes in excess of $50 million existed at one of our private equity funds, which was north america fund xi, which had a netting hole of approximately $73 million. in accordance with the criteria set forth above, other funds currently have and may in the future develop netting holes, and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future.
we have access to funding under various credit facilities, other borrowing arrangements and other sources of liquidity that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. the following describes these sources of liquidity.
revolving credit agreements, senior notes, kfn debt obligations & kfn securities for a discussion of kkr's debt obligations, including our revolving credit agreements, senior notes, kfn debt obligations, and kfn securities, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 10 "debt obligations."
preferred stock for a discussion of kkr's equity, including our preferred stock, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 15 "equity."
liquidity needs we expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to:
•   continue to grow our business lines, including seeding new strategies, funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies and otherwise supporting investment vehicles which we sponsor;
•   warehouse investments in portfolio companies or other investments for the benefit of one or more of our funds, vehicles, accounts or clos pending the contribution of committed capital by the investors in such vehicles, and advancing capital to them for operational or other needs;
•   service debt obligations including the payment of obligations upon maturity or redemption, as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments;
•   fund cash operating expenses and contingencies, including litigation matters;
•   payment of corporate income taxes following the conversion;
•   pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings;
•   pay cash dividends in accordance with our dividend policy for our class a common stock or the terms of our preferred stock;
•   underwrite commitments, advance loan proceeds and fund syndication commitments within our capital markets business;
•   make future purchase price payments in connection with our proprietary investments, such as our hedge fund partnership with marshall wace, to the extent not paid by newly issued class a common stock;
•   acquire other assets for our principal activities business line, including other businesses, investments and assets, some of which may be required to satisfy regulatory requirements for our capital markets business or risk retention requirements for clos (to the extent it continues to apply); and
•   repurchase kkr's class a common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program or other securities issued by kkr.
kkr & co. inc. share repurchase program on october 27, 2015, kkr announced the authorization of a program providing for the repurchase by kkr of up to $500 million in the aggregate of its outstanding shares of class a common stock. on february 9, 2017, kkr announced the authorization for kkr to repurchase an incremental $250 million under this unit repurchase program. on may 3, 2018, kkr announced the increase of the available amount under its repurchase program to $500 million, which may be used for the repurchase of its class a common stock and the retirement of equity awards issued pursuant to our equity incentive plan (and any successor equity plan thereto). during the fourth quarter of 2018, kkr repurchased 4.2 million shares for approximately $93 million and retired 1.6 million equity awards for approximately $46 million. as of december 31, 2018, approximately $868 million has been spent since october 27, 2015, representing a total of 51.8 million shares, to either repurchase shares or retire equity awards. as of december 31, 2018, approximately $282 million is available under the repurchase program.
under the current repurchase program, kkr is authorized to repurchase its class a common stock from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the timing, manner, price and amount of any class a common stock repurchases will be determined by kkr in its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. kkr expects that the program, which has no expiration date, will be in effect until the maximum approved dollar amount has been used. the program does not require kkr to repurchase any specific number of shares of class a common stock, and the program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time.
in addition to the purchases of class a common stock as described above, the repurchase program will be used for the retirement (by cash settlement or the payment of tax withholding amounts upon net settlement) of equity awards issued pursuant to our equity incentive plan (and any successor equity plan thereto) representing the right to receive class a common stock. see item 5. "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities."

capital commitments the agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which usually range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing; however, the size of our general partner commitment to certain funds pursuing newer strategies may exceed this range. the following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds as of december 31, 2018:

other commitments in addition to the uncalled commitments to our investment funds as shown above, kkr has entered into contractual commitments with respect to (i) the purchase of investments and other assets primarily in our principal activities business line and (ii) underwriting transactions, debt financing, and syndications in our capital markets business line. as of december 31, 2018, these commitments amounted to $370.5 million and $663.7 million, respectively. whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part, depends on the contractual terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to closing or funding. the unfunded commitments shown for our capital markets business line are shown without reflecting arrangements that may reduce the actual amount of contractual commitments shown occurring after december 31, 2018. our capital markets business has an arrangement with a third party, which reduces our risk when underwriting certain debt transactions, and thus our unfunded commitments as of december 31, 2018 are reduced to reflect the amount to be funded by such third party. in the case of purchases of investments or assets in our principal activities business line, the amount to be funded includes amounts that are intended to be syndicated to third parties, and the actual amounts to be funded may be less than shown.
investment in marshall wace in connection with our investment in marshall wace, either of marshall wace or kkr may, in the fourth quarter of 2019, exercise a put option or a call option, respectively, that would give kkr an incremental 5% equity interest in marshall wace. kkr currently holds an ownership interest of 34.6%. the exercise of such options would require the use of cash and/or kkr

class a common stock. for further information on this and prior option exercises, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 4 "investments-equity method."
tax receivable agreement we may be required to acquire kkr group partnership units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with kkr holdings, which may result in an increase in our tax basis of the assets of the kkr group partnerships at the time of an exchange of kkr group partnership units. we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings, which requires us to pay to kkr holdings, or to current and former principals who have exchanged kkr holdings units for kkr class a common stock as transferees of kkr group partnership units, 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in u.s. federal, state and local income tax that we realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings we realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. for the full description of the tax receivable agreement and our obligations thereunder, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 13 "related party transactions-tax receivable agreement," and for a discussion of amounts payable and cumulative cash payments made under the tax receivable agreement see "-liquidity-other liquidity needs-contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies."
following the conversion, we expect the amount of future payments under the tax receivable agreement to be materially higher than it would have been had we not converted to a corporation. in addition, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement would be effectively accelerated in the event of an early termination of the tax receivable agreement by us or in the event of certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. see "risk factors-risks related to our organization-we will be required to pay our principals for most of the benefits relating to our use of tax attributes we receive from prior and future exchanges of our class a common stock for kkr group partnership units and related transactions."
dividends a dividend of $0.125 per share of class a common stock has been declared, which will be paid on february 26, 2019 to holders of record of class a common stock as of the close of business on february 11, 2019.
a dividend of $0.421875 per share of series a preferred stock has been declared and set aside for payment on march 15, 2019 to holders of record of series a preferred stock as of the close of business on march 1, 2019. a dividend of $0.406250 per share of series b preferred stock has been declared and set aside for payment on march 15, 2019 to holders of record of series b preferred stock as of the close of business on march 1, 2019.
when kkr & co. inc. receives distributions from the kkr group partnerships (the holding companies of the kkr business), kkr holdings receives its pro rata share of such distributions from the kkr group partnerships.
the declaration and payment of dividends to our class a common stockholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time. as a corporation, we expect our dividends to our class a common stockholders, if declared, to be lower than the distribution amounts we declared in prior periods as a limited partnership. our distribution policy as a limited partnership had been to pay annual aggregate distributions to holders of our common units of $0.68 per common unit, and our dividend policy after the conversion and beginning with respect to the third quarter of 2018 is to pay dividends to holders of our class a common stock in an initial annual aggregate amount of $0.50 per share (or a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share), in each case, subject to the discretion of our board of directors based on a number of factors, including kkr's future financial performance and other considerations that the board deems relevant, and compliance with the terms of kkr & co. inc.'s certificate of incorporation and applicable law. for u.s. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay following july 1, 2018 (including dividends on our preferred stock) generally will be treated as qualified dividend income for u.s. individual stockholders to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for u.s. federal income tax purposes. no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits of kkr will flow through to the stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes following july 1, 2018. there can be no assurance that future dividends will be made as intended or at all or that any particular dividend policy for our class a common stock will be maintained. furthermore, the declaration and payment of distributions by the kkr group partnerships and our other subsidiaries may also be subject to legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions, including restrictions contained in our debt agreements and the terms of the preferred stock of the kkr group partnerships.
143
other liquidity needs we may also be required to fund various underwriting, syndication and fronting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments, which has increased in significance in recent periods and may continue to be significant in future periods. we generally expect that these commitments will be syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment.
contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds and cfes enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. the following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of december 31, 2018 excluding consolidated funds and cfes with a reconciliation of such amounts to the anticipated future cash payments of kkr including consolidated funds and cfes.

(1)   these uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. however, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. see "-liquidity-liquidity needs."
(2)   amounts include: (i) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2020 issued by kkr group finance co. llc, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior notes due 2043 issued by kkr group finance co. ii llc and $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2044 issued by kkr group finance co. iii llc, gross of unamortized discount; (ii) $367.8 million aggregate principal amount of 0.509% senior notes due 2023, 0.764% senior notes due 2025 and 1.595% senior notes due 2038 issued by kkr group finance co. iv llc (denominated in japanese yen); (iii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of kfn 2032 senior notes, gross of unamortized discount; (iv) $120 million aggregate principal amount of kfn 2033 senior notes; (v) $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of kfn 5.400% senior notes due 2033 and (vi) $258.5 million aggregate principal amount of kfn junior subordinated notes, gross of unamortized discount. kfn's debt obligations are non-recourse to kkr beyond the assets of kfn.
(3)   these interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at december 31, 2018 is not repaid until its maturity. future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of december 31, 2018, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. the amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.

(8)   represents uncalled commitments of our consolidated funds excluding kkr's portion of uncalled commitments as the general partner of the respective funds. because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. however, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. see "-liquidity-liquidity needs."
(9)   amounts include (i) financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds with the objective of providing liquidity to the funds of $4.2 billion, (ii) debt securities issued by our consolidated clos of $12.5 billion, (iii) debt securities issued by our consolidated cmbs entities of $1.9 billion and (iv) borrowings collateralized by specific investments and other assets held directly by majority-owned investment vehicles of $0.7 billion. in april 2018, a consolidated entity of kkr sold its controlling beneficial interest in four consolidated cmbs vehicles. debt securities issued by consolidated clos and cmbs entities are supported solely by the investments held at the clo and cmbs vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other kkr entity. obligations under financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro rata equity interest in such funds. our management companies bear no obligations to repay any financing arrangements at our consolidated funds.
(10)   the interest obligations on debt of our cfes and other borrowings represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at december 31, 2018 is not repaid until its maturity. future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of december 31, 2018, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. the amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.
(11)   represents commitments of consolidated funds to fund the purchase of various investments.
the commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. as of december 31, 2018, an undiscounted payable of $117.9 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. as of december 31, 2018, approximately $24.0 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. see "-liquidity needs-tax receivable agreement" and "part ii. item 1a. risk factors-we will be required to pay our principals for most of the benefits relating to our use of tax attributes we receive from prior and future exchanges of our class a common stock for kkr group partnership units and related transactions."
we may incur contingent liabilities for claims that may be made against us in the future. we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and covenants, including indemnifications. for example, certain of our investment funds and kfn have provided certain indemnities relating to environmental and other matters and have provided nonrecourse carve-out guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct and other customary wrongful acts, each in connection with the financing of certain real estate investments that we have made. kkr has also provided certain guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct, bankruptcy and other customary wrongful acts in connection with certain investment vehicles. kkr has also guaranteed certain of our employees' (other than our named executive officers) and consultants' personal loans obtained in connection with certain fund investments. we have also indemnified employees and non-employees against potential liabilities, in connection with their service as described under "item 13. certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence-indemnification of directors, officers and others." in addition, we have also provided credit support to certain of our subsidiaries' obligations in connection with certain investment vehicles or partnerships that we manage. for example, kkr has guaranteed the obligations of a general partner to post collateral on behalf of its investment vehicle in connection with such vehicle's derivative transactions, and we have also agreed to be liable for certain investment losses and/or for providing liquidity in the events specified in the governing documents of certain investment vehicles. our maximum exposure under these arrangements is currently unknown as our liabilities for these matters would require a claim to be made against us in the future.
the partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 16 "commitments and contingencies-contingent repayment guarantees" for further information on kkr's potential clawback obligations.
off balance sheet arrangements other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. however, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. if actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. we believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions.
the following discusses certain aspects of our critical accounting policies. for a full discussion of these and all critical accounting policies, see item 8. financial statements & supplementary data-note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies."
fair value measurements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. except for certain of kkr's equity method investments and debt obligations, kkr's investments and other financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts whose carrying values approximate fair value.
gaap establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. investments and financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:
level i pricing inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. the types of financial instruments included in this category are publicly-listed equities and securities sold short.
we classified 4.8% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level i at december 31, 2018.
level ii pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. the types of financial instruments included in this category are credit investments, investments and debt obligations of consolidated clo entities, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, less liquid and restricted equity securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives such as foreign currency option and forward contracts.
we classified 39.3% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level ii at december 31, 2018.
level iii pricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instruments and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. the types of financial instruments generally included in this category are private portfolio companies, real assets investments, credit investments, equity method investments for which the fair value option was elected and investments and debt obligations of consolidated cmbs entities.
we classified 55.9% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level iii at december 31, 2018. the valuation of our level iii investments at december 31, 2018 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments in an orderly transaction at such date.
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
146
level iii valuation methodologies with respect to our private equity portfolio, which includes growth equity investments, we generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of an investment. the first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures. the second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit ebitda multiples. in certain cases the results of the discounted cash flow approach can be significantly impacted by these estimates. other inputs are also used in both methodologies. also, as discussed in greater detail under "-business environment" and "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage-our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, but may have a significant adverse impact on the value of our investments" in this report, a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. in addition, when a definitive agreement has been executed to sell an investment, kkr generally considers a significant determinant of fair value to be the consideration to be received by kkr pursuant to the executed definitive agreement.
upon completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies, a weighting is ascribed to each method, and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate. the ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies, except that the value may be higher or lower than such range in the case of investments being sold pursuant to an executed definitive agreement.
across the total level iii private equity investment portfolio, including investments in both consolidated and unconsolidated investment funds, approximately 69% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. less than 2% of the fair value of this level iii private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. as of december 31, 2018, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology, and a methodology based on pending sales for this portfolio of level iii private equity investments were 41%, 47%, and 12%, respectively.
in the case of growth equity investments, enterprise values may be determined using the market comparables analysis and discounted cash flow analysis described above. a scenario analysis may also be conducted to subject the estimated enterprise values to a downside, base and upside case, which involves significant assumptions and judgments. a milestone analysis may also be conducted to assess the current level of progress towards value drivers that we have determined to be important, which involves significant assumptions and judgments. the enterprise value in each case may then be allocated across the investment's capital structure to reflect the terms of the security and subjected to probability weightings. in certain cases, the values of growth equity investments may be based on recent or expected financings.
real asset investments in infrastructure, energy and real estate are valued using one or more of the discounted cash flow analysis, market comparables analysis and direct income capitalization, which in each case incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. infrastructure investments are generally valued using the discounted cash flow analysis. key inputs used in this methodology can include the weighted average cost of capital and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit ebitda multiples. energy investments are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis. key inputs used in this methodology that require estimates include the weighted average cost of capital. in addition, the valuations of energy investments generally incorporate both commodity prices as quoted on indices and long-term commodity price forecasts, which may be substantially different from, and are currently higher than, commodity prices on certain indices for equivalent future dates. certain energy investments do not include an illiquidity discount. long-term commodity price forecasts are utilized to capture the value of the investments across a range of commodity prices within the energy investment portfolio associated with future development and to reflect a range of price expectations. real estate investments are generally valued using a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis. key inputs used in such methodologies that require estimates include an unlevered discount rate and current capitalization rate, and certain real estate investments do not include a minimum illiquidity discount. the valuations of real assets investments also use other inputs.
on a segment basis, our energy real asset investments in oil and gas-producing properties as of december 31, 2018 had a fair value of approximately $668 million. based on this fair value, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of these energy investments from one or more adverse movements to the investments' valuation inputs would result in a decline in book value of $66.8 million. as of december 31, 2018, if we were to value our energy investments using only the commodity prices as quoted on indices and did not use long-term commodity price forecasts, and also held all other inputs to their valuation constant, we estimate that book value would have been approximately $103 million lower.

these hypothetical declines relate only to book value. there would be no current impact on kkr's unrealized carried interest since all of the investment funds which hold these types of energy investments have investment values that are either below their cost or not currently accruing carried interest. additionally, there would be no impact on fees since fees earned from investment funds which hold investments in oil and gas-producing properties are based on either committed capital or capital invested.
for gaap purposes, where kkr holds energy investments consisting of working interests in oil and gas-producing properties directly and not through an investment fund, such working interests are consolidated based on the proportion of the working interests held by us. accordingly, we reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated working interests on a gross basis and changes in the value of these energy investments are not reflected as unrealized gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations. accordingly, a change in fair value for these investments does not result in a decrease in net gains (losses) from investment activities, but may result in an impairment charge reflected in general, administrative and other expenses. for segment purposes, these directly held working interests are treated as investments and changes in value are reflected in our segment results as unrealized gains and losses.
credit investments: credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not available, credit investments are generally valued by us based on ranges of valuations determined by an independent valuation firm. valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses, for which the key inputs are determined based on market comparables, which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers.
key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our level iii investment valuations as described above are included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 5 "fair value measurements."
level iii valuation process the valuation process involved for level iii measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of level iii investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review.
for private markets investments classified as level iii, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. kkr begins its procedures to determine the fair values of its level iii assets one month prior to the end of a reporting period, and kkr follows additional procedures to ensure that its determinations of fair value for its level iii assets are appropriate as of the relevant reporting date. these preliminary valuations are reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by kkr to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of kkr's valuations annually for all level iii investments in private markets and quarterly for investments other than certain investments, which have values less than preset value thresholds and which in the aggregate comprise less than 5% of the total value of kkr's level iii private markets investments. the valuations of certain real asset investments are determined solely by an independent valuation firm without the preparation of preliminary valuations by our investment professionals, and instead such independent valuation firm relies on valuation information available to it as a broker or valuation firm. for credit investments and debt obligations of consolidated cmbs vehicles, an independent valuation firm is generally engaged quarterly by kkr with respect to most investments classified as level iii. the valuation firm either provides a value or provides a valuation range from which kkr's investment professionals select a point in the range to determine the preliminary valuation or performs certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness and provide positive assurance of kkr's valuations. after reflecting any input from the independent valuation firm, the valuation proposals are submitted for review and approval by kkr's valuation committees. as of december 31, 2018, less than 4% of the total value of our level iii credit investments were not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm.
kkr has a global valuation committee that is responsible for coordinating and implementing the firm's valuation process to ensure consistency in the application of valuation principles across portfolio investments and between periods. the global valuation committee is assisted by the asset class-specific valuation committees that exist for private equity (including core investments), growth equity, real estate, energy and infrastructure and credit. the asset class-specific valuation committees are responsible for the review and approval of all preliminary level iii valuations in their respective asset classes on a quarterly basis. the members of these valuation committees are comprised of investment professionals, including the heads of each respective strategy, and professionals from business operations functions such as legal, compliance and finance, who are not primarily responsible for the management of the investments. for periods prior to the completion of the paamco prisma transaction, when level iii valuations were required to be performed on hedge fund investments, a valuation committee for hedge funds reviewed these valuations.
148
all level iii valuations are also subject to approval by the global valuation committee, which is comprised of senior employees including investment professionals and professionals from business operations functions, and includes one of kkr's co-presidents and co-chief operating officers and its chief financial officer, general counsel and chief compliance officer. when valuations are approved by the global valuation committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of level iii investments, as well as the valuations of level i and level ii investments, are presented to the audit committee of the board of directors of kkr & co. inc. and are then reported to the board of directors.
as of december 31, 2018, upon completion by, where applicable, an independent valuation firm of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them on certain investments, the independent valuation firm concluded that the fair values, as determined by kkr, of those investments reviewed by them were reasonable. the limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all level iii investments. we are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments.
as described above, level ii and level iii investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and stockholders' equity that we report from time to time.
changes in the fair value of investments impacts the amount of carried interest that is recognized as well as the amount of investment income that is recognized for investments held directly and through our consolidated funds as described below. we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments held directly and through consolidated investment funds generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities for investments held directly and through investment funds and a more significant impact to the amount of carried interest recognized, regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. with respect to consolidated investment funds, the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to kkr would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value of our consolidated funds would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments.
as of december 31, 2018, there were no investments which represented greater than 5% of total investments on a gaap basis. on a segment basis, as of december 31, 2018, investments which represented greater than 5% of total segment investments consisted of first data corporation and usi, inc. valued at $998.1 million and $650.1 million, respectively. our investment income on a gaap basis and our book value can be impacted by volatility in the public markets related to our holdings of publicly traded securities, including our sizable holdings of first data corporation. see "-business environment" for a discussion on the impact of global equity markets on our financial condition and "-segment balance sheet" for additional information regarding our largest holdings on a segment basis.
recognition of investment income investment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments; (ii) dividends; (iii) interest income; (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options, foreign denominated debt and debt securities issued by consolidated cfes.
certain of our investment funds are consolidated. when a fund is consolidated, the portion of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated financial statements. for funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to kkr's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. the carried interest that kkr retains in net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. inc. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. however, because certain of our funds remain consolidated and because we hold a minority economic interest in these funds' investments, our share of the investment income is less than the total amount of investment income presented in the consolidated financial statements for these consolidated funds.
149
recognition of carried interest in the statement of operations carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduces noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. carried interest is earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. if these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as losses in the statement of operations. for funds that are not consolidated, amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included in capital allocation-based income in the consolidated statements of operations. amounts earned pursuant to carried interest at consolidated funds are eliminated from fees and other upon consolidation of the fund and are included as investment income (loss) in net gains (losses) from investment activities along with all of the other investment gains and losses at the consolidated fund.
carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. due to the extended durations of our private equity funds, we believe that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds. amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. if these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. for funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. for funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
prior to january 1, 2016, most of our historical private equity funds that provide for carried interest do not have a preferred return. for these funds, the management company is required to refund up to 20% of any management fees earned from its limited partners in the event that the fund recognizes carried interest. at such time as the fund recognizes carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability due to the fund's limited partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the management fees earned. the refunds to the limited partners are paid, and liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investment is sold and the associated carried interest is realized. in the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the amount that represents 20% of the earned management fees, such management fees would be retained and not returned to the funds' limited partners.
most of our newer investment funds that provide for carried interest, however, have a preferred return. in this case, the management company does not refund the management fees earned from the limited partners of the fund as described above. instead, the management fee is effectively returned to the limited partners through a reduction of the realized gain on which carried interest is calculated. to calculate the carried interest, kkr calculates whether a preferred return has been achieved based on an amount that includes all of the management fees paid by the limited partners as well as the other capital contributions and expenses paid by them to date. to the extent the fund has exceeded the preferred return at the time of a realization event, and subject to any other conditions for the payment of carried interest like netting holes, carried interest is distributed to the general partner. until the preferred return is achieved, no carried interest is recorded. thereafter, the general partner is entitled to a catch up allocation such that the general partner's carried interest is paid in respect of all of the fund's net gains, including the net gains used to pay the preferred return, until the general partner has received the full percentage amount of carried interest that the general partner is entitled to under the terms of the fund. in general, investment funds that entitle the management company to receive an incentive fee have a preferred return and are calculated on a similar basis that takes into account management fees paid.

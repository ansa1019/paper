item 1a.   risk factors.

risk factors relating to our operations our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy, the impact of high energy and food costs, the increased cost of travel, the potential for continued bank failures, decreased disposable consumer income and wealth, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer. in addition, increases in gasoline prices, including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities, can adversely affect our operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices. further, security concerns, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel, discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and our business in particular. economic downturns, geopolitical events and other related factors which impact discretionary consumer spending and other economic events that are beyond our control have had direct effects on our business and the tourism industry in the past and could adversely affect us in the future.

we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue the gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate.  we compete with a variety of gaming operations, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals (vgts) at bars, restaurants and truck stops. we also compete, to a lesser extent, with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online gambling, bingo, pull tab games, card parlors, sports books, fantasy sports websites, "cruise-to-nowhere" operations, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, jai-alai, and, in the future, may compete with gaming at other venues. in addition, we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers.  certain of our competitors are large gaming companies with greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources.  in some instances, particularly in the case of native american casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes.  these factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment product that enable us to remain competitive.
in addition, states that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming, and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future. legalized casino gaming in these states and on native american reservations in or near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations. there has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes in prior years and expanded gaming is under consideration in certain of our markets. for example, gaming facilities in ohio that commenced operations in recent years present significant competition for mountaineer, presque isle downs, nemacolin and scioto downs. in addition, the governor of pennsylvania signed legislation in october 2017 expanding gaming to allow for up to ten additional casino locations, video gaming terminals (vgts) at truck stops, interactive gaming (igaming), gaming at airports and potentially sports wagering. in missouri, there are two proposals pending before the missouri general assembly for the expansion of gaming in the state.  the missouri sports betting bill would allow class b gaming licensees and daily fantasy sports licensees to conduct sports wagering including on mobile devices so long as such devices are located within the state of missouri.  the missouri video lottery terminal bill would allow the state lottery to operate video gaming terminals, similar to slot machines, at various locations distributed across the state including bars, restaurants, veterans and fraternal organizations and convenience stores throughout the state.  each of these bills are in the early stages of the law making process and subject to significant changes in proposed statutory language prior to enactment. any such expansion of legalized gaming could adversely impact our properties.
casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveport/bossier city and lake charles markets draw customers, primarily texas. the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming, and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on eldorado shreveport and lake charles. additionally, since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base in reno, we also compete with native american gaming operations in california. native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines, lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands. a number of native american tribes have established large-scale gaming facilities in california. additionally, from time to time the state of florida has entered into or amended gaming compacts with native american casinos or enacted, amended or discussed possible changes in gaming laws which could have positive or negative impacts on our pompano operations. in addition, various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada, new jersey, delaware, and pennsylvania, and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition.
increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities. because a significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and the master lease, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures. if we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position could be negatively affected.
14
our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties our operations in several jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties. if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted and, in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. for example, iowa law requires that each gambling venue in iowa must have a licensed "qualified sponsoring organization," or qso, which is a tax-exempt non-profit organization. the qso must donate the profits it receives from casino operations to educational, civic, public, charitable, patriotic or religious uses. both of our iowa properties have an agreement with a local qso. we have the right to renew our agreements for bettendorf and waterloo when they expire in 2025 and 2021, respectively.
the federal interstate horse racing act and the state racing laws in certain jurisdictions where we have racetracks require that, in order to simulcast races, we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at those racetracks or that we share proceeds of slot machines at the applicable racetrack. if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks, we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting, and may not be permitted to continue our gaming operations, at the applicable racetrack at those facilities, which could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
some of our casinos are located on leased property. if we default on one or more leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino.
we currently lease certain parcels of land on which several of our properties are located, including five of the properties that we acquired in the tropicana acquisition. as a ground lessee, we have the right to use the leased land; however, we do not hold fee ownership of the underlying land. accordingly, we have no interest in the leased land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases. moreover, since we do not completely control the land underlying the property, a landowner could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the long-term leases which are beyond our control.  if the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. our leases provide that they may be terminated for a number of reasons, including failure to pay rent, taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of other covenants contained in the leases. in particular, the master lease requires initial annual rent payments of at least $87.6 million, which is subject to escalation annually, and obligates us to make specified minimum capital expenditures with respect to the leased properties. if our business and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings, the payments required to service the rent obligations under the master lease could materially and adversely limit our ability to react to changes in our business and make acquisitions and investments in our properties. if we were to default on any one or more of these leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land, including the hotels and casinos. a termination of our ground leases or the master lease could result in a default under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. further, in the event that any lessor of our leased properties, including properties that are subject to the master lease, encounters financial, operational, regulatory or other challenges, there can be no assurance that such lessor will be able to comply with its obligations under the applicable lease.
certain of our leases, including the master lease, are "triple-net" leases. accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay, among other things, the following: (1) lease payments to the underlying ground lessor for properties that are subject to ground leases; (2) facility maintenance costs; (3) all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (4) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. we are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to the lessor as the owner of the associated facilities. in addition, we remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the master lease and other ground leases even if one or more of such leased facilities is unprofitable or if we decide to withdraw from those locations. we could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
15
we are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and licensing, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business licensing requirements.  the ownership and operation of casino gaming, riverboat and horse racing facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation, and regulatory authorities at the federal, state, and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines, and take other actions, each of which poses a significant risk to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations, but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals. any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended or interpreted differently, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us.
gaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may, in their discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective jurisdictions. further, the costs of any investigation conducted by any of the gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. if any of the gaming authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions, if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities.
our officers, directors, and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. if any of the applicable gaming authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. either result could materially adversely affect our gaming operations.
applicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities, incur debt and undertake other financing activities. such transactions would generally require approval of applicable gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. if state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationships with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.
compliance with other laws.  we are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that apply to non-gaming businesses, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing smoking and the serving of alcoholic beverages. legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in our jurisdictions, we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and, particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market, our business could be materially adversely affected. under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. we have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or the results of our operations. however, several of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years. as a consequence, it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that, as a result, environmental issues could arise in the future, the precise nature of which we cannot now predict. the coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with these laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs.
16
regulations adopted by fincen require us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. u.s. treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000, if we know, suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations. fincen has recently increased its focus on gaming companies.
we are required to report certain customer's gambling winnings via form w-2g to comply with current internal revenue service regulations. should these regulations change, we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements.
taxation and fees. in addition, gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. from time to time, federal, state, and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. in addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes, and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.
income taxes. we are subject to tax in multiple u.s. tax jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions. while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our provision for income taxes.
tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. the u.s. recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. in addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. if u.s. or state tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
we have partnership agreements to expand our sportsbook business and engage in online sportsbook, casino gaming and poker. there can be no assurance that regulations authorizing such activities will be approved in the jurisdictions in which we operate or that the market for such gaming activities will develop as expected.
during the second quarter of 2018, the u.s. supreme court overturned the federal ban on sports betting.  as a result, several jurisdictions in which we operate legalized sports betting and additional jurisdictions may do so in the future.  we currently accept wagers on sporting events in nevada, new jersey and west virginia and anticipate accepting wagers on sporting events during the first quarter of 2019 at our casinos located in pennsylvania and mississippi. however, our ability to expand our sports betting and online operations is dependent on adoption of regulations permitting sports betting in the united states and may be negatively impacted by a recent opinion of the u.s. justice department's office of legal counsel relating to the restrictions on online gaming under existing federal statutes. there can be no assurances when, or if, regulations enabling sports betting and online sportsbook, casino gaming and poker will be adopted, or the terms of such regulations, in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
17
following the repeal of the federal ban on sports betting, we entered into a definitive agreement with william hill pursuant to which william hill has agreed to operate as our sports betting operator, including with respect to mobile and online sports wagering, for a period of 25 years. we also entered into a 20-year agreement with tsg pursuant to which we agreed to provide tsg with options to obtain access to certain of our licenses for online sports wagering and real money online gaming and poker.  we received equity interests in william hill us, william hill plc and tsg in consideration for the execution of these agreements and we may in the future receive additional consideration, including revenue sharing based on the betting and gaming operations conducted under the authority of our licenses or in our markets.  to the extent permitted under our agreements with william hill and tsg, we will continue to evaluate options for additional partnerships to operate online betting and gaming activities under the authority of our licenses and may in the future enter into additional partnership agreements with respect to such operations.
the market for sports betting and online gaming is rapidly evolving and highly competitive with an increasing number of competitors. the success of our sportsbook and online betting and gaming partners, the value of our equity interests in william hill and tsg and the results of operations from sports betting and online sportsbook and gaming conducted at our properties or under the authority of our licenses are dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including:
•   the timing of adoption of regulations authorizing such betting and gaming activities and the restrictions contained in such regulations;

•   the tax rates and license fees applicable to such activities;

•   our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market;

•   the potential that the market does not develop at all or does not develop as we anticipate;

•   our ability to compete with new entrants in the market;

•   changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; and

•   the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment.

there can be no assurance as to the returns that we will receive from our current and anticipated sports betting and online gaming operations or our partnerships with william hill and tsg or future similar arrangements with other market service providers.
we rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks our future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees. we compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need. a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
in addition, the operation of our business requires qualified executives, managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities. there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets. in addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor, the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities, including the expansion of native american gaming, may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals. while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees, shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees, and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result.
work stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits as of december 31, 2018, we had 21 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 3,400 employees. a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. given the large number of employees, labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry, including at some of our properties. as a result, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future.
18
because we own real property, we will be subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. these laws and regulations are complex and frequently subject to change. in addition, our horse racing facilities are subject to laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations ("cafo") on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm water discharges. cafo regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. enforcement of cafo regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating, or contributing to remediation costs related to, contamination located at or near certain of our facilities, including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, required to manage, abate, remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations, mold, lead, asbestos‐containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. moreover, violations can result in significant fines or penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.
we are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment. certain of these laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from its property. the costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial.
an earthquake, hurricane, flood, other natural disaster, act of terrorism or other casualty events could adversely affect our business and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage to cover such losses the operations of our facilities are subject to disruption or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualty events, including acts of terrorism or violence. the reno area has been, and may in the future be, subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters and certain of our other properties are located in flood zones or are otherwise subject to significant disruption based on adverse weather conditions. because many of our gaming operations are located on or adjacent to bodies of water, these facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with other casinos, including loss of service due to casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, flood, hurricane or other severe weather conditions and other disasters. for example, flooding along the mississippi river can impact eight or more of our properties and result in them being closed for differing periods of time. our properties in florida, mississippi, louisiana and new jersey are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes, wind and storm surge. our pompano property was closed for four days in 2017 because of storms. in addition, severe weather such as high winds and blizzards occasionally limits access to our land-based facilities in colorado and reno. inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured. further, if properties subject to the master lease are impacted by a casualty event, the master lease requires us to repair or restore the affected properties even if the cost of such repair or restoration exceeds the insurance proceeds that we receive. under such circumstances, the rent under the master lease is required to be paid during the period of repair or restoration even if all or a portion of the affected property is not operating. in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. in addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, loss of income due to terrorism, violence, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage and pollution, may not be covered under our policies. any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. further, we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from coverage. among other factors, it is possible that regional political tensions, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits), additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles. among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.
19
we are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure, forces of nature, casualty, extraordinary maintenance and other causes all of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time, as the result of casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, or extended or extraordinary maintenance, among other causes. in addition, our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions. these risks are particularly pronounced at our riverboat and dockside facilities because of their locations on and adjacent to water.
our reliance on our computer systems and software could expose us to great financial harm if any of our computer systems or software were subject to any material disruption or corruption.
we rely significantly on our computer systems and software to receive and properly process internal and external data, including data related to our player loyalty program. a disruption or corruption of the proper functioning of our computer systems or software could cause us to lose data or record erroneous data, which could result in material losses. we cannot guarantee that our efforts to maintain competitive computer systems and software will be successful. our computer systems and software may fail or be subject to bugs or other errors, resulting in service interruptions or other unintended consequences. if any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our business and financial condition from time to time, we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses. in particular, the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business. as with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security we collect information relating to our guests and employees for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states. we rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit this personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information. our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third-party vendors.  we face cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us. cyber-attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, computer malware such as viruses, denial of service, ransomware attacks that encrypt, exfiltrate, or otherwise render data unusable or unavailable in an effort to extort money or other consideration as a condition to purportedly returning the data to a usable form, operator errors or misuse, or inadvertent releases of data, and other forms of electronic security breaches. the steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact, operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.
in addition, third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our guests, suppliers and other business partners. our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner. as a result, our business information, guest, supplier, and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their consent.
20
any such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, guests' or business partners' information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation, businesses, operating results and financial condition.
our operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results, and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future historically, our operations have typically been subject to seasonal variations. our strongest operating results for our reno properties have generally occurred in the second and third quarters and the weakest results have generally occurred during the period from november through february when weather conditions adversely affected operating results. winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to reno, where a significant of our visitors arrive by ground transportation, and certain of our other properties and cause cancellations of live horse racing. for example, the reno-tahoe area experienced exceptionally high levels of snowfall in the first quarter of 2017, with certain resorts in the tahoe area reporting over 50 feet of snowfall during such time, which adversely affected visitation to our reno properties and adversely affected our results of operations for the first quarter of 2017. as a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
the concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us there are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry and a large majority of our revenues are derived from slot machines at our casinos. it is important, for competitive reasons, that we offer the most popular and up-to-date slot machine games with the latest technology to customers.
in recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements. generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long-term than the cost to purchase a new slot machine.
for competitive reasons, we may be forced to acquire new slot machines, slot machine systems or gaming and hotel technology and equipment, or enter into participating lease arrangements, that are more expensive than our costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines, equipment and software. if the newer slot machines, equipment or software do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment, or if we are unable to successfully implement new software or technology, it could adversely affect our operations and profitability.
we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions as part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets, through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities. in the future, we may also pursue expansion opportunities, including joint ventures, in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming.
although we only intend to engage in acquisitions that, if consummated, will be accretive to us and our stockholders, we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or that we will experience the return on investment that we expect. in particular, while we currently anticipate that the acquisitions of tropicana and elgin will be accretive to our earnings per share in 2019, this expectation is based on estimates and assumes certain synergies expected to be realized over a 12-month period following the completion of the acquisitions. such estimates and assumptions could materially change due to factors beyond our control and could delay, decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions and cause resulting dilution to our earnings per share or negatively impact the price of our common stock.
in addition, acquisitions require significant management attention and resources to integrate new properties, businesses and operations. potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include:
•   the inability to successfully incorporate acquired assets in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and other benefits anticipated to result from the acquired operations;

•   complexities associated with managing the combined business, including difficulties addressing possible differences in cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies; and

21
•   potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquired properties.

in addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in:
•   diversion of the attention of our management;

•   the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing businesses; and

•   inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies,

any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations, into our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other problems. additionally, there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for new projects that we may pursue or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved.
we may experience construction delays or cost overruns during our expansion or development projects that could adversely affect our operations from time to time, we may commence development and construction projects on new properties or at our current properties. we also evaluate other expansion opportunities as they become available and may in the future engage in additional construction projects.  as an example, we recently formed a joint venture with cordish to master plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the pompano casino and racetrack.  the anticipated costs and construction periods for development and construction projects are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us or, in the case of pompano, our joint venture partner, in consultation with our architects, all of which are subject to assumptions that may be subject to change based on unforeseen circumstances. development and construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference and unanticipated cost increases. most of these factors are beyond our control. in addition, difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite entitlements, licenses, permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development. significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our results of operations.
our planned capital expenditures may not result in our expected improvements in our business we regularly expend capital to construct, maintain and renovate our properties to remain competitive, maintain the value and brand standards of our properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations. our ability to realize the expected returns on our capital investments is dependent on a number of factors, including, general economic conditions; changes to construction plans and specifications; delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals; disputes with contractors; disruptions to our business caused by construction; and other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.
while we believe that the overall budgets for our planned capital expenditures are reasonable, these costs are estimates and the actual costs may be higher than expected. in addition, we can provide no assurance that these investments will be sufficient or that we will realize our expected returns on our capital investments, or any returns at all. a failure to realize our expected returns on capital investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
22
we may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets, which could negatively affect our operating results as of december 31, 2018, we had $2.4 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. we perform annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of october 1 of each fiscal year, or on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist. for properties with goodwill and/or other intangible assets with indefinite lives, these tests could require the comparison of the implied fair value of each reporting unit to carrying value. in conjunction with the classification of vicksburg's operations as assets held for sale at march 31, 2018 as a result of the announced sale to churchill downs incorporated, an impairment charge totaling $9.8 million was recorded due to the carrying value exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds. the impairment reduced the value of goodwill. additionally, in conjunction with the agreement to sell our rights and obligations to operate nemacolin, an impairment charge totaling $3.8 million was recorded in 2018 due to the carrying value of the property and equipment being sold exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds.
during the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $38.0 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and/or trade names related to our lake charles, lula and vicksburg reporting units.
we must make various assumptions and estimates in performing our impairment testing. our qualitative assessments including assumptions regarding market and industry conditions and our financial performance. our quantitative assessment relies on estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition and by a market approach based upon valuation multiples for similar companies. changes in estimates or market conditions, increases in our cost of capital, reductions in transaction multiples, operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions, could produce significantly different results.
we also evaluate long-lived assets for impairment if indicators of impairment exist. in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of such property, equipment and other long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and residual values.
future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met, we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods. our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory, social and economic climates, recent operating information and budgets, and current operating plans of the various properties where we conduct operations. these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, internal operating decisions, or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties.
risks related to our capital structure and equity ownership our obligations under our indebtedness and master lease are significant as of december 31, 2018, we had $3.3 billion of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of $956.8 million outstanding under our term loan facility (the "term loan facility" or "term loan"), $600 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.0% senior notes due 2026 (the "6% senior notes due 2026"), $875.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.0% senior notes due 2025 (the "6% senior notes due 2025"), $375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2023 (the "7% senior notes due 2023") and $246.0 million of principal outstanding under our loan to fund the purchase of elgin ("lumière loan"). as of december 31, 2018, we had $245.0 outstanding under our $500.0 million revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility" and, together with the term loan, the "credit facility"). in addition, our annual rent payment under the master lease is at least $87.6 million and is subject to annual escalation.  these financial obligations may have important negative consequences for us, including:
•   limiting our ability to satisfy our obligations;

•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;

•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;

•   increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns;

23
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, general corporate or other obligations;

•   subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds, and make capital expenditures and other investments;

•   restricting our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments and other payments;

•   limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on our outstanding debt;

•   exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility;

•   causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us; and

•   affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.

in addition, the master lease requires us to make specific minimum investments in capital expenditures and, subject to certain caps, the rent escalations under the master lease will continue to apply regardless of the cash flows generated by the properties subject to the master lease and the obligations under the master lease are guaranteed by eri.  if the cash flows generated by the leased properties decrease, or do not increase at the same rate as the rent escalations, the rent payable under the master lease and required capital expenditures could constitute a higher percentage of cash flows generated by the leased properties, which could materially exacerbate the consequences described above.
despite our current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness. incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, and may enter into financing obligations similar to the master lease in the future. as of december 31, 2018, we had $242.3 million of borrowing capacity, after consideration of $12.7 million in outstanding letters of credit, under our credit facility. our existing debt agreements currently permit, and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit, us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt. further, we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. the risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and pay rent under the master lease and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful our ability to satisfy our rent obligations under the master lease and make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay rent under the master lease and the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and rent obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and rent obligations. if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service and rent obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. additionally, the agreements governing our existing debt restrict sales of assets and limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition and our master lease limits our ability to dispose of leased properties; as a result, we may not be allowed, under these documents, to dispose of certain of our properties and use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations.
24
the agreements governing our debt and the master lease impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities the agreements governing our existing debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:
•   incur additional debt;

•   create liens or other encumbrances;

•   pay dividends or make other restricted payments;

•   agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;

•   prepay subordinated indebtedness;

•   make investments, loans or other guarantees;

•   sell or otherwise dispose of a portion of our assets; or

•   make acquisitions or merge or consolidate with another entity.

in addition, the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum total leverage ratio covenants.
a failure to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. if our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. moreover, in the event that such indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance it on acceptable terms, or at all.
in addition, our master lease imposes restrictions on the business activities of the tenant, including restrictions on transfers of leased properties, requirements to make minimum specified levels of capital expenditures and limitations on the operation of the leased properties.  the master lease also restricts payments of dividends if the tenant does not meet the specified minimum adjusted revenue to rent ratio.
as a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. the restrictions caused by such covenants could also place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors.
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly the u.s. securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. the market price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. in addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in, or have a material adverse effect on, the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include:
•   general market and economic conditions, including market conditions in the hotel and casino industries;

•   actual or expected variations in operating results;

•   differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;

•   changes in recommendations by securities analysts;

•   operations and stock performance of competitors;

•   accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill;

•   significant acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by competitors;

•   sales of our common stock or other securities in the future, including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors;

•   recruitment or departure of key personnel;

25
•   conditions and trends in the gaming and entertainment industries;

•   changes in the estimate of the future size and growth of our markets; and

•   changes in reserves for professional liability claims.

we cannot assure you that the stock price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. in addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance. if the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, we may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.
we have not historically paid dividends and may not pay dividends in the future we do not currently expect to pay dividends on its common stock. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other factors, our earnings, cash requirements, financial condition, requirements to comply with the covenants under its debt instruments, legal considerations, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. in addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict its ability to pay dividends. if we do not pay dividends, then the return on an investment in its common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price. there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value.

tropicana entertainment inc.
on october 1, 2018, we acquired tropicana in a cash transaction valued at $1.9 billion. at the closing of the transaction tropicana became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. immediately prior to our acquisition, tropicana sold tropicana aruba resort and glp capital, l.p., a wholly owned subsidiary of gaming and leisure properties, inc. ("glpi"), acquired substantially all of tropicana's real estate, other than the real estate underlying montbleu and lumière, for approximately $964 million. we acquired the real estate underlying lumière for $246 million with the proceeds of a $246 million loan from glpi. we funded the remaining consideration payable with our cash on hand and cash on hand at tropicana, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from our offering of $600 million of 6.0% senior notes due 2026. in addition, our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility increased from $300 million to $500 million effective october 1, 2018, and the maturity of the revolving credit facility was extended to october 1, 2023.
substantially concurrently with the acquisition of the real estate portfolio by glpi, we entered into a triple net master lease for the tropicana properties acquired by glpi with an initial term of 15 years, with renewals of up to 20 years at our option ("master lease"). under the master lease, we are required to pay the following, among other things: lease payments to the underlying ground lessor for properties that are subject to ground leases, facility maintenance costs, all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties). the annual rent under the terms of the lease was initially approximately $87.6 million and is subject to annual escalation. we do not have the ability to terminate the obligations under the master lease prior to its expiration without glpi's consent.
lumière loan in connection with the purchase of the real estate related to lumière, glpi, tropicana st. louis re llc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours ("tropicana st. louis re"), and glpi entered into a loan agreement, dated as of october 1, 2018 (the "lumière loan"), relating to a loan of $246 million by glpi to tropicana st. louis re to fund the entire purchase price of the real estate underlying lumière. the lumière loan is guaranteed by us, bears interest at a rate equal to (i) 9.09% until october 1, 2019 and (ii) 9.27% thereafter and matures on october 1, 2020. the lumière loan is secured by a first priority mortgage on the lumière real estate until october 1, 2019. in connection with the issuance of the lumière loan, we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to transfer one or more of elgin, bettendorf, waterloo, lula, vicksburg and mountaineer or such other property or properties mutually acceptable to tropicana st. louis re and glpi, provided that the aggregate value of such property, individually or collectively, is at least $246 million (the "replacement property"), to glpi with a simultaneous leaseback to us of such replacement property.  in connection with such replacement property sale, (i) we and glpi will enter into an amendment to the master lease to revise the economic terms to include the replacement property, (ii) glpi, or one of its affiliates, will assume the lumière loan and tropicana st. louis re's obligations under the
35
lumière loan in consideration of the acquisition of the replacement property and our tropicana st. louis re's obligations under the lumière loan will be deemed to have been satisfied, (iii) the lumière real property will be released from the lien placed on it in connection with the lumière loan (if such lien has not yet been released in accordance with the terms of the lumière loan) and (iv) in the event the value of the replacement property is greater than the outstanding obligations of tropicana st. louis re under the lumière loan, glpi will pay tropicana st. louis re the difference between the value of the replacement property and the amount of outstanding obligations under the lumière loan. if such replacement property transaction is not consummated prior to the maturity date of the lumière loan, other than as a result of certain failures to perform by glpi, then the amounts outstanding will be paid in full and the rent under the master lease will automatically increase, subject to certain escalations.

dispositions on february 28, 2018, we entered into definitive agreements to sell substantially all of the assets and liabilities of presque isle downs and vicksburg to churchill downs incorporated ("cdi"). under the terms of the agreements, cdi agreed to purchase presque isle downs for cash consideration of approximately $178.9 million and vicksburg for cash consideration of approximately $50.6 million, in each case subject to a customary working capital adjustment. in conjunction with the classification of vicksburg's operations as assets held for sale at march 31, 2018 as a result of the announced sale to cdi, an impairment charge totaling $9.8 million was recorded due to the carrying value exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds.
36
the definitive agreements provided that the dispositions were subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals, termination of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino act and other customary closing conditions, including, in the case of presque isle downs, the prior closing of the sale of vicksburg or the entry into an agreement to acquire another asset of ours. on may 7, 2018, we and cdi each received a request for additional information and documentary materials, often referred to as a "second request," from the federal trade commission in connection with its review of the vicksburg acquisition.
on july 6, 2018, in consideration of the time and expense needed to reply to the second request, the company and cdi entered into a termination agreement and release pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the asset purchase agreement with respect to vicksburg and to enter into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which cdi would acquire and assume the rights and obligations to operate nemacolin (the "vicksburg termination agreement"). the vicksburg termination agreement also provided that cdi would pay us a $5.0 million termination fee upon execution of a definitive agreement with respect to the nemacolin transaction.  on august 10, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the assets and liabilities of nemacolin to cdi.  under the terms of the agreement, cdi agreed to purchase nemacolin for cash consideration of approximately $0.1 million, subject to a customary working capital adjustment.
as a result of the agreement to sell nemacolin, an impairment charge of $3.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 was recorded due to the carrying value of the net property and equipment being sold exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds.
we closed on the sale of presque isle downs on january 11, 2019. we expect to close on the sale of nemacolin in the first quarter of 2019, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, including receipt of pennsylvania regulatory approvals.
reportable segments the executive decision maker of our company reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a "significant market" basis. our management views each of its properties as an operating segment. operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, the regulatory environments in which they operate, and their management and reporting structure. prior to our acquisition of isle, our principal operating activities occurred in three geographic regions: nevada, louisiana and parts of the eastern united states. following the isle acquisition, the company's principal operating activities occurred in four geographic regions and reportable segments: west, midwest, south and east. following the tropicana acquisition and elgin acquisition, an additional segment, central, was added increasing our reportable segments to five.
presentation of financial information the financial information included in this item 7 for periods prior to our acquisitions of isle, elgin, and tropicana are those of eri and its subsidiaries. the presentation of information herein for periods prior to our acquisitions of isle, elgin and tropicana and after our acquisition of isle, elgin and tropicana are not fully comparable because the results of operations for isle, elgin and tropicana are not included for periods prior to their respective acquisition dates.

key performance metrics our primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, but we use our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers visiting and staying at our properties. key performance metrics include volume indicators such as table games drop and slot handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. the amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. in addition, hotel occupancy and price per room designated by average daily rate ("adr") are key indicators for our hotel business. our calculation of adr consists of the average price of occupied rooms per day including the impact of resort fees and complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy.

significant factors impacting financial results the following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
•   isle acquisition - our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 include incremental revenues and expenses attributable to the 13 properties we acquired in our acquisition of isle on may 1, 2017. transaction (credits) expenses related to our acquisition of isle for legal, accounting, financial advisory services, severance, stock awards and other costs totaled $(1.4) million for the year ended december 31, 2018 and $92.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.

•   elgin acquisition - our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 include incremental revenues and expenses for the period of august 7, 2018 through december 31, 2018 attributable to elgin. transaction expenses related to our acquisition of elgin totaled $3.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.

•   tropicana acquisition - our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 include incremental revenues and expenses attributable to the seven properties we acquired in our acquisition of tropicana on october 1, 2018. transaction expenses related to our acquisition of tropicana totaled $18.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.

•   master lease - we accounted for the master lease with glpi as a direct financing obligation effective october 1, 2018. as a result, we recorded minimum lease payments and amortization of the direct financing obligation totaling $24.4 million as interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2018.

•   lake charles terminated sale - on august 22, 2016, isle entered into an agreement to sell its casino and hotel property in lake charles, louisiana, for $134.5 million, subject to a customary purchase price adjustment, to an affiliate of laguna development corporation, a pueblo of laguna-owned business based in albuquerque, new mexico. on november 21, 2017, we terminated the agreement. the closing of the transaction was subject to certain closing conditions, including obtaining certain gaming approvals, and was to occur on or before the termination date, which had been extended by the parties to november 20, 2017. the buyer did not obtain the required gaming approvals prior to the termination date, and pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the $20.0 million deposit was forfeited upon termination of the agreement and recorded as operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017.

in periods prior to the termination of the agreement, the operations of lake charles were classified as discontinued operations and as an asset held for sale. as a result of the termination of the sale in the fourth quarter of 2017, lake charles was no longer classified as an asset held for sale and as discontinued operations.
•   dispositions - the sales of presque isle downs and nemacolin met the requirements for presentation as assets held for sale under generally accepted accounting principles. however, they did not meet the requirements for presentation as discontinued operations and are included in income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2018.

in conjunction with the classification of vicksburg's operations as assets held for sale at march 31, 2018 as a result of the announced sale to cdi, an impairment charge totaling $9.8 million was recorded due to the carrying value exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds. effective july 6, 2018, the sale of vicksburg was terminated, and vicksburg was no longer presented as an asset held for sale as of september 30, 2018. in connection with this termination, cdi paid us a $5.0 million termination fee, which is included in operating income for the year ended december 31, 2018.
on august 10, 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our rights and obligations to operate nemacolin. due to the carrying value of the property and equipment being sold exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds, we recorded an impairment charge for the year ended december 31, 2018 totaling $3.8 million related to nemacolin.
the sale of presque isle downs closed on january 11, 2019 and the sale of nemacolin is expected to close in in the first quarter of 2019.
•   isle debt refinancing - in connection with the isle acquisition, we completed a debt financing transaction comprised of: (i) a senior secured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion with a term loan facility of $1.45 billion and revolving credit facility of $300.0 million and (ii) $375.0 million of 6.0% senior notes due 2025. the proceeds of such borrowings were used to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable in the isle merger, refinance all of isle's existing credit facilities, redeem or otherwise repurchase all of isle's senior and senior subordinated notes, refinance our existing credit facility and pay transaction fees and expenses related to the foregoing. we recognized a loss totaling $27.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as a result of the isle debt refinancing transaction (see "liquidity and capital resources" for more information related to the debt refinancing).

39
•   add-on notes - on september 13, 2017, we issued an additional $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due 2025 at an issue price equal to 105.5% of the principal amount. we used the proceeds of the offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaling $78.0 million and used the remainder to repay outstanding borrowings totaling $444.5 million under the term loan plus related accrued interest. we recognized a loss of $11.1 million as a result of the issuance of additional debt and retirement of existing debt for the year ended december 31, 2017.

•   tropicana financing - on september 20, 2018, we issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due 2026. the proceeds from the notes were used to fund the tropicana acquisition which closed on october 1, 2018. we incurred $10.1 million of incremental interest expense on these notes for the year ended december 31, 2018.

•   tax cuts and jobs act - on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act made broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, including, but not limited to, reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act, for certain of our net deferred tax liabilities, we recorded a decrease of $111.9 million, net of the related change in valuation allowance, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax benefit for the year ending december 31, 2017 as a result of the corporate rate reduction resulting in a positive impact on net income.

•   impairment charges - on october 1, 2017 we conducted annual impairment tests of our intangible assets. based on lower than expected operating performance and projected future operating results, it was determined that the value of goodwill and/or trade names associated with our lake charles, vicksburg and lula reporting units were impaired resulting in impairment charges totaling $38.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.

•   severe weather - during the third quarter of 2017, hurricanes harvey and irma negatively impacted our south region, specifically our pompano, lake charles and eldorado shreveport properties, and made travel to those properties impossible or difficult. while pompano did not sustain any major physical damage, we incurred incremental expenses as a result of the storms and were forced to close the casino for four days and experienced disruption to our business for a longer period of time.

our west segment's operations are subject to seasonal variation, with our lowest business volume generally occurring during the winter months. the northern nevada region experienced record snowfall and severe weather conditions, including major snow storms during eleven of the fourteen weekends in the 2017 first quarter, making travel to reno from northern california, our main feeder market, difficult or impossible due to road closures. as a result, there was a significant adverse effect on business levels, especially hotel occupancy and gaming volume, during the first quarter of 2017, and our operating performance for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016.
•   execution of synergies and cost savings programs - we continue to identify areas to improve property level and consolidated margins through operating and cost efficiencies and exercising financial discipline throughout the company without impacting the guest experience. in addition to cost savings relating to duplicative executive compensation, legal and accounting fees and other corporate expenses that have been eliminated as a result of our acquisitions, we have achieved savings in marketing, food and beverage costs, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other operating departments as a result of operating efficiencies and purchasing power of the combined eldorado organization.

•   property enhancement capital expenditures - property enhancement initiatives and targeted investments that improve our guests' experiences and elevate our properties' overall competitiveness in their markets continued throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018.

as part of the continuing evolution of the reno tri-properties, we built a new 21,000 square foot spa at silver legacy which opened in early october 2018. we have substantially renovated every room at circus reno and will start the first phase of renovations of 400 rooms at silver legacy and 42 high-end suites at eldorado in the second half of 2019. in black hawk we expect to renovate all 402 hotel rooms during the first half of 2019. in addition, our joint venture with cordish continues making progress on development plans of a new world-class, mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination anchored by our isle casino racing pompano park.
a 118-room hampton inn hotel at scioto downs developed by a third party opened in march 2017 and since opening has driven visitation and spend at the property.
•   new regulation - effective january 1, 2016, the ohio lottery commission enacted new regulation which resulted in the establishment of a $1.0 million progressive slot liability and a corresponding decrease in net slot win for the year ended december 31, 2016. the changes are non-cash and related to jackpots established in prior years. the net non-cash impact to scioto down's gaming revenues and operating income was $1.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively for the year ended december 31, 2016.

operating results.  including incremental isle, elgin and tropicana net revenues totaling $575.5 million generated following their respective acquisition dates, net revenues increased 38.8% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017. excluding incremental isle, elgin and tropicana net revenues, net revenues remained flat for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017.
isle contributed $600.1 million of incremental net revenues from the date we acquired isle on may 1, 2017 through december 31, 2017 consisting primarily of gaming revenues. including these incremental net revenues, net revenues increased 64.4% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. excluding these incremental net revenues, net revenues declined 2.2% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to decreased revenues associated with severe weather during the first and third quarters of 2017.
for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017, operating income increased 227.1% mainly due to incremental operating income contributed by isle, elgin and tropicana following their respective acquisition dates. incremental operating income totaling $80.7 million represents operating income for four months of operations for isle, five months of operations for elgin and three months of operations for tropicana. excluding the incremental operating income, operating income rose 141.9% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017 due to margin improvement resulting from synergies and departmental operating efficiencies, a $34.2 million decrease in impairment charges and a $71.9 million decline in transaction expenses. these increases in operating income for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017 were partially offset by higher depreciation associated with additional assets.
operating income increased 6.9% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. this increase was primarily due to $82.3 million of incremental operating income contributed by isle for the year ended december 31, 2017 and a $20.0 million deposit recorded as operating income in conjunction with the termination of the sale our lake charles property. these increases were partially offset by the $83.6 million increase in transaction expenses associated with our acquisition of isle and the $38.0 million impairment charge recorded in 2017 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and/or trade names related to our lake charles, lula and vicksburg reporting units.
for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017, net income increased 29.8% due to the same factors impacting operating income combined with the $38.4 million loss on the early retirement of debt for the year ended december 31, 2017 associated with our refinancing completed in may 2017. these increases were partially offset by higher interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017 resulting from increased debt and amortization of the direct financing obligation associated with the master lease following our acquisitions. additionally, the increase in our tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2017 due to the favorable impact of the tax act in 2017 also partially offset the increases in net income.
net income increased 199.2% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the $111.9 million net adjustment to our deferred income tax benefit for the year ending december 31, 2017 as a result of the corporate tax rate reduction due to the tax act, combined with the other factors impacting operating income. this increase was partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from the issuance of new debt and the loss on the early retirement of debt recorded in 2017.

gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions.  isle contributed $504.2 million of gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 83.2% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016.

excluding incremental isle gaming revenues and pari-mutuel commissions of $504.2 million, gaming revenues declined 0.9% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in gaming revenues across all segments. the decline in the west segment was mainly attributable to decreases in visitor traffic due to severe weather the northern nevada region experienced throughout the first quarter of 2017 that resulted in limited access from our main feeder markets combined with the absence of a major bowling tournament in the reno market. additionally, reductions in gaming volume driven by decreased high-end play, the continued weakness in the energy sector and historically lower table games hold percentage impacted the shreveport market and severe weather in the third quarter of 2017 negatively impacted the south segment in 2017. efforts to eliminate unprofitable gaming play via reductions in marketing promotions and incentives across the properties also contributed to the declines in casino volume and positively impacted margins across all segments.
non-gaming revenues.  isle contributed $96.0 million of non-gaming revenues for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 27.1% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle non-gaming revenues of $96.0 million, non-gaming revenues decreased 4.9% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. the west segment declined for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 principally due to lower hotel, food and beverage revenues resulting from reduced customer traffic due to fewer convention room nights, severe weather in the northern nevada region throughout the first quarter of 2017 and the absence of a major bowling tournament during 2017. the south segment decrease in non-gaming revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to decreased food and beverage revenues associated with revisions to marketing strategies resulting in fewer complimentary food offers and severe weather negatively impacting visitation in 2017. non-gaming revenues in the east segment decreased for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreased food and beverage revenues resulting from reductions in complimentary food offers and the consolidation of restaurants in an effort to maximize capacity utilization.
gaming expenses and pari-mutuel commissions.  isle contributed $228.2 million of gaming expenses and pari-mutuel commissions for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 59.3% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle gaming expenses and pari-mutuel commissions, gaming expenses and pari-mutuel commissions decreased 5.5% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases in gaming volume combined with savings initiatives targeted at reducing variable expenses along with continued synergies related to the integration of the reno properties in the west segment. additionally, successful efforts to control costs and maximize departmental profit across all segments also drove the decline in expenses during the current period.
non-gaming expenses. isle contributed $71.4 million of non-gaming expenses for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 29.8% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle non-gaming expenses, non-gaming expenses decreased 6.9% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 in conjunction with non-gaming revenue declines and successful efforts to control costs and maximize profit across all segments.
marketing and promotions expenses.  isle contributed $36.4 million of marketing and promotions expense for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 103.4% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle marketing and promotions expenses, consolidated marketing and promotions expense increased 14.4% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. this increase was primarily attributable to marketing promotional costs associated with casino initiatives that are charged to this category to provide consistency among properties following our acquisition of isle.
general and administrative expenses.  isle contributed $113.6 million of general and administrative expense for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 84.4% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle general and administrative expenses, consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased 2.5% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. savings associated with lower property and general liability insurance costs were partially offset by higher expenses associated with information systems maintenance contracts and professional services. these incremental costs resulted from information technology infrastructure projects targeted at consolidating systems for future savings and efficiencies.
45
corporate expenses.  for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016, corporate expenses increased due to payroll and other expenses associated with additional corporate expenses driven by growth related to the isle acquisition. also, the increase was the result of higher stock compensation expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 due to the three-year vesting schedule associated with our long-term incentive plan established in 2015 resulting in three years of grants and related expense in 2017 versus two years of grants and related expense in 2016.
impairment charges. on october 1, 2017 we conducted annual impairment tests of our intangible assets. based on less than expected operating performance and projected future operating results, it was determined that the value of goodwill and/or trade names associated with our lake charles, vicksburg and lula reporting units were impaired resulting in impairment charges totaling $38.0 million ($34.9 million related to goodwill and $3.1 million related to trade names) recorded in the current year.
depreciation and amortization expense.  isle contributed $47.1 million of depreciation expense for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31, 2017 resulting in an increase of 66.9% over 2016.
excluding incremental isle depreciation and amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense decreased 7.3% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 mainly due to lower depreciation in all segments due to assets becoming fully depreciated.
supplemental unaudited presentation of consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017
adjusted ebitda (defined below), a non-gaap financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non-gaap supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the company's ongoing operating results. management has historically used adjusted ebitda when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. adjusted ebitda represents operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, transaction expenses, severance expense, selling costs associated with the disposition of properties, proceeds from the terminated sales of vicksburg and lake charles, preopening expenses, business interruption insurance proceeds, real estate tax settlements, other than temporary impairments on investments, impairment charges, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property and equipment, and other non-cash regulatory gaming assessments. adjusted ebitda also excludes expense associated with our master lease with glpi as the transaction was accounted for as a financing obligation. adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("us gaap"), is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. uses of cash flows that are not reflected in adjusted ebitda include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. as a result, adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. other companies that provide ebitda information may calculate ebitda differently than we do. the definition of adjusted ebitda may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.

liquidity and capital resources we are a holding company and our only significant assets are ownership interests in our subsidiaries. our ability to fund our obligations depends on the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise make funds available to us.
our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been existing cash, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and proceeds from our recent disposition of presque isle.
our cash requirements can fluctuate significantly depending on our decisions with respect to business acquisitions or dispositions and strategic capital investments to maintain the quality of our properties. we expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the operation and maintenance of our properties, taxes, servicing our outstanding indebtedness, rent payments under our master lease and continued costs associated with the recent elgin and tropicana acquisitions. during 2019, we plan to spend approximately $200.0 million on capital expenditures including capital expenditures for the properties purchased in the elgin and tropicana acquisitions. our capital requirements have increased significantly following the consummation of the acquisitions of tropicana and elgin, the related obligation to pay annual rent in an initial amount of approximately $87.6 million under the master lease with respect to certain of the tropicana properties and the required payments under the lumière note.
48
we funded the $328.8 million of cash consideration for the elgin acquisition using cash from ongoing operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we funded the $246 million purchase of the real estate underlying lumière with the proceeds of the lumière note. we funded the $640 million consideration in the tropicana acquisition and the repayment of amounts outstanding under the tropicana credit facility with our cash on hand and cash on hand at tropicana, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from our offering of $600 million of 6.0% senior notes due 2026. in addition, our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility increased from $300 million to $500 million effective substantially concurrently with the consummation of the tropicana acquisition on october 1, 2018 and we extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility to october 1, 2023. we expect that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements, and service our outstanding indebtedness for the next twelve months.
at december 31, 2018, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $230.8 million, excluding restricted cash. at december 31, 2017, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $134.6 million, excluding restricted cash. this increase in cash was primarily due to cash acquired in the elgin and tropicana acquisitions.
operating cash flow.  in 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $323.3 million compared to $129.9 million in 2017. the increase in operating cash was primarily due to incremental operating cash generated by the acquired elgin and tropicana properties and decreased transaction costs combined with changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business.
in 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $129.9 million compared to $95.4 million in 2016. the increase in operating cash was primarily due to incremental operating cash generated by the acquired isle properties offset by transaction expenses associated with our acquisition of isle combined with changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business.
investing cash flow and capital expenditures.  net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1.3 billion in 2018 compared to $1.4 billion in 2017. net cash flows used in investing activities in 2018 were primarily due to $307.3 million cash paid in the elgin acquisition and $806.0 million cash paid in the tropicana acquisition. additionally, capital expenditures totaled $147.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 related to growth and maintenance capital projects.
net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2017 compared to $41.8 million in 2016. net cash flows used in investing activities in 2017 were primarily due to cash paid to acquire isle in addition to $83.1 million in capital expenditures for various property enhancement and maintenance projects and equipment purchases.
financing cash flow.  net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 totaled $1.1 billion and was principally due to $600.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the 6.0% senior notes due 2026 in conjunction with the tropicana acquisition, $246.0 million of proceeds from the lumière loan (defined below) and $245.0 million of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility related to the elgin acquisition.
net cash used for financing activities in 2017 totaled $1.4 billion and consisted mainly of the issuance of debt associated with our acquisition of isle, the refinancing of our term loan and revolving credit facility in may 2017 and the issuance of additional 6.0% senior notes due 2025 in september 2017. this increase was partially offset by net payments made on our credit facilities throughout 2017 and taxes paid related to net share settlements of equity awards associated with the isle transaction.
income taxes.  the company will pay approximately $45 million in cash taxes in 2019 as a result of the tropicana acquisition.  in addition, the company expects to be a cash taxpayer in 2019 due to the complete utilization of its net operating losses and tax credit carryovers for federal income tax purposes.

(2)   estimated interest payments on long-term debt are based on libor rates and principal amounts outstanding on the credit facility at december 31, 2018.

(3)   our operating lease obligations are described in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.

(4)   includes an annual table gaming license fee of $2.5 million for mountaineer which is due on july 1st of each year for as long as mountaineer operates table games. includes our obligation for gaming taxes at presque isle downs, which is set at a minimum of $10.0 million per year, as required by the pennsylvania gaming control board. also includes our obligation at presque isle downs, as the holder of a category 1 license, to create a fund to be used for the improvement and maintenance of the backside area of the racetrack with an amount of not less than $250,000 or more than $1 million annually for a five-year period beginning in 2017. we sold presque isle downs in january 2019.

(5)   includes any construction or other contracts which are not operating or capital leases.

(6)   pursuant to an agreement with the mountaineer park horsemen's benevolent and protective association, inc. and/or in accordance with the west virginia racing statute, mountaineer is required to utilize its best efforts to conduct racing for a minimum of 210 days and pay average daily minimum purses established by mountaineer prior to the first live racing date each year ($85,000 for 2019) for the term of the agreement, which expires on december 31, 2019.

(7)   in connection with the 2003 purchase of scioto downs, certain stockholders of scioto downs elected the option to receive cash and contingent earn‐out payments ("cep rights") in lieu of all cash for their outstanding shares of scioto downs' common stock. the triggering event occurred when scioto downs received its permanent vlt license in may 2012 and commenced gaming operations. as a result, we recorded a liability for the estimated ten-year payout to the stockholders who elected to receive the cep rights. the future obligation was calculated based on scioto downs' projected ebitda for the ten calendar years beginning january 1, 2013.

(8)   these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheets, which are included elsewhere in this report. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our regulatory gaming assessments.

(9)   the master lease annual estimated payments consist of building base rent totaling $60.9 million, land base rent totaling $13.4 million and variable rent totaling $13.4 million. the building base rent includes an annual 2% escalation.

the table above excludes certain commitments as of december 31, 2018, for which the timing of expenditures associated with such commitments is unknown, or contractual agreements have not been executed, or the guaranteed maximum price for such contractual agreements has not been agreed upon.
the repayment of our long‐term debt, which consists of indebtedness evidenced by the 6% senior notes due 2025, 6% senior notes due 2026, 7% senior notes due 2023 and the credit facility, is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing these obligations.
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business, including construction contracts for minor projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole. our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts.
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues, results of operations or cash flows since inception.
other liquidity matters we are faced with certain contingencies involving litigation and environmental remediation and compliance. these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in "part i, item 3. legal proceedings" and note 17 to our consolidated financial statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this report. in addition, new competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity. see "part i, item 1a. risk factors-risks related to our business" which is included elsewhere in this report.
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this report. these policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in
55
their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates.
business combinations we applied the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805, "business combinations," in the accounting for our acquisitions of isle, elgin, tropicana and our previous acquisitions. it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of their respective acquisition dates were measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including our estimate of intangible assets, such as gaming licenses, trade names and loyalty programs. although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain. for our gaming license valuation, our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations. cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits and growth percentages. the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition. the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses, respectively.
casino revenue and pari-mutuel commissions the company recognizes net win from gaming activities as casino revenue, which is the difference between gaming wins and losses, not the total amount wagered. progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established. gaming revenues are recognized net of certain cash and free play incentives. pari-mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks and are recognized at the time wagers are made. such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies, as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations. the company recognizes revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made and recorded on a gross basis. such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks.
non-gaming revenue hotel, food and beverage, and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed. the revenue for hotel, food and beverage contracts is the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services. hotel, food and beverage services have been determined to be separate, stand-alone performance obligations and the transaction price for such contracts is recorded as revenue as the good or service is transferred to the customer over the customer's stay at the hotel or when the delivery is made for the food and beverage. advance deposits for future hotel occupancy, convention space or food and beverage services contracts are recorded as deferred income until the revenue recognition criteria has been met. the company also provides goods and services that may include multiple performance obligations, such as for packages, for which revenues are allocated on a pro rata basis based on each service's stand-alone selling price.
complimentaries the company offers discretionary coupons and other discretionary complimentaries to customers outside of the loyalty program. the retail value of complimentary food, beverage, hotel rooms and other services provided to customers is recognized as a reduction to the revenues for the department which issued the complimentary and a credit to the revenue for the department redeemed. complimentaries provided by third parties at the discretion and under the control of the company is recorded as an expense when incurred.
for information with respect to our adoption of asu no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers," (topic 606) effective january 1, 2018, see "note 2, summary of significant accounting policies - recently issued accounting pronouncements", in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
56
income taxes we and our subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns. our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities. see note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.
we record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the "more likely than not" realization threshold. this assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. management must analyze all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income.
under the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more‐likely‐than‐not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the accounting standards also provide guidance on de‐recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31, 2018 and 2017.
property and equipment and other long‐lived assets property and equipment are recorded at cost, except for assets acquired in our business combinations, which were adjusted for fair value under asc 805 and are depreciated over their remaining estimated useful life or lease term. judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets. the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets. we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur, more experience is acquired, and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates.
property, equipment and other long‐lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360, property, plant, and equipment. we evaluate our long‐lived assets periodically for impairment issues or, more frequently, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. the amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). for assets to be disposed of, impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. as a result of the agreement to sell nemacolin, an impairment charge of $3.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 was recorded to property and equipment due to the carrying value of net property and equipment being sold exceeding net sales proceeds. based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any long-lived assets impairment charges during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016.
for undeveloped properties, including non‐operating real properties, when indicators of impairment are present, properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset's carrying amount. the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons. the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations, which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed, were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace, which fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
57
goodwill and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. as a result of our annual impairment tests, none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2018 and 2016. for our 2017 annual goodwill impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for each of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units were less than their carrying values. we then utilized the two-step quantitative analysis for these reporting units. as a result of the two-step quantitative analysis performed in 2017, we recorded impairment charges of $34.9 million and $3.1 million related to goodwill and trade names, respectively. in conjunction with the classification of vicksburg's operations as assets held for sale at march 31, 2018, an impairment charge totaling $9.8 million to goodwill was recorded.
our indefinite‐lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses and trade names and are evaluated for impairment annually by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statements of income in the period of review.
the gaming and racing licenses were valued in aggregate for each respective property, as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses. therefore, a market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate. the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology, which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property, including working capital, fixed assets, and other intangible assets. we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties, the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it's the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets. under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties, licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility. because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility, the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property.
we value trade names using the relief‐from‐royalty method with royalty rates range from 0.5% ‐ 1.0%. trade names recorded as part of the merger with mtr are amortized on a straight‐line basis over a 3.5-year useful life and the trade names recorded as part of our acquisition of tropicana, elgin, isle and acquisition of the reno properties are not amortized (deemed indefinite-lived).
the loyalty programs were valued using a combination of a replacement cost and lost profits analysis and the loyalty programs are amortized on a straight‐line basis over a one- to five-year useful life.
assessing goodwill and indefinite‐lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative business‐specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments. our properties' estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses. unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge, which could be material. cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits, growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state, or local regulations, economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties. the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends, the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition.
we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and other indefinite‐lived intangible assets; however, these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet, we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges, which may be material, in future periods.
58
self‐insurance reserves we are self‐insured for various levels of general liability, employee medical insurance coverage and workers' compensation coverage. insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. we utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities. while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments, in managements' opinion, recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments. self-insurance reserves for employee medical claims and workers' compensations are included in accrued payroll and related on the consolidated balance sheets. self‐insurance reserves for general liability claims are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
player loyalty program we offer programs at our properties whereby participating customers can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines, lodging, food and beverage, merchandise and, in limited situations, cash. the incentives earned by customers under these programs are based on previous revenue transactions and represent separate performance obligations. points earned, less estimated breakage, are recorded as a reduction of casino revenues at the standalone selling price of the points when earned based upon the retail value of the benefits, historical redemption rates and estimated breakage and recognized as departmental revenue based on where such points are redeemed upon fulfillment of the performance obligation. the loyalty program liability represents a deferral of revenue until redemption occurs, which is typically less than one year.
litigation, claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. if our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. actual results could differ from these estimates.

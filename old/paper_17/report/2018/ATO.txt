item 1a.   risk factors.
our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors, many of which are not within our control. although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below, please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future. investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report. these factors include the following:
we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results.
we are subject to regulatory oversight from various state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve. therefore, our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other third-party intervenors. in the normal course of business, as a regulated entity, we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed. further, the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking. because of this process, we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly referred to as "regulatory lag."
however, in the last several years, a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service. these mechanisms work to effectively reduce the regulatory lag
13
inherent in the ratemaking process. however, regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms. the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may (i) review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or (ii) limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers.
we are also subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the clean-up of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to employee health and safety. environmental legislation also requires that our facilities, sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results. in addition, existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations.
some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results.
ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations, including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc's other rules, policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. these rules carry increased penalties for violations. although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations, changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or financial results.
we may experience increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations.
the safety and protection of the public, our customers and our employees is our top priority. we constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely, reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 75,000 miles of distribution and transmission lines. however, in recent years, natural gas distribution and pipeline companies have faced increasing federal, state and local oversight of the safety of their operations. although we believe these costs should be ultimately recoverable through our rates, the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results.
distributing, transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs.
our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of our distribution system. while atmos energy, with the support from each of its regulatory commissions, is accelerating the replacement of aging pipeline infrastructure, operating issues such as as leaks, accidents, equipment problems and incidents, including explosions and fire, could result in legal liability, repair and remediation costs, increased operating costs, significant increased capital expenditures, regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence. we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks. however, because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas, any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large. if these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance, which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected.
our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business, which requires extensive capital spending.
our operations are capital-intensive. we must make significant capital expenditures on a long-term basis to modernize our distribution and transmission system to improve the safety and reliability and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate. in addition, we must continually build new capacity to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve. the magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors, including new regulations, the general state of the economy and weather.
the liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing. the cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets, interest rates and other market conditions. this in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure.
the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy.
our long-term debt is currently rated as "investment grade" by standard & poor's corporation and moody's investors service, inc. similar to most companies, we rely upon access to both short-term and long-term credit and capital markets to
14
satisfy our liquidity requirements. if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private credit and public capital markets, we could see a reduction in our liquidity. a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the credit rating agencies. such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit and/or public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing.
while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future, especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term. the future effects on our business, liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us, both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate.
we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control, which could adversely affect our financial results.
we are subject to market risks beyond our control, including (i) commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics, counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness, and (ii) interest rate risk. we are generally insulated from commodity price risk through our purchased gas cost mechanisms. with respect to interest rate risk, we have been operating in a relatively low interest-rate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and long-term interest rates. however, increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results to the extent that we do not recover our actual interest expense in our rates.
the concentration of our operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions, weather patterns and regulatory decisions in texas.
approximately 70 percent of our consolidated operations are located in the state of texas. this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general, weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas.
a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results.
any adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states, especially in the states in which we operate, could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households. as a result, our customers could seek to use less gas and it may be more difficult for them to pay their gas bills. this would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable. this, in turn, could increase our financing requirements. additionally, should economic conditions deteriorate, our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources, which could result in lower sales volumes.
increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness.
rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in short-term debt. we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered. increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher than normal accounts receivable. this could result in higher short-term debt levels, greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.
if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner, our ability to meet our customers' natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected.
in order to meet our customers' annual and seasonal natural gas demands, we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas, interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity. if we are unable to obtain these, either from our suppliers' inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. if a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines' transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions, legislative or regulatory actions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, terrorist or cyber-attacks or acts of war, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected.
our operations are subject to increased competition.
in residential and commercial customer markets, our distribution operations compete with other energy products, such as electricity and propane. our primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. this could adversely impact our business if our customer growth slows or if our customers further conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings.
15
in the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic conditions, including higher gas costs, could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy, such as electricity, or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per-unit costs. our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. however, in the last few years, several new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business.
adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results.
we have weather-normalized rates for approximately 97 percent of our residential and commercial meters in our distribution operations, which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmer-than-normal weather for meters in those service areas. however, there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future. the loss of such weather-normalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. in addition, our operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season. additionally, sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our operations.
the costs of providing health care benefits, pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially.
we provide health care benefits, a cash-balance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible full-time employees. the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation, and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits. the impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the company is difficult to measure at this time.
the costs of providing a cash-balance pension plan to eligible full-time employees prior to 2011 and postretirement health care benefits to eligible full-time employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans. any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future. further, our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors, including (i) changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years; (ii) various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, and higher or lower withdrawal rates; and (iii) future government regulation.
the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future, should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely affect our financial results.
the inability to continue to hire, train and retain operational, technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.
although the average age of the employee base of atmos energy is not significantly changing year over year, there are still a number of employees who will become eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years. if we were unable to hire appropriate personnel or contractors to fill future needs, the company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs, primarily due to a loss of knowledge, errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel. in addition, higher costs could result from loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues. the inability to hire, train and retain new operational, technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. if we were unable to hire, train and retain appropriately qualified personnel, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
the operations and financial results of the company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate change or related additional legislation or regulation in the future.
to the extent climate change occurs, our businesses could be adversely impacted, although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. to the extent climate change would result in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues. such climate change could also cause shifts in population, including customers moving away from our service territories near the gulf coast in louisiana and mississippi.
another possible climate change would be more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers. if we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers, our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally would have to
16
seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. to the extent we would be unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services, our future business, financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted.
in addition, there have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. the adoption of this type of legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business, affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers. at this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our future business, financial condition or financial results.
cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or company information.
our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems, even though the company has implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities. we use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline and storage operations and other business processes. disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers, operate our pipeline and storage systems or serve our customers timely. accordingly, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
in addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer, employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business. any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability. even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyber-related risks, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage.
natural disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results.
natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations. in addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. also, companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations to increased risks. as a result, the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited, which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction this section provides management's discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. it includes management's interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans. this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in item 1a above, "risk factors". they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements.
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995
the statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. when used in this report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect", "forecast", "goal", "intend", "objective", "plan", "projection", "seek", "strategy" or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply and other factors. these risks and uncertainties include the following: state and local regulatory trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; possible increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations; the inherent hazards and risks involved in distributing, transporting and storing natural gas; the capital-intensive nature of our business; our ability to continue to access the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities, including commodity price volatility, counterparty performance or creditworthiness and interest rate risk; the concentration of our operations in texas; the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers; changes in the availability and price of natural gas; the availability and accessibility of contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services; increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; adverse weather conditions; increased costs of providing health care benefits, along with pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements; the inability to continue to hire, train and retain operational, technical and managerial personnel; the impact of climate change or related additional legislation or regulation in the future; the threat of cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or company information; natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from estimates.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in notes 2 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. accordingly, these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors.

postretirement plans   pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a september 30 measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. the assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                             general economic and market conditions the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs. when establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year and the

expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs. we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year's annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected. rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years.   assumed future salary increases the market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. the use of this methodology will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period.

non-gaap financial measures our operations are affected by the cost of natural gas, which is passed through to our customers without markup and includes commodity price, transportation, storage, injection and withdrawal fees and settlements of financial instruments used to mitigate commodity price risk. these costs are reflected in the income statement as purchased gas cost. therefore, increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. accordingly, we believe contribution margin, a non-gaap financial measure, defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost, is a more useful and relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than operating revenues. as such, the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference contribution margin rather than operating revenues and purchased gas cost individually. further, the term contribution margin is not intended to represent operating income, the most comparable gaap financial measure, as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
as described further in note 12, the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tcja") required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities at our new federal statutory income tax rate as of december 22, 2017. the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities resulted in the recognition of a non-cash income tax benefit of $158.8 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018. due to the non-recurring nature of this benefit, we believe that income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before the non-cash income tax benefit provide a more relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than income from continuing operations and consolidated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in order to allow investors to better analyze our core results and allow the information to be presented on a comparative basis to the prior year. accordingly, the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference adjusted income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share, which is calculated as follows:

results of operations overview atmos energy strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value. our commitment to modernizing our natural gas distribution and transmission systems requires a significant level of capital spending. we have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of these investments timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns. the execution of our capital spending program, the ability to recover these investments timely and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance.
during fiscal 2018, we recorded income from continuing operations of $603.1 million, or $5.43 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $382.7 million, or $3.60 per diluted share in the prior year.
after adjusting for the nonrecurring benefit recognized after implementing the tcja, we recognized adjusted income from continuing operations of $444.3 million, or $4.00 per diluted share for the year ended september 30, 2018, compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of $382.7 million, or $3.60 per diluted share for the year ended september 30, 2017. the year-over-year increase of $61.6 million, or 16 percent, largely reflects rate increases driven by safety and reliability spending, weather that was 36 percent colder than the prior year, customer growth in our distribution business and the impact of the tcja on our effective income tax rate, partially offset by reduced revenues as a result of implementing the tcja. during the year ended september 30, 2018, we completed 18 regulatory proceedings, resulting in an increase in annual operating income of $80.1 million and had 11 ratemaking efforts in progress at september 30, 2018, seeking a total increase in annual operating income of $52.8 million.

capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 totaled $1,467.6 million. over 80 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems, with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less. we funded our current-year capital expenditures program primarily through operating cash flows of $1,124.7 million. additionally, we issued $400 million of common stock during the year ended september 30, 2018. the net proceeds from the issuance were primarily used to repay short-term debt under our commercial paper program, to fund capital spending and for general corporate purposes. on october 4, 2018, we completed a public offering of $600 million 4.30% senior notes due 2048. we received net proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses of approximately $591 million, that were used to repay working capital borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program. the effective interest rate of these notes is 4.37% after giving effect to the offering costs.
as a result of the continued contribution and stability of our earnings, cash flows and capital structure, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 8.2% percent for fiscal 2019.
tcja impact the tcja introduced several significant changes to corporate income tax laws in the united states, which have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended september 30, 2018. as a rate regulated entity, the effects of lower tax rates included in our cost of service rates will ultimately flow through to our utility customers in the form of adjusted rates. therefore, the favorable impact of the reduction in our federal statutory income tax rate on our financial performance will be limited to items that impact our income before income taxes in the current period that have not yet been reflected in our rates (most notably increases to and decreases in commission-approved regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet) and market-based revenues that are earned from customers who utilize our assets. note 12 to the consolidated financial statements details the various impacts of the tcja on our financial position and results from operations. the most significant changes are summarized as follows:
•   because our fiscal year started on october 1, 2017, our federal statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was reduced from 35% to 24.5%. our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 27.5%, before the effect of the return of the excess deferred tax liability and the one-time, non-cash income tax benefit. our federal statutory income tax rate declined to 21% on october 1, 2018.
•   as a result of implementing the tcja, we remeasured our net deferred tax liability using our new federal statutory income tax rate, which reduced our net deferred tax liability by $905.3 million. of this amount, $746.5 million was reclassified to a regulatory liability called excess deferred tax liability. the remaining $158.8 million was recognized as a one-time, non-cash income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended september 30, 2018.
•   atmos energy supports our regulators' efforts to ensure our utility customers receive the full benefits of changes in our cost of service rates arising from tax reform. income taxes, like other costs, are passed through to our customers in our rates; however, changes to customer rates must be approved by our regulators.
◦   beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we established regulatory liabilities in all our jurisdictions for the difference in taxes included in our cost of service rates that have been calculated based on a 35% statutory income tax rate and a 21% statutory income tax rate, which reduced our revenues. we have received approval from most of our regulators to adjust customer rates for the lower statutory income tax rate.
◦   we have also received approval from regulators in several of our states to return amounts to customers related to the regulatory liability recorded for differences in our cost of service rates due to the change in the statutory income tax rate within one year.
◦   we have received approval from regulators in several of our states to begin returning the excess deferred tax liability created upon implementation of the tcja, as discussed above, over a period ranging from 18 to 40 years. for the year ended september 30, 2018, we amortized $1.6 million of this regulatory liability.
•   the enactment of the tcja is expected to reduce our future cash flows from operations primarily due to 1) the collection of taxes at a lower rate and 2) the return of regulatory liabilities established in response to the enactment of the tcja and regulatory activities to our utility customers. we intend to externally finance this reduction in operating cash flow in a balanced fashion in order to maintain an equity-to-total-capitalization ratio ranging from 50% to 60% to maintain our current credit ratings.

see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments.
distribution segment the distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. the primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas.
our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and, ultimately, separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns. improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. the "ratemaking activity" section of this form 10-k describes our current rate strategy, progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail.
we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore, increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. contribution margin in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. we record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes, other than

income. although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect contribution margin, over time the impact is offset within operating income.
although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our contribution margin, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. in addition, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources. currently, gas cost risk has been mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 76 percent of our residential and commercial margins.
during fiscal 2018, we completed 16 regulatory proceedings in our distribution segment, resulting in an $8.9 million increase in annual operating income.
review of financial and operating results financial and operational highlights for our distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented below.

fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2017
income before income taxes for our distribution segment decreased three percent, primarily due to an $88.3 million increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a $63.5 million increase in contribution margin. the year-to-date increase in contribution margin primarily reflects:
•   a $70.7 million net increase in rate adjustments, excluding rate adjustments resulting from the tcja, primarily in our mid-tex, kentucky/mid-states, mississippi and west texas divisions. these rate adjustments were driven primarily by increased safety and reliability spending.
•   a $12.2 million increase in net consumption, primarily in our mid-tex, mississippi, kentucky/mid-states and louisiana divisions.
•   a $14.8 million increase in revenue-related taxes primarily in our mid-tex division, offset by a corresponding $15.5 million increase in the related tax expense.
•   an $8.9 million increase in transportation margin primarily in our kentucky/mid-states division.
•   an $8.4 million increase from customer growth, primarily in our mid-tex division.
28
•   a $51.3 million decrease in contribution margin due to the inclusion of the lower statutory federal income tax rate in our revenues due to implementation of the tcja. of this amount, $30.0 million has been reflected in customer bills. the remaining $21.3 million relates to the establishment of regulatory liabilities for the difference between the former 35% federal statutory income tax rate and the current 21% rate.
the increase in operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, bad debt expense, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income, largely reflects expenses incurred after we decided to undertake a planned outage of our natural gas distribution system in northwest dallas that affected approximately 2,400 homes. while the system was replaced, we provided financial assistance to the affected residents and incurred other related costs of approximately $24 million.
the remaining increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related costs and incremental system integrity activities of $19.3 million, increased revenue-related taxes, as discussed above, and increased depreciation and property taxes of $22.5 million associated with increased capital investments.
interest charges decreased $13.9 million, primarily from interest deferrals associated with our infrastructure spending activities in texas and louisiana.
the decrease in income tax expense primarily reflects a reduction in our effective tax rate from 36.7% to 26.1%, as a result of the tcja. during fiscal 2018, in certain jurisdictions, we began amortizing the excess deferred income taxes in the amount of $1.6 million.
fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2016
income before income taxes for our distribution segment increased 16 percent, primarily due to a $98.5 million increase in contribution margin, partially offset by a $34.8 million increase in operating expenses. the year-over-year increase in contribution margin primarily reflects:
•   a $72.4 million net increase in rate adjustments, primarily in our mid-tex, louisiana, mississippi and west texas divisions. these rate adjustments were driven primarily by increased safety and reliability spending.
•   customer growth, primarily in our mid-tex and kentucky/mid-states divisions, which contributed an incremental $5.8 million.
•   a $5.8 million increase in transportation margin, primarily in the kentucky/mid-states and mid-tex divisions.
•   a $5.2 million increase in revenue-related taxes primarily in our mid-tex and west texas divisions, offset by a corresponding $5.1 million increase in the related tax expense.
•   a $2.9 million increase in net consumption, despite weather that was 12 percent warmer than the prior year.
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments, higher employee-related costs, increased revenue-related taxes, as discussed above, and higher pipeline maintenance and related activities, partially offset by lower legal costs.

pipeline and storage segment our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipeline-texas division (apt) and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana. apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central, northern and eastern texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale, the texas gulf coast and the delaware and midland basins of west texas. apt provides transportation and storage services to our mid-tex division, other third party local distribution companies, industrial and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers. as part of its pipeline operations, apt owns and operates five underground storage facilities in texas.
our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a proprietary 21-mile pipeline located in the new orleans, louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a long-term contract and, on a more limited basis, to third parties. the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission. we also manage two asset management plans, which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. generally, these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements.
our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our texas and louisiana service areas. natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas. however, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines. further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in texas could influences the volumes of gas transported for shippers through texas pipeline systems and rates for such transportation.
the results of apt are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers. additionally, its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs.
apt annually uses the gas reliability infrastructure program (grip) to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year. following the conclusion of its rate case in august 2017, apt made a grip filing that covered changes in net investment from october 1, 2016 through december 31, 2016 with a requested increase in operating income of $29.0 million. on december 5, 2017, the filing was approved. on february 15, 2018, apt made a grip filing that covered changes in net investment from january 1, 2017 through december 31, 2017 with a requested increase in operating income of $42.2 million. on may 22, 2018, the filing was approved.
on december 21, 2016, the louisiana public service commission approved an annual increase of five percent to the demand fee charged by our natural gas transmission pipeline for each of the next 10 years, effective october 1, 2017.

income before income taxes for our pipeline and storage segment increased ten percent, primarily due to a $51.2 million increase in contribution margin, partially offset by a $30.8 million increase in operating expenses. the increase in contribution margin primarily reflects:
•   a $74.3 million increase in rates from the approved apt rate case and the grip filings approved in december 2017 and may 2018. the increase in rates was driven primarily by increased safety and reliability spending.
•   a net increase of $1.3 million due to wider spreads and positive supply and demand dynamics affecting the permian basin.
•   a $24.1 million decrease in contribution margin due to the inclusion of the lower statutory federal income tax rate in our revenues due to implementation of the tcja. of this amount, $11.4 million has been reflected in customer bills. the remaining $12.7 million relates to the establishment of regulatory liabilities, as discussed above.
the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher depreciation expense of $25.8 million associated with increased capital investments and an increase in employee-related costs.
the decrease in income tax expense primarily reflects a reduction in our effective tax rate from 36.5% to 29.8%, as a result of the tcja.
fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2016
income before income taxes for our pipeline and storage segment increased slightly, primarily due to a $27.3 million increase in contribution margin, partially offset by a $20.7 million increase in operating expenses. the increase in contribution margin primarily reflects a $24.6 million increase in rates from the approved 2016 grip filing and the rate case finalized in august 2017 and higher through system revenue of $8.3 million, largely related to higher basis spreads due to increased production in the permian basin and incremental throughput on a pipeline acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in contribution margin of $2.3 million due to lower excess retention gas sales in the current year. as noted above, as a result of the annual rate case, we did not file our annual grip filing during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which influenced this segment's performance year-over-year.
operating expenses increased $20.7 million, primarily due to increased depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments.

natural gas marketing segment through december 31, 2016, we were engaged in an unregulated natural gas marketing business, which was conducted by atmos energy marketing (aem). aem's primary business was to aggregate and purchase gas supply, arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices.
as more fully described in note 15, effective january 1, 2017, we sold all of the equity interests of aem to centerpoint energy services, inc. (ces), a subsidiary of centerpoint energy inc. as a result of the sale, atmos energy has fully exited the nonregulated natural gas marketing business. accordingly, a gain on sale from discontinued operations for $2.7 million was recorded and net income of $11.0 million for aem is reported as discontinued operations for the year ended september 30, 2017, compared to net income of $4.6 million for aem reported for discontinued operations for the year ended september 30, 2016.
review of financial and operating results financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016 are presented below.

fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2016
the $9.1 million year-over-year increase in net income from discontinued operations primarily reflects the recognition of a net $6.6 million noncash gain from unwinding hedge accounting for certain of the natural gas marketing business's financial positions in connection with the sale of aem. additionally we recognized a $2.7 million net gain on sale upon completion of the sale of aem to ces in january 2017.
liquidity and capital resources the liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing. external debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of long-term debt, a $1.5 billion commercial paper program and three committed revolving credit facilities with a total availability from third-party lenders of approximately $1.5 billion. the commercial paper program and credit facilities provide cost-effective, short-term financing until it can be replaced with a balance of long-term debt and equity financing that achieves the company's desired capital structure with an equity-to-total-capitalization ratio between 50% and 60%, inclusive of long-term and short-term debt. additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis. the liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the company's working capital needs and capital expenditures program for fiscal year 2019 and beyond. please refer to the tcja impact section above regarding anticipated impacts on our liquidity, capital resources and cash flows.
to support our capital market activities, we have a registration statement on file with the sec that permits us to issue a total of $2.5 billion in common stock and/or debt securities. the shelf registration statement expires on march 26, 2019. under
32
the shelf registration statement, in november 2017, we filed a prospectus supplement for an at-the-market (atm) equity distribution program under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million.
at september 30, 2018, approximately $650.0 million of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement. on october 4, 2018, we completed a public offering of $600 million of 4.30% senior notes due 2048. the effective rate of this note is 4.37% after giving effect to the offering costs. we received net proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses of approximately $591 million, that were used to repay working capital borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program. the issuance of these notes effectively exhausted our existing shelf registration statement.
during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we intend to file a new registration statement for the issuance, from time to time, of up to $3.0 billion in common stock and/or debt securities  in addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we plan to enter into a new atm equity distribution agreement under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock, up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million, under the new shelf registration statement.

cash flows from operating activities year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income and working capital changes, particularly within our distribution segment resulting from changes in the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries.
fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2017
for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, we generated operating cash flows of $1,124.7 million compared with $867.1 million in the prior year. the year-over-year increase primarily reflects the positive cash effects of successful rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2017 driven primarily by increased safety and reliability spending and changes in working capital, primarily as a result of the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchase gas cost mechanisms as a result of a year-over-year increase in sale volumes. this increase in sales volumes also contributed to the year-over-year increase in operating cash flow.

fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2016
for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, we generated operating cash flows of $867.1 million compared with $795.0 million in fiscal 2016. the year-over-year increase primarily reflects the positive cash effect of successful rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2016.
cash flows from investing activities in recent years, we have used substantial amounts of cash to fund our ongoing construction program, which enables us to improve safety and reliability by modernizing our distribution and transmission system, used to provide distribution services to our existing customer base, expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets, enhance the integrity of our pipelines and, more recently, expand our intrastate pipeline network. over the last three fiscal years, approximately 82 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system.
in executing our regulatory strategy, we target our capital spending on regulatory mechanisms that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system. substantially all of our regulated jurisdictions have rate tariffs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case.
for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, we had $1,467.6 million in capital expenditures compared with $1,137.1 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 and $1,087.0 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016.
fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2017
the $330.5 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily reflects planned increases to modernize our distribution and transmission system, and increases in spending in our pipeline and storage segment to improve the reliability of gas service to our local distribution company customers. the year-over-year increase also reflects the absence in the current year period of $140.3 million in net proceeds received from the sale of aem, $29.8 million in proceeds received from the completion of a state of texas use tax audit and the $86.1 million used to acquire a pipeline in december 2016.
fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2016
the $50.1 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily reflects a:
•   $109.7 million increase due to planned increases in our distribution segment to replace vintage pipe.
•   $59.2 million decrease in spending in our pipeline and storage segment as a result of the substantial completion of an apt project to improve the reliability of gas service to its local distribution company customers.
cash flows from investing activities for the year ended september 30, 2017 also include proceeds of $140.3 million received from the sale of aem, proceeds received from the completion of a state of texas use tax audit and $86.1 million used to purchase a pipeline in the first fiscal quarter of 2017.
cash flows from financing activities we generated a net amount of $326.3 million, $168.1 million and $303.6 million in cash from financing activities for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:
2018
during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, our financing activities generated $326.3 million of cash compared with $168.1 million of cash generated in the prior year. the $158.2 million increase in cash provided by financing activities reflects higher net short-term borrowings due to increased capital expenditures and period-over-period changes in working capital funding needs compared to the prior year, as well as net proceeds received of $395.1 million from equity financing. cash dividends increased due to a 7.8% increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding.
2017
during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, our financing activities generated $168.1 million of cash compared with $303.6 million of cash generated in the prior year. the $135.5 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the reduction in our short-term debt, partially offset by an increase in our long-term debt.
during fiscal 2017, we completed approximately $975 million of debt and equity financing. on june 8, 2017, we completed a public offering of $500 million of 3.00% senior unsecured notes due 2027 and $250 million of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due 2044. the net proceeds of approximately $753 million were used to repay our $250 million 6.35% senior unsecured notes at maturity on june 15, 2017 and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of working capital
34
borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program. in october 2016, we issued $125 million of long-term debt under our three year, $200 million multi-draw term loan agreement.
additionally, during fiscal 2017 we issued 1.3 million shares under our atm program and received net proceeds of $98.8 million. as of september 30, 2017, substantially all of shares under this program had been issued.
2016
during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016, our financing activities generated $303.6 million of cash compared with $131.1 million of cash generated in fiscal 2015. the increase is primarily due to higher net short-term borrowings due to increased capital expenditures and period-over-period changes in working capital funding needs compared to the prior year, as well as proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our atm program in the third fiscal quarter of 2016.

credit ratings our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. in determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status. in addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the quality of our management and business strategy and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate.
our debt is rated by two rating agencies: standard & poor's corporation (s&p) and moody's investors service (moody's). as of september 30, 2018, both rating agencies maintained a stable outlook.
our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows:
s&amp;p     moody's senior unsecured long-term debt   a           a2
short-term debt                   a-1         p-1
a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies. this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings.
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for s&p and aaa for moody's. the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb- for s&p and baa3 for moody's. our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant.

we maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts. our mid-tex division also maintains a limited number of long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices. at september 30, 2018, we were committed to purchase 54.1 bcf within one year and 37.2 bcf within two to three years under indexed contracts.
the passage of the tcja resulted in the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability. at september 30, 2018, we recorded $744.9 million, which relates to our regulated operations and has been recorded as a regulatory liability. the period and timing of the return of the excess deferred taxes is being determined by regulators in each of our jurisdictions. see note 12 for further information.
risk management activities we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and, periodically, to manage interest rate risk. in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. additionally, we manage interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings.
we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices.

employee benefits programs an important element of our total compensation program, and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense, is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees. these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs.
medical and dental insurance we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees. we believe these programs are compliant with all current regulatory provisions and are consistent with other programs in our industry. in recent years, we have endeavored to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices.
over the last five fiscal years, we have experienced annual medical and prescription inflation of approximately seven percent. for fiscal 2019, we anticipate the medical and prescription drug inflation rate will increase at approximately six percent, primarily due to the inflation of health care costs and normalization of large claim activity.
net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was $41.4 million, compared with $49.0 million and $46.0 million for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016. these costs are recoverable through our rates. a portion of these costs is capitalized into our distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense.
our fiscal 2018 costs were determined using a september 30, 2017 measurement date. at that date, interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30, 2016, the measurement date for our fiscal 2017 net periodic cost. therefore, we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2018 net periodic cost from 3.73 percent to 3.89 percent. we lowered the expected return on plan assets from 7.00 percent to 6.75 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2018 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation. on october 20, 2017, the society of actuaries released its annually-updated mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the united states. as of september 30, 2017, we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated mortality table. as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions, our fiscal 2018 pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year.
our fiscal 2017 costs were determined using a september 30, 2016 measurement date. at that date, interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30,

2015, the measurement date for our fiscal 2016 net periodic cost. therefore, we decreased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2017 net periodic cost from 4.55 percent to 3.73 percent. we maintained the expected return on plan assets of 7.00 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2017 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation. on october 20, 2016, the society of actuaries released its annually-updated mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the united states. as of september 30, 2016, we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated mortality table. as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions, our fiscal 2017 pension and postretirement medical costs were consistent with the prior year.
pension and postretirement plan funding generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa). however, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.
in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 (ppa), we determined the funded status of our plans as of january 1, 2018, 2017 and 2016. based on these valuations, we have not had a minimum required contribution for the last three fiscal years. however, we made voluntary contributions of $7.0 million, $5.0 million and $15.0 million to our pension plans during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 to achieve a desired ppa funding threshold.
we contributed $17.4 million, $13.7 million and $16.6 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016. the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions.
outlook for fiscal 2019 and beyond as of september 30, 2018, interest and corporate bond rates were higher than the rates as of september 30, 2017. therefore, we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2019 net periodic cost from 3.89 percent to 4.38 percent. the expected return on plan assets remained consistent with the prior year at 6.75 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2019 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation. on october 23, 2018, the society of actuaries released its annually-updated mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the united states. as of september 30, 2018, we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated mortality table. as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions, we expect our fiscal 2019 net periodic pension cost to be lower than fiscal 2018.
based upon current market conditions, the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements under the ppa, we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2019. however, we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels. the amount of this funding is contingent upon several factors, including the issuance of new mortality tables by the us treasury department used to establish plan funding requirements. with respect to our postretirement medical plans, we anticipate contributing between $10 million and $20 million during fiscal 2019.
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized. a 0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $2.5 million. a 0.25 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $1.4 million.
the projected liability, future funding requirements and the amount of expense or income recognized for each of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are subject to change, depending on the actuarial value of plan assets, and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent calculation date.  these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest rates, changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plans and other actuarial assumptions.

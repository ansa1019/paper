risk factors. the companies reviewed the overall compensation pay structure, the overall mix of compensation vehicles, the structure of the incentive plans, other company pay plans, and governance for oversight of program design and administration. with respect to incentive plan structure, the companies specifically examined target and maximum compensation payable from each plan, the nature and mix of performance measures, the governance structure, the risk of earnings manipulation posed by the incentive structure, and the extent to which the neo pay program rewards short-term decisions at the risk of long-term performance. the companies also generally considered other compensation policies (such as clawback and anti-hedging policies), other compensation plans relating to severance and change-in-control benefits, and compensation governance.
for 2018, pay governance concluded that there were no material issues regarding the companies' executive pay programs, and that the design of the companies' incentive pay plans has, overall, a low-risk profile.
to further ensure appropriate incentive metrics, the compensation committee also receives advice from the safety and nuclear oversight committees regarding appropriate safety and operational incentive measures.
based on the foregoing, pg&e corporation and the utility concluded that the risks arising from the companies'
overall compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on either the corporation or the utility.
tax deductibility with the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, section 162(m) of the internal revenue code no longer permits companies to deduct certain qualified performance-based executive compensation. as a result, in establishing compensation for 2018, the committee no longer considered the tax deductibility limitations imposed by section 162(m).
despite the new limits on the deductibility of performance-based compensation, the committee continues to believe that a significant portion of neo compensation should be tied to company performance.

table of contents the following charts illustrate the percentage of target 2018 compensation allocated to base salary plus cash perquisite allowance, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives for the pg&e corporation ceo and for the other neos on average. (short-term incentives are shown at target payout levels, and long-term equity incentives are shown at 100 percent payout.)
for 2018, the compensation committee believes that these proportions of base salary relative to target short-term and long-term incentives provided the right mix to attract, retain, and motivate officers with the necessary skills and experience for the development and successful operation of pg&e corporation's and the utility's businesses.
they also provided a direct connection between compensation and performance in both the achievement of key operating results and long-term shareholder value, as more fully described below.
a greater portion of the pg&e corporation ceo's 2018 target compensation is tied to the long-term performance of pg&e corporation, which the committee believes is appropriate given the ceo's role.
compensation paid to the neos was consistent with the types and forms of compensation provided during 2018 to all executive officers of the companies.
components of 2018 officer compensation - cash base salary for neo compensation, the base salary component falls within a range of 10 percent to 40 percent of target total compensation, depending on officer level.
this is consistent with the compensation committee's objective of tying a significant portion of every neo's compensation directly to pg&e corporation's performance for shareholders through short-term and long-term incentives.
for 2018, the committee approved a base salary increase budget of 3.25 percent. the comparative data indicated that the companies in the pay comparator group expected to provide officers a 3.20 percent average salary increase in
2018.
in the case of neos, the base salary at pg&e corporation and the utility are targeted to be within a range of between 15 percent above and 15 percent below (the "15 percent band") the median base salary of the appropriate benchmark position. the committee believes that this level of comparability to the market is appropriate and consistent with its pay philosophy of taking into consideration factors other than market data in establishing individual pay levels, while delivering cash compensation that is competitive with the market.
short-term incentives the stip is an at-risk component of pay. neos and other eligible employees may earn annual performance-based cash incentive compensation under the stip based on achievement of financial and operational goals approved by the committee and an individual executive's achievements for the year. the committee retains complete discretion to determine and pay all stip awards to neos and other eligible employees. this includes discretion to reduce the final score on any and all measures downward to zero.

2018 stip structure and results for 2018, the committee adopted a stip structure that continued pg&e corporation's and the utility's focus on improving public and employee and contractor safety and customer satisfaction. the weights of the components -
safety, customer satisfaction, and financial - were unchanged from 2017 at 50 percent, 25 percent, and 25 percent, respectively.
the safety component was structured to provide a strong focus on the safety of employees, customers, and communities. it was made up of five subcomponents: (1) nuclear operations safety, (2) electric operations safety,
(3) electric and gas operations safety, (4) gas operations safety, and (5) employee safety. three new safety measures were added for 2018 - public safety index with a weight of 10 percent, asset mapping duration index with a weight of 10 percent, and safe driving rate with a weight of 5 percent.
the customer satisfaction measures were designed to incent employees to be more responsive to customers' needs. one new customer satisfaction measure was added for 2018 - customer connection cycle time with a weight of 10 percent.
as in prior years, corporate financial performance was measured by pg&e corporation's actual earnings from operations compared to budget.
each stip measure has a threshold, target, and maximum level of performance used to arrive at a score ranging from zero to 2.0 for that measure. performance below the minimum performance level, or threshold, results in a zero score. performance at the threshold results in a stip score of 0.5. target performance results in a stip score of
1.0, and performance at or above the maximum established level results in a score of 2.0. a score of 1.0 provides
100 percent of an executive's target payout. performance at the threshold and maximum levels delivers 50 percent and 200 percent of targeted payout, respectively. linear interpolation is used to determine scores for performance between threshold and target, and between target and maximum.
the stip overall performance score is the sum of the weighted cumulative average scores for performance on each of the stip measures.
an neo's final stip score also may be increased or decreased by an individual performance modifier, which can range from 0 percent to 150 percent. the individual performance modifier is determined by the committee based upon the pg&e corporation ceo's assessment of an executive's performance, or the applicable board's assessment in the case of the ceo's or the utility president's (or equivalent officer's) performance, for the year.
for 2018, the measures and related weightings, thresholds, targets, maximums, and results for calculating the stip performance score were as follows:

table of contents the measures in the foregoing table are defined below.
diablo canyon power plant reliability and safety indicator-year-end score for the utility's diablo canyon power plant units 1 and 2 based on 11 performance indicators developed by the nuclear industry for nuclear power generation.
public safety index-a weighted index of three programs that evaluate compliance in the cpuc high fire-threat district (hftd).
asset records duration index-an equally-weighted index comprised of gas and electric asset record duration indices tracking the average number of days to complete the as-built process of capital and expense jobs.
gas in-line inspection and upgrade index-index measuring the utility's ability to complete planned in-line inspections and pipeline retrofit projects.
gas dig-ins reduction-number of third-party dig-ins to the utility's gas assets per 1,000 underground service alert tickets.
serious injuries and fatalities (sif) corrective action index-index measuring two equally-weighted measures of response to sif events: (1) quality of corrective actions, and (2) timely completion of corrective actions.
safe driving rate-the total number of vehicle safety technology (vst) in-vehicle performance monitor alerts for hard braking and hard acceleration per thousand miles driven.
customer satisfaction score-overall satisfaction of customers with the products and services offered by the utility, as measured through an ongoing survey.
customer connection cycle time-the 12-month average service planning and construction cycle time for electric residential express connections new business work requested by utility customers.
earnings from operations (efo)-pg&e corporation's actual earnings from operations, excluding items impacting comparability compared to budget. the measurement is non-gaap. please see exhibit a for a reconciliation of pg&e corporation's earnings from operations to income available for common shareholders in accordance with gaap.
individual awards determination stip cash awards to neos are calculated as follows:
determine the executive's individual stip target, which is the neo's base salary earned during the year
1.  multiplied by the individual's stip participation rate.
calculate the overall enterprise-wide stip performance score, which can range from 0 to 2.0 and is
2.  calculated based on final results compared to the threshold, target, and maximum of each weighted measure.
27

3.  multiply the stip target by the performance score to determine the calculated company award.
4.  multiply the calculated company award by the neo's individual performance modifier.
the committee (and the independent members of the pg&e corporation and utility boards of directors in the
5.  case of the ceo and any president (or equivalent) of the respective companies) approves all final awards and has discretion to adjust all stip awards.
for 2018, the committee approved neo participation rates that ranged from 45 percent to 130 percent of base salary
(the 130 percent participation rate applies only to the pg&e corporation ceo). this range is within the 15 percent band of the pay comparator group's median annual incentive participation rates.
for 2018, the committee and the independent members of each of the pg&e corporation and utility boards of directors exercised their discretion to adjust awards for neos and the pg&e corporation ceo and pacific gas and electric company principal executive officers, setting the company score to zero. no stip awards were paid to neos for 2018.
long-term incentives long-term incentive awards granted in 2018
ltip awards (both annual and mid-year) are granted consistent with the pg&e corporation equity grant date policy
(see discussion below under "equity grant dates").

in february 2018, the compensation committee (and the independent members of the pg&e corporation board in the case of ms. williams, and the independent members of the utiilty board in the case of mr. stavropoulos) approved annual ltip awards for 2018, which were granted in may 2018.
target annual ltip award values for 2018 for the neos were determined based on competitive market data, internal equity considerations, and advice from pay governance. the annual ltip awards for 2018 granted to the neos were comprised of 35 percent performance shares using relative tsr, safety, and financial measures, 20 percent nonqualified stock options, and 45 percent rsus.
for 2018, the committee believes that this allocation of performance shares, stock options and rsus closely aligned neo compensation with long-term pg&e corporation performance and shareholder value. because performance shares, stock options and rsus each vest over a three-year period and increase or decrease in value depending on the performance of pg&e corporation common stock, these awards are at risk based on corporate performance, and align the interests of neos with performance for shareholders.
additional details regarding performance shares, stock options and rsus are provided below.
performance shares - tsr performance shares are hypothetical shares of pg&e corporation common stock tied directly to pg&e corporation's performance for shareholders, and generally vest only at the end of a three-year performance period.
28
table of contents the number of performance shares with a tsr measure granted in may 2018 to each neo was determined by multiplying
35 percent of the neo's actual annual ltip award value for 2018 by 20 percent and dividing the result by the grant date fair value of a performance share as determined by a monte carlo simulation.
performance shares with a tsr measure granted in may 2018 will vest, if at all, following completion of the three-
year performance period starting january 1, 2018 and ending december 31, 2020 and upon certification of performance results by the compensation committee, which will occur no later than march 14, 2021. the payout value of any vested performance shares will be based on pg&e corporation's tsr relative to the 2018 performance comparator group for the period. the payment for performance shares will be in the form of stock and will be calculated by multiplying (1) the number of vested performance shares by (2) a payout factor based on the corporation's relative tsr performance compared to the performance comparator group.
as shown in the following 2018 performance share payout scale, payouts of performance shares are linked to pg&e corporation's tsr performance compared to the performance comparator group. 60 th percentile performance is required for a 100 percentpayout.

interpolation will be used if pg&e corporation's tsr performance does not fall directly on one of the listed performance percentiles.
performance shares - safety and financial the number of performance shares with safety and financial measures granted in march 2018 to each neo was determined by multiplying 35 percent of the neo's actual annual ltip award value for 2018 by 15 percent and dividing the result by the closing price of a share of pg&e corporation common stock on march 1, 2018.
performance shares with safety and financial measures granted in march 2018 will vest, if at all, following completion of the three-year performance period starting january 1, 2018 and ending december 31, 2020 and upon certification of quantifiable performance results by the compensation committee, which will occur no later than march 14, 2021. the measures were designed to provide a direct focus on long-term safety and financial goals. the payout value of any vested performance shares will be based on achievement of safety and financial goals. the safety measure measures the total number of repeat sif actual or potential injury or near-hit events per 200,000
hours worked. the financial measure compares earnings from operations (efo) per share in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to the mid-point of the guidance range for each year. in the event that guidance is not issued until after february of the target year, the target will be set based on the board-approved efo forecast for the year. awards pay out at 25
percent for threshold (95 percent of mid-point) performance, 100 percent for target (mid-point) performance, and
200 percent for maximum (105 percent of mid-point) performance. interpolation will be used if results do not fall directly on the minimum, target, or maximum goal. the payment for performance shares will be in the form of stock and will be calculated by multiplying (1) the number of vested performance shares by (2) a payout factor based on achievement of performance goals.

table of contents restricted stock units rsus are hypothetical shares of stock that are settled in an equal number of shares of pg&e corporation common stock, and generally vest only if the officer remains employed over the vesting period. because the value of rsus varies with the price of pg&e corporation common stock, rsus align officers' interests with those of shareholders
(i.e., stock price appreciation and dividends). the multi-year vesting period also serves a retention purpose. the number of rsus granted in march 2018 to each neo was determined by multiplying the neo's actual annual ltip award value for 2018 by 45 percent and dividing the result by the closing price of a share of pg&e corporation common stock on march 1, 2018. annual rsu awards granted in 2018 will vest in three tranches, with one-third vesting on the first business day of march of each of the three years following the grant date. the $500,000 retention rsu award granted to mr. soto on june 26, 2018 vests one-third on june 26, 2020 and two-thirds on june 26, 2021. the
$300,000 promotional rsu award granted to mr. malnight on september 4, 2018 vests on september 4, 2020.
nonqualified stock options a stock option is the right to acquire shares at a fixed exercise price for a fixed time. the exercise price of each option is based on the closing price of the stock on the nyse on the date of grant. options vest and become exercisable ratably during each of the three years following the grant date. options expire at the close of business ten years after the date of grant, after which time the options cease to be exercisable. because the value of stock options varies with the price of pg&e corporation common stock and because options have a ten-year expiration period, stock options align officers'
interests with those of shareholders while reflecting a longer-term view of the companies' business environment. the number of stock options granted in march 2018 to each neo was determined by multiplying the neo's actual annual ltip award value by 20
percent and dividing the result by the black-scholes american call model value per share on the date of grant.
performance shares vested in 2018
the three-year performance cycle for annual performance share awards that were granted in 2015 under the 2006 ltip ended on december 31, 2017. these awards vested on march 1, 2018, and payouts are reported in this amendment no. 1
in the table entitled "option exercises and stock vested during 2018" under this item 11.
for that performance period, pg&e corporation's tsr fell between 13th and 14th rank when compared to the 14
companies in the 2015 performance comparator group. this ranking resulted in no payout with respect to the 2015
performance share awards using a tsr measure. pg&e corporation's tsr performance for the three-year period was 4.5
percent, as compared to the median tsr of 45.0 percent among the 2015 performance comparator group companies for the same period.
performance shares vested in 2019
fifty percent of awards granted under the ltip in 2016 were allocated to performance shares using a relative tsr measure. the three-year performance cycle ended on december 31, 2018. these awards vested on february 19, 2019 and any payouts for these awards would be expected to be reflected in the 2019 proxy statement. for that period, pg&e corporation's tsr fell lowest when compared to the 14 companies in the 2016 performance comparator group. this ranking resulted in no payout with respect to the 2016 performance share awards using a tsr measure. pg&e corporation's tsr performance for the three-year period was negative 50.5 percent, as compared to the median tsr of
51.2 percent among the 2016 performance comparator group companies for the same period. a 20-day average is used to determine the beginning and ending values for the calculation.
ten percent of awards granted under the ltip in 2016 were allocated to performance shares with the payout determined by measuring performance against equally-weighted safety and affordability goals. safety performance, as measured by the 2016 through 2018 lost workday case rate was below the threshold target. affordability, as measured by three-year efficiency gains versus a $100 million target, achieved a 2.0 score, with savings of $279 million, which is significantly above the $200 million maximum target. the overall result was a 100 percent payout in 2019
for these performance shares, which represented 10 percent of the total 2016 target ltip award.

equity grant dates the pg&e corporation equity grant date policy, as last amended in september 2017, generally provides that annual ltip awards are granted once per year on march 1 (or if that day is not a business day, then on the following business day). the pg&e corporation board or the compensation committee may determine a different grant date if appropriate or necessary. the grant date for non-annual equity awards to employees (such as for newly hired or newly promoted officers or awards made for retention, recognition, or other purposes) is the later of (1) the date that the non-annual award is approved by the independent members of the pg&e corporation or utility board, the compensation committee, or the pg&e corporation ceo, as applicable, (2) the effective date of the ltip award recipient's employment, promotion, or recognition, or (3) the date otherwise specified by the applicable board, the committee, or the corporation ceo. if the grant date of any non-annual ltip award would occur during a trading blackout period, as defined under the pg&e corporation insider trading policy, then the actual grant date will be the first business day after the trading blackout period ends.
other elements of executive compensation in 2018
perquisites and related compensation neos generally receive a limited range of perquisite benefits, typically encompassing a partial subsidy for financial planning services from a third-party financial advisory firm, partial reimbursement of certain health club fees, on-site parking, executive health services, and de minimisperquisites under a pre-approved perquisite policy. the pg&e corporation ceo and the utility president also may receive safety-and security-based car transportation services. the magnitude of these perquisites, including the lump-sum payment described in the following paragraph, is comparable to that provided to executive officers of companies in the pay comparator group, and the value of these services is taxable to the recipient.
the compensation committee (and the independent members of the pg&e corporation board in the case of ms. williams, and the independent members of the utility board in the case of mr. stavropoulos) also approved a 2018 lump-sum annual stipend amount for each executive officer consistent with 2017, which ranged from $15,000 to $35,000 (the upper end applicable only to ms. williams). this stipend is provided in lieu of providing the neos with additional perquisite benefits. the neos have discretion to use this stipend as they see fit.
the pg&e corporation ceo is authorized to use private aircraft for business travel under appropriate circumstances.
the utility's corporate aircraft use policy prohibits use of utility aircraft for personal travel.
post-retirement benefits neos are eligible to receive retirement benefits under the utility's tax-qualified defined benefit plan
("retirement plan"), which also provides benefits to other eligible employees of pg&e corporation and the utility.
retirement plan benefits are in the form of either a final average pay pension benefit or a cash balance benefit.
all neos except messrs. hogan and thomason also are eligible to receive benefits under the pg&e corporation supplemental executive retirement plan ("serp"), which is a non-tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides officers and key employees of the corporation and its subsidiaries, including the utility, with an additional pension benefit. these plans are described in the section entitled "pension benefits-2018" under this item 11.
in february 2010, the committee adopted a policy against crediting additional years of service for participants in the serp.
effective january 1, 2013, serp participation was closed to new participants. individuals who did not participate in the serp but who were newly hired or promoted to officer after january 1, 2013 are eligible for non-tax-
qualified defined contribution pension payments under the 2013 pg&e corporation defined contribution executive supplemental retirement plan ("dc-esrp"). messrs. hogan and thomason were the only neos who participate in the dc-
esrp. the dc-esrp is described in more detail in the section entitled "non-qualified deferred compensation - 2018"
under this item 11.
31
table of contents neos and other officers and employees also are eligible to participate in the pg&e corporation retirement savings plan ("rsp"), a tax-qualified 401(k) plan. pg&e corporation provides a maximum matching contribution of 75 cents for each dollar contributed, up to 6 percent of base salary for individuals eligible for the final average pay pension benefit and up to 8 percent of base salary for individuals eligible for a cash balance pension benefit. to the extent that the internal revenue code limits prevent an neo from making contributions to his or her rsp account and, as a result, company matching funds are not contributed to that neo's rsp account, the matching funds will instead be contributed to the neo's account in the pg&e corporation 2005 supplemental retirement savings plan
("srsp"), a non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
upon retirement, neos also may be eligible for post-retirement health, welfare, insurance, and similar benefits, pursuant to plans that generally provide benefits to all employees. additional details regarding the retirement programs and post-retirement benefits, and the value of pension benefits accumulated as of december 31, 2018 for the neos, can be found in the table entitled "pension benefits-2018" under this item 11, the table entitled "non-
qualified deferred compensation - 2018" under this item 11, and the section entitled "potential payments-resignation/retirement" under this item 11.
most companies in the 2018 pay comparator group provide tax-qualified pensions or similar plans, other tax-
qualified defined contribution plans (e.g., 401(k) plans), and non-tax-qualified retirement plans for neos. the committee believes that these defined benefit and defined contribution plans offer significant recruiting and retention incentives.
officer severance program general severance benefits are provided to neos through the 2012 pg&e corporation officer severance policy
("officer severance policy") and specific ltip award agreements and guidelines. upon termination by either company
(other than for cause), neos may be eligible for cash severance payments, continued or accelerated vesting for ltip awards, and other post-employment benefits. if an neo is terminated for cause (e.g., for dishonesty, a criminal offense, or violation of a work rule) or resigns before becoming retirement-eligible, the neo forfeits any unvested performance shares, stock options, and rsus, and would not receive any associated dividends.
officer severance policy the purpose of the officer severance policy is to (1) attract and retain senior management by providing severance benefits that are part of a competitive total compensation package, (2) provide consistent treatment for all terminated officers, and (3) minimize potential litigation costs in connection with terminations of employment by conditioning payments upon a general release of claims.
the officer severance policy, in combination with ltip award agreements generally provides the following benefits upon termination without cause:
●  cash severance of one year's salary and target stip bonus.
●  pro-rata vesting of performance shares.
●  continued vesting of unvested rsus for one year.
●  continued vesting of stock options for one year, with an exercise period the lesser of 5 years or the remaining term of the options.
●  limited cobra benefits and outplacement services.
additional details regarding severance benefits can be found in the section entitled "potential payments-termination without cause" under this item 11.

table of contents change in control providing change-in-control severance benefits is a key part of the companies' officer compensation program. in a hostile takeover or other change-in-control situation, it is important for management to remain focused on maximizing shareholder value and aligning management's interests with shareholders' interests, and not to be distracted by concerns about job security.
change-in-control benefits require a "double trigger" and are not payable based on a change-in-control event alone, as described below. the compensation committee believes that the "double trigger" requirement aligns our change-in-
control benefits with shareholder interests and reflects current market practices.
the officer severance policy provides enhanced cash severance benefits if the officer's employment is terminated
(including constructive termination by the officer for good reason) in connection with a change in control (as defined in the policy). these enhanced benefits replace general severance benefits and are available only to officers in bands 1 or 2, which, as of december 31, 2018, included ms. williams and messrs. malnight, wells, simon, and stavropoulos. covered officers are eligible to receive (1) change-in-control cash severance benefits equal to two times the sum of base salary and target annual stip bonus, and (2) prorated stip bonus for the year of termination. other neos receive general severance benefits only.
all ltip award agreements contain change-in-control provisions that accelerate vesting of all awards if there is a change in control, and either the award is not continued, assumed, or substituted, or the recipient's employment is terminated in connection with a change in control. this practice aligns pg&e corporation and the utility with market practices and (1) better balances the interests of award recipients and shareholders, (2) provides security for award recipients in a time of uncertainty, and (3) preserves the incentive for award recipients to stay with the corporation or the utility even following a transaction.
the golden parachute restriction policy requires shareholder approval of certain executive severance payments (as defined in the golden parachute restriction policy) provided in connection with a change in control of pg&e corporation, to the extent that those payments exceed 2.99 times the sum of a covered officer's base salary and target stip award.
additional details regarding change-in-control benefits can be found in the section entitled "potential payments-severance in connection with change in control" under this item 11.
5. 2019 neo compensation program on january 29, 2019, pg&e corporation and the utility each filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11
in the bankruptcy court.
as a result of the chapter 11 cases, the 2019 executive compensation program may differ significantly from that in prior years. in addition, certain compensation provided to executive officers during the pendency of the chapter 11
cases may be subject in certain instances to approval by the bankruptcy court. the committee has been working with its advisors, including wtw, to review the 2019 executive compensation program in an effort to balance the financial situation facing the companies, the need to continue to recruit and retain qualified executives to guide the companies through a period of uncertainty, including the unpredictability of the stock price, and the resulting effect on the incentive and retentive value of equity-based awards. in february 2019, the committee determined that the neos will not participate in the 2019 stip and expects that the companies will continue to evaluate all aspects of the 2019 executive compensation program, including base salary, short- and long-term incentives, and other benefits.
6. committee conclusion the compensation committee believes that the amount and design of executive compensation provided for 2018 to the neos of pg&e corporation and the utility are consistent with the committee's compensation objectives and policies to (1) provide long-term incentives to align shareholders' and officers' interests and enhance total return for shareholders, (2) attract, retain, and motivate officers with the necessary mix of skills and experience for the development and successful operation of the corporation's and the utility's businesses, and (3) compensate neos in a competitive, cost-efficient, and transparent manner.

(before the tax impact of $979 million) during the three and twelve months ended december 31, 2018, respectively, related to third-party claims. the utility also recorded $85 million (before the tax impact
(3)  of $24 million) and $205 million
(before the tax impact of $57 million) during the three and twelve months ended december 31, 2018, respectively, for legal and other costs. in addition, the utility incurred costs of $40 million (before the tax impact of $11 million) during the twelve months ended december 31, 2018 for utility clean-up and repair costs. these costs were partially offset by $456 million (before the tax impact of $128 million) and $842 million (before the tax impact of $236 million) recorded during the three and twelve months ended december 31, 2018, respectively, for probable insurance recoveries.

the utility reduced the estimated disallowance for gas-related capital costs that were expected to exceed authorized amounts by $38 million (before the tax impact of $11 million) during the twelve months ended december 31, 2018. the utility had
(6)  previously recorded $85 million (before the tax impact of $35 million) in 2016 for probable capital disallowances in the 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case. from 2012 through 2014, the utility had recorded cumulative charges of $665 million
(before the tax impact of $271 million) for disallowed pipeline safety enhancement plan- related capital expenditures.

table of contents as a result of the cpuc's june 2018 decision authorizing a wildfire expense memorandum account, the
(7)  utility recorded $32 million (before the tax impact of $9 million) during the twelve months ended december 31, 2018 for probable cost recoveries of insurance premiums incurred in 2017 above amounts included in authorized revenue requirements.
"earnings from operations" is a non-gaap financial measure and is calculated as income available for common shareholders less items impacting comparability as described in note (1) above. pg&e corporation uses earnings from operations to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various purposes, including internal budgeting and forecasting, short-
(8)  and long-term operating plans, and employee incentive compensation. pg&e corporation believes that non-gaap earnings from operations provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business allowing for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance. earnings from operations is not a substitute or alternative for gaap measures such as consolidated income available for common shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

compensation opportunity granted for 2018 under the stip. actual amounts earned are reported in the summary compensation table in the "non-equity
(1)  incentive plan compensation" column. threshold represents a 0.5 enterprise-wide stip performance score and a 100 percent individual performance modifier. maximum reflects a 2.0 enterprise-wide stip performance score and a 150 percent individual performance modifier.
(2)  represents performance shares granted under the 2014 ltip. threshold equals 0.25 times target. maximum equals 2.0 times target.
(3)  represents rsus granted under the 2014 ltip.
(4)  represents stock options granted under the 2014 ltip.
for performance shares with a relative tsr measure, the grant date fair value is based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions, measured using a monte carlo simulation valuation model. the assumed per-share value for the
2018 annual awards was $34.23. the simulation model applies a risk-free interest rate and an expected volatility assumption. the risk-free rate is assumed to equal the yield on a three-year treasury bond on the grant date. volatility is based on historical volatility for the 36-month period preceding the grant date. for stock options, the grant date fair value is based on a black-scholes american call valuation model. the assumed per-share value for the 2018 annual awards was $10.23. the simulation model includes assumptions about dividend policy, duration, and volatility. the dividend policy assumption
(5)  anticipates a dividend suspension of four years and later resumption of the dividend at the 15-year average dividend yield (3.1%). expected duration of the options is the midpoint between the average vesting of all the options in an award
(two years) and the time to expiration of the award (ten years), or six years. in absence of publicly-available transactions or information associated with implied volatility for a 10-year or 5-year option on pg&e corporation common stock, volatility was estimated using data on historical volatility and implied volatility extrapolated from options with shorter duration, which provided a range from approximately 19% to approximately 26%;
the mid-point of that range (23%)
was used for the volatility assumption.  for rsus and performance shares with safety and financial measures, the grant date fair value is based on the pg&e corporation stock price at close on the grant date.

table of contents detailed information regarding compensation reported in the tables entitled "summary compensation table-2018" and
"grants of plan-based awards in 2018," including the relative amounts apportioned to different elements of compensation, can be found in the cd&a. information regarding specific grants and arrangements is provided below.
stip awards information regarding the terms and basis of stip awards can be found in the cd&a.
performance shares annual performance shares granted in 2018 will vest, if at all, at the end of a three-year period. upon vesting, performance shares are settled in shares of pg&e corporation common stock, net of the number of shares having a value equal to required withholding taxes. for performance shares using a relative tsr measure, the number of shares issued will depend on pg&e corporation's tsr relative to the 2018 performance comparator group for the three-year performance period. for performance shares with safety and financial measures, the number of shares issued will depend on achievement of safety and financial goals. the specific payout formulas are discussed in the cd&a.
each time that a cash dividend is paid on pg&e corporation common stock, an amount equal to the cash dividend per share multiplied by the number of performance shares granted to the recipient will be accrued on behalf of the recipient. at the end of the vesting period, the amount of accrued dividend equivalents will be increased or decreased by the same payout factor used to increase or decrease the number of vested performance shares for the period.

retirement plan additional information regarding compensation reported in the "pension benefits-2018" table, and any associated policies, can be found in the cd&a. the present value of accumulated benefits as of december 31, 2018 is determined assuming that the neos retire at the earliest unreduced retirement age, using mortality and interest assumptions consistent with those used in preparing pg&e corporation's and the utility's financial statements. the rp-2014
"employees" mortality table was used without collar or amount adjustments (adjusted to 2011 using a variation of mp-2014). rates were projected on a generational basis from 2011 using a variation of mp-2014. interest discount rates of 4.35 percent and 4.29 percent were used for the pacific gas and electric company retirement plan
("retirement plan") and the pg&e corporation supplemental executive retirement plan ("serp"), respectively.
for 2018, the pension benefits described in the above table are provided to officers under two plans.
the utility provides retirement benefits to all its employees, including its officers, under the retirement plan, which is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. the retirement plan historically also has provided benefits to a significant number of pg&e corporation's employees and officers. as of april 1, 2007, all pg&e corporation employees and officers are eligible to participate in the retirement plan.
the retirement plan has two forms of benefit. with respect to the retirement plan's final pay benefit formula, a participating officer may begin receiving tax-qualified pension benefits at age 55, but benefits will be reduced unless the individual has at least 35 years of service. at age 65, a participant becomes eligible for an unreduced pension, irrespective of the years of service. between age 55 and age 65, any pension benefit may be reduced based on the number of years of service, and in accordance with the retirement plan's early retirement reduction factors.
the normal benefit formula is 1.7 percent of the average annual salary for the last 36 months of service multiplied by years of credited service. the default form of benefit is a single-life annuity for participants who are unmarried at retirement or a 50 percent joint spousal annuity for married participants. however, other types of joint pensions are available, and participants may designate non-spousal joint pensioners (subject to spousal consent).
effective january 1, 2013, a cash balance benefit was added to the retirement plan. employees hired or re-hired on or after january 1, 2013 participate in the cash balance benefit. employees hired before january 1, 2013 were given a one-time opportunity during 2013 to irrevocably select to switch to the cash balance benefit on a going-forward basis, effective january 1, 2014, or to retain the final pay benefit to which they were otherwise entitled. on the last day of each year (or on the date of benefit commencement, if earlier), an employee's cash balance account is credited with pay credits based on a point system of age plus service and eligible pay during the year. at the end of each calendar quarter, the account is credited with interest credits, based on an average of the 30-year treasury rates for the three months before the calendar quarter. special interest credit rules apply in the quarter in which benefit payment commences. the default forms of payment are similar to those under the final pay benefit formula. additionally, however, a cash balance participant may elect a lump-sum payout that is eligible for rollover into an individual retirement account or other tax-advantaged employer plan. cash balance participants may elect to receive their vested benefit when they leave employment with any participating employer, regardless of whether they have attained age 55. no current neos elected to switch to the cash balance benefit.
44
table of contents pg&e corporation's non-qualified serp provides benefits to certain officers and key employees. the serp benefit formula is 1.7 percent of the average of the three highest combined salary and annual stip payments during the last
10 years of service, multiplied by years of credited service. payments are in the form of a single-life annuity or, at the election of the officer, a joint spousal annuity. normal retirement age is 65. benefits may begin earlier, on the later of the neo's reaching age 55 or separation from the company, subject to reduction depending on years of credited service, in accordance with the retirement plan's early retirement reduction factors. payments are reduced by amounts payable from the retirement plan.
effective january 1, 2013, serp participation was closed to new participants. individuals who do not participate in the serp but who are newly hired or promoted to officer after january 1, 2013 may be eligible to participate in the
2013 pg&e corporation defined contribution executive supplemental retirement plan ("dc-esrp"), a non-tax-qualified deferred compensation plan. messrs. hogan and thomason participate in the dc-esrp. see the table entitled "non-
qualified deferred compensation-2018" under this item 11 and the accompanying narrative for additional dc-esrp details.
at december 31, 2018, ms. williams was eligible for early retirement under the retirement plan and the serp. if ms.
williams had retired on december 31, 2018, her benefit under both plans would have been subject to an early retirement reduction of 22.75 percent. mr. stavropoulos' benefits under both plans were subject to a 13.5 percent reduction when his employment ended.

the table presents balances from both the pg&e corporation supplemental retirement savings plan for deferrals made prior to january 1, 2005 and the pg&e corporation 2005 supplemental retirement savings plan (together, the "srsp plans") for deferrals made on and after january 1, 2005 and from the pg&e corporation defined contribution executive supplemental retirement plan ("dc-esrp"). the below descriptions pertain to 2018.
under the srsp plans, officers may defer 5 percent to 75 percent of their base salary, and all or part of their perquisite allowance, stip payment, and performance share award if settled in cash.
pg&e corporation also will contribute an amount equal to any employer contributions due under the 401(k) plan that were not made due to limitations under internal revenue code sections 401(m), 401(a)(17), or 415. under the srsp plans, officers may elect deferrals to be distributed in 1 to 10 installments commencing in january of the year following termination of employment. for deferrals made in 2005 and thereafter, distributions may commence seven months after termination of employment or in january of a year specified by the officer. earlier distributions may be made in the case of an officer's death. the plan administrator may, in its discretion, permit earlier withdrawals as requested by participants to meet unforeseen emergencies.
under the dc-esrp, each time salary or stip is paid, pg&e corporation credits the participant's account with an amount equal to 7 percent of the payment. benefits vest after three years of cumulative service with the companies, and benefits are paid in a single lump sum upon the officer's separation from service commencing as soon as reasonably practicable, following a date seven months after the separation from service. officers may also elect deferrals to be distributed in 2 to 10 equal annual installments. earlier distributions may be made in the case of an officer's death.

other available measures are the pg&e corporation phantom stock fund, which mirrors an investment in pg&e corporation common stock (2018 return of negative 45.7 percent), and the aa utility bond fund. the aa utility bond fund accrues interest based on the long-term corporate bond yield average for aa utilities reported by moody's investors service (yields reported during 2018 ranged from 3.6 percent to 4.4 percent). pre-2005 deferrals under the srsp plans are limited to the large company stock index fund, the pg&e corporation phantom stock fund, and the aa utility bond fund. in general, the earnings measures are selected by the officer and may be reallocated subject to restrictions imposed by regulations of the sec. however, deferrals of special incentive stock ownership premiums received under the prior executive stock ownership program before december 31, 2012 may only be invested in the pg&e corporation phantom stock fund and may not be reallocated.

table of contents xi. potential payments upon resignation, retirement, termination, change in control, death, or disability the neos are eligible to receive certain benefits upon termination, or when a change in control (as defined in the officer severance policy) occurs and either (1) the officer's employment is terminated (including constructive termination by the officer for good reason) in connection with the change in control, or (2) the acquiring company does not continue or assume outstanding ltip awards, or substitute the ltip awards with substantially equivalent awards.
the following table estimates potential payments for each neo as if, effective december 31, 2018, that individual's employment was terminated or an acquiror did not assume, continue, or grant substitute awards for ltip awards previously granted by pg&e corporation or the utility. estimates assume that the value of any stock-based compensation received was $23.75 per share, which was the closing price of pg&e corporation common stock on december 31, 2018. the table generally excludes (1) payments for services already rendered (such as unpaid and earned salary), which would be due to the neo even if the individual had remained employed with the companies, (2)
post-retirement benefits that would be available to employees generally, and (3) any deferred compensation that was previously earned but would become payable due to the termination (these deferred amounts are reflected in the table entitled "non-qualified deferred compensation-2018"). the table also does not fully take into account changes and restrictions that apply following the commencement of the chapter 11 cases on january 29, 2019. please see section 5 of the cd&a for a discussion of the potential future impacts of the chapter 11 cases.
the value of actual cash and equity received on or shortly after december 31, 2018 would be less than the "total"
amount listed below because (1) pension benefits are paid over time in the form of a life annuity, and (2) stock awards reflected in the table will be payable only after vesting, which may occur in subsequent years.
since mr. stavropoulos retired on october 1, 2018, only payments that he received upon retirement are shown.

payments made in connection with a change in control may require shareholder approval, pursuant to the pg&e corporation golden parachute
(1)  restriction policy, discussed below. if excise taxes are levied in connection with internal revenue code section 4999, the aggregate benefits shown may be reduced to a level that does not trigger the excise tax, but only if doing so would be more beneficial to the officer on an after-tax basis.
for pension payments, the number reflects the value of aggregated benefits upon termination due to death.
(2)  pension payments upon termination due to disability would be the same as in the event of resignation.
reflects the value of outstanding equity awards for which vesting is continued or accelerated due to the termination event. based on performance through december 31, 2018, no payments would be made with respect to outstanding performance shares using

table of contents pension benefits in general if any neo is terminated for any reason, that officer generally is entitled to receive accrued and vested pension benefits, as described in the narrative accompanying the "pension benefits-2018" table. the value of the pension benefit will be paid out over time in the form of an annuity, consistent with payment elections made by the neo.
the qualified plan trust is funded by contributions from both pg&e corporation and the utility. payments from the non-qualified plan are paid by pg&e corporation and are reduced by any benefit payable from the qualified plan.
the value of pension benefits reported in the table above is identical in all termination scenarios, except if an neo's employment is terminated due to that officer's death. in that case, if (1) the officer was at least 55 years of age, or (2) the combined total of his or her age and the number of years worked exceeded 70, then the officer's surviving spouse or beneficiary would be entitled to an immediate commencement of payment of 50 percent of the single-life pension benefit that would otherwise have been available to the officer at age 65. for all other officers, the value of this pre-retirement survivor's benefit would be 50 percent of the single life pension benefit that would otherwise have been available to the officer at age 55, and the benefit would commence on the first of the month after the day that officer would have reached age 55.
officer severance policy the officer severance policy provides for severance payments and the treatment of certain ltip awards upon termination with cause, termination without cause, and termination in connection with a change in control. benefits under the officer severance policy are paid by the individual's former employer.
potential payments - resignation/retirement ltip awards unvested performance shares, stock options, and rsus generally are cancelled upon resignation, unless that individual's resignation qualifies as a "retirement." for these purposes, "retirement" for the neos means a termination of employment, other than for cause, when an employee is at least 55 years old and has been employed for at least the last five consecutive years immediately before termination. if the individual "retires," then:
●  unvested performance shares continue to vest and will become payable as if the officer remained employed, unvested annual rsu awards continue to vest and will become payable as if the officer remained employed
●  (unless retirement occurs within two years following a change in control, in which case shares underlying the rsus vest and are paid out within 60 days following the retirement).
unvested annual stock options continue to vest and will become exercisable according to their normal vesting
●  schedule as if the officer remained employed (unless retirement occurs within two years following a change in control, in which case all options vest and may be exercised for the shorter of the remaining term or five years.
with respect to the rsus granted as a promotional award to mr. stavropoulos in may 2017, the retirement provision does not apply and unvested rsus were cancelled at the time his employment ended.
ms. williams was the only neo eligible for retirement under the ltip as of december 31, 2018. mr. stavropoulos was retirement-eligible at the time his employment ended.
stip if an neo resigns or retires on or after december 31 of a performance year, that officer will be entitled to receive a lump-sum stip payment for that calendar year.
50
table of contents if an neo resigns prior to december 31 of any calendar year, potential stip payments for that year generally are forfeited. however, if the neo is at least 55 years of age at the time of resignation, then potential stip payments will be treated in the same manner as for a "retirement."
if an neo retires before december 31 of any calendar year, then the compensation committee may, in its discretion, approve providing the retired neo with a lump-sum stip payment for that calendar year. any such stip payment generally would reflect actual earnings, and thus be prorated to reflect the amount of time that the retired neo was employed during the performance period.
any stip payment generally would reflect the stip performance score applicable to active employees and would be paid by the former employer at the same time as for active employees.
post-retirement life insurance benefits upon retirement (as defined under the qualified pension plan), all employees of pg&e corporation, the utility, and certain subsidiaries are eligible to receive a life insurance coverage benefit under the post-retirement life insurance plan of pacific gas and electric company. if an employee retires at age 55 or older with at least 15
years of service ("qualifying retirement") with the companies and their respective subsidiaries, the employee may qualify for a different "benefit level" and the value of the benefit may increase. each retiree's applicable
"benefit level" is determined based on factors such as the participant's position with the company at retirement and the date of hire or promotion. prior to december 31, 2008, upon qualifying retirement, certain benefit levels also permitted the retiree to elect to receive the benefit in the form of a lump-sum cash payment equal to the present value of the insurance coverage benefit. participants no longer may elect the cash payment upon retirement, but certain individuals who were employees as of december 31, 2008 and who were likely upon retirement to qualify for the benefit levels that previously offered the cash alternative were given the opportunity to make a one-time election as to whether to receive future benefits (if any) as insurance coverage or in the form of a lump-sum cash payment. benefits are paid by the former employer.
upon qualifying retirement, ms. williams and mr. simon would receive a lump-sum cash benefit equal to the present value of a post-retirement life insurance policy with coverage equal to his or her last 12 months of salary. upon qualifying for retirement, all other neos would be entitled to receive a life insurance benefit in the amount of
$50,000.
potential payments - termination for cause if an officer is terminated for cause, all outstanding performance shares and rsus are cancelled, stock options are forfeited, no severance payment is available, and the officer is not eligible to receive a stip payment for that year.
as provided in the officer severance policy, in general, an officer is terminated "for cause" if the employer determines in good faith that the officer has engaged in, committed, or is responsible for:
●  serious misconduct, gross negligence, theft, or fraud against pg&e corporation and/or the officer's employer,
●  refusal or unwillingness to perform his or her duties,
●  inappropriate conduct in violation of the corporation's equal employment opportunity policy, conduct that reflects adversely upon, or making any remarks disparaging of, the corporation, its board,
●  officers, or employees, or its affiliates or subsidiaries,
●  insubordination, any willful act that is likely to injure the reputation, business, or business relationship of the
●  corporation or its subsidiaries or affiliates, or
●  violation of any fiduciary duty, or breach of any duty of loyalty.
51
table of contents with respect to vesting of ltip awards, "cause" generally is determined in the sole discretion of pg&e corporation, and typically includes dishonesty, a criminal offense, or violation of a work rule.
potential payments - termination without cause ltip awards termination provisions are described in the officer severance policy and ltip award agreements.
unvested performance shares generally vest based on actual performance proportionately based on the number
●  of months during the performance period that the officer was employed divided by 36 months. any vested performance shares are settled, if at all, at the end of the applicable performance period.
●  unvested rsus generally continue to vest for 12 months.
unvested stock options that would have vested over the 12 months following termination will continue to
●  vest. vested stock options may be exercised for the shorter of one year or the remaining term.
however, if the officer is at least 55 years of age with at least five years of service, his or her termination without cause is treated as a retirement under the terms of the ltip. (please see the section entitled "potential payments-resignation/ retirement" for a discussion of vesting provisions.) ms. williams was the only neo eligible for retirement under the ltip as of december 31, 2018. mr. stavropoulos was retirement-eligible at the time his employment ended.
severance payment all neos would be entitled to a lump-sum payment of one times annual base salary and stip target.
stip if an officer is terminated without cause before december 31 of a given year and has at least six months of service in that year, the officer is eligible to receive a prorated lump-sum stip award for that year. such stip payment generally would reflect the stip performance score applicable to active employees and would be prorated to reflect the amount of time that the officer was employed during the performance period. payments would be paid by the former employer and at the same time as for active employees.
miscellaneous benefits the officer is entitled to receive a lump-sum cash payment equal to the estimated value of 18 months of cobra premiums, based on the officer's benefit levels at the time of termination (with such payment subject to taxation under applicable law), and career transition services.
covenants in consideration for severance benefits other than those relating to ltip awards, (1) the officer agrees not to divulge any confidential or privileged information obtained during his or her employment, unless required or permitted by law, (2) during a period of 12 months following severance, the officer agrees to a covenant to, among other things, refrain from soliciting customers and employees, (3) the officer agrees to assist in legal proceedings as reasonably required during this period, (4) the officer must sign a release of claims, and (5) the officer must agree not to compete with the companies to the extent permitted by law.
potential payments - severance in connection with change in control change-in-control benefits require a "double trigger" and are not payable based on a change-in-control event alone.
benefits in connection with a change in control are provided by the officer severance policy, the ltips, and related ltip award agreements and guidelines. benefits may be limited by the pg&e corporation golden parachute restriction policy, which is discussed further below.
52
table of contents definition of change in control a change in control occurs upon any of the following events:
any person or entity (excluding employee benefit plans or a plan fiduciary) becomes the direct or indirect owner of more than 30 percent of pg&e corporation's outstanding common stock.
over any two-year period, a majority of the pg&e corporation directors in office at the beginning of the period are no longer in office (unless each new director was elected or nominated for shareholder election by at least two-thirds of the remaining active directors who also were in office at the beginning of the period or who were elected or nominated by
1.  at least two-thirds of the
2.  active directors at the time of election or nomination).
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
following any shareholder-approved consolidation or merger of pg&e corporation, the former corporation
3.  shareholders own less than 70 percent of the voting power in the surviving entity (or parent of the surviving entity).
(a) consummation of the sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer of all or substantially all of pg&e
4.  corporation's assets, or
(b) shareholder approval of a plan of liquidation or dissolution of pg&e corporation.
ltip awards following a change in control, ltip awards generally accelerate or automatically vest if either (a) the successor company fails to assume, continue, or substitute previously granted awards in a manner that preserves the value of those awards, or (b) the award recipient is terminated (including constructive termination) in connection with a change in control during a set period of time before or after the change in control. specific acceleration, vesting, and settlement provisions are as follows (subject to any delays necessary to comply with internal revenue code section 409a):

simon. mr. stavropoulos was a covered officer prior to the end of his employment. if mr. soto, mr. hogan, or mr.
thomason had been terminated in connection with a change in control as of december 31, 2018, each would have been eligible for standard severance benefits, as discussed in the section entitled "potential payments-termination without cause."
53
table of contents if a covered officer is terminated without cause or is constructively terminated in connection with a change in control (which includes termination prior to a potential change in control, as defined in the officer severance policy), the officer generally would be eligible for a lump-sum payment equal to the total of:
1.  unpaid base salary earned through the termination date,
2.  any accrued but unpaid vacation pay, and two times the sum of (a) target stip for the fiscal year in which termination occurs, and (b) the officer's
3.  annual base salary in effect immediately before either the date of termination or the change in control, whichever is greater.
however, in connection with the elimination of reimbursement payments for excise taxes levied in connection with internal revenue code section 4999, eligible officers either (1) are responsible for paying any such excise taxes, or (2) have their aggregate change-in-control benefits reduced to a level that does not trigger the excise tax, but only if doing so would be more beneficial to the officer on an after-tax basis.
for these purposes, "cause" means:
the covered officer's willful and continued failure to substantially perform the officer's duties with
(i)   pg&e corporation or one of its affiliates, after a written board demand for substantial performance is delivered to the officer, or
(ii)  the willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially injurious to pg&e corporation.
constructive termination includes resignation in connection with conditions that constitute good reason as defined in the officer severance policy (which includes, among other things, a material diminution in duties, authority, or base compensation).
stip if a covered officer is terminated without cause or is constructively terminated in connection with a change in control, the officer severance policy provides that the officer will receive a lump-sum payment equal to the officer's prorated target stip calculated for the fiscal year in which termination occurs. if mr. soto, mr. hogan, or mr. thomason had been terminated in connection with a change in control as of december 31, 2018, each would have been eligible for stip payments, consistent with the discussion in the section entitled "potential payments-termination without cause."
pg&e corporation golden parachute restriction policy the golden parachute restriction policy requires shareholder approval of executive severance payments provided in connection with any change in control, to the extent that those payments exceed 2.99 times the sum of a covered officer's base salary and target annual bonus. this policy was adopted by the pg&e corporation board in february
2006.
the policy applies to the value of cash, special benefits, or perquisites that are due to the executive following or in connection with both (1) a change in control, and (2) the termination or constructive termination of an officer of pg&e corporation, the utility, or their respective subsidiaries at the level of senior vice president or higher. it does not apply to the value of benefits that would be triggered by a change in control without severance, or to the value of benefits that would be triggered by severance in the absence of a change in control.
the golden parachute restriction policy also does not apply to certain enumerated payments, including, among others, compensation for services rendered prior to termination, tax restoration payments, and accelerated vesting or settlement of equity awards.
54
table of contents potential payments - termination due to death or disability ltip awards if an officer's employment is terminated due to death or disability, ltip awards are treated as follows:
unvested performance shares vest immediately. vested shares are payable, if at all, as soon as practicable
●  after completion of the performance period relevant to the performance shares.
if a participant's death or disability (as defined under internal revenue code section 409a) occurs while
●  employed, unvested rsus vest immediately and will be settled within 60 days.
if a participant's death or disability (as defined under internal revenue code section 409a) occurs while
●  employed, unvested stock options vest immediately. vested stock options may be exercised within the shorter of one year or the remaining term.
vested ltip awards are payable to the officer's designated beneficiary(ies) in the case of death, or otherwise in accordance with the officer's instructions or by law.
stip if an officer's employment is terminated due to death or disability before december 31 of the stip performance year, a prorated portion of the target stip award will become payable to the officer, or, in the case of death, to the officer's beneficiary(ies), by the former employer and at the same time as stip payments are made to active employees.

table of contents xii. principal executive officers' pay ratio - 2018
the pg&e corporation peo's 2018 total compensation was $9,289,842. the total compensation of the median employee was $177,765. the ratio of peo pay to median worker pay for pg&e corporation was 52:1.
the utility peo's 2018 total compensation was $1,727,251. the total compensation of the median employee was
$177,765. the ratio of peo pay to median worker pay for the utility was 10:1.
december 31, 2018 was selected as the date to identify the "median employee." the companies identified the same individual as was identified as the "median employee" on december 31, 2017, for purposes of disclosures in the 2017
joint proxy statement, given that since december 31, 2017, there have been no changes to either company's employee population or employee compensation arrangements that would result in significant changes to the pay ratio disclosure. to identify the "median employee" on december 31, 2017, medicare wages from tax records were utilized to make the initial identification. at that time, of the companies' total of 23,361 employees, an insignificant number (24) were employed by pg&e corporation, so the same employee was used as the "median employee" for both pg&e corporation and the utility in 2017 and again in 2018. after identifying the median employee, all the elements of compensation, including cash compensation and change in pension value, for 2018 were combined in accordance with the requirements of item 402(c)(2)(x) of sec regulation s-k.
as of december 31, 2018, three individuals concurrently served as peos of the utility: jesus soto, senior vice president, gas operations; steven malnight, senior vice president, energy supply and policy; and patrick hogan, senior vice president, electric operations. to reflect this structure, peo compensation was calculated as the average compensation provided to messrs. soto, malnight, and hogan. because these three individuals assumed the shared duties of peo on september 1, 2018, peo compensation, specifically salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation, was annualized to project the amount of compensation that would have been earned if each of the peos had been in his position for the full year.
these ratios are reasonable estimates calculated in a manner consistent with item 402(u) of regulation s-k.

related party transactions approval policies the boards of pg&e corporation and the utility each adopted a written policy (the companies' related party transaction policy ("policy")) which generally requires audit committee approval or ratification of transactions that would require disclosure under item 404(a) of regulation s-k under the securities exchange act of 1934 ("item
404(a)"), except that the policy has a lower dollar threshold than item 404(a).
under the policy, at the first meeting of each year, each company's audit committee reviews, approves, and/or ratifies related party transactions (other than the types of transactions that are excluded from disclosure under item 404(a), as described below) with values exceeding $10,000 in which either company participates and in which any "related party" has a material direct or indirect interest. for these purposes, "related party" generally includes (1) any director, nominee for director, or executive officer, (2) holders of greater than 5 percent of that company's voting securities, and (3) those parties' immediate family members.
after the annual review and approval of related party transactions, if either company wishes to enter into a new related party transaction, then that transaction must be either pre-approved or ratified by the applicable audit committee. if a transaction is not ratified in accordance with the policy, management will make all reasonable efforts to cancel or annul that transaction.
where it is not practical or desirable to wait until the next audit committee meeting to obtain approval or ratification, the chair of the applicable audit committee may elect to approve a particular related party transaction. if the chair of the applicable audit committee has an interest in the proposed related party transaction, then that transaction may be reviewed and approved by another independent and disinterested member of the applicable audit committee. in either case, the individual approving the transaction must report such approval to the full committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting.
when reviewing any related party transaction, the audit committees consider whether the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm's-length dealings with an unrelated third party. the policy also requires that each audit committee disclose to the respective board any material related party transactions.
as provided in item 404(a), the following types of transactions are excluded:
●  transactions where the rates or charges are determined by competitive bids, transactions for the rendering of services as a common or contract carrier, or public utility, at rates or
●  charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, transactions for services as a bank depository of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust
●  indenture, or similar services,
●  benefits received on a pro rata basis by holders of pg&e corporation or utility securities, transactions where the individual's interest arises solely (1) from such person's position as a director of another corporation or organization which is a party to the transaction, (2) from the direct or indirect ownership
●  of such person and a specific group (consisting of directors, nominees for director, and executive officers of the corporation, or any member of their immediate families), in the aggregate, of less than a 10 percent equity interest in another person (other than a partnership) that is a party to the transaction, or (3) from both such position and ownership, transactions where the individual's interest arises solely from the holding of an equity interest (including a limited
●  partnership interest, but excluding a general partnership interest) or a creditor interest in another person that is party to the transaction with pg&e corporation, the utility, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, and the transaction is not material to such other person, transactions where the individual's interest arises only from such person's position as a limited partner in a
●  partnership engaged in a transaction with pg&e corporation or the utility, in which the individual's interest (when aggregated with any other related parties) is less than 10 percent and the individual does not serve as a general partner of, nor hold another position in, the partnership, an employment relationship or transaction involving an executive officer of the respective company (and any
●  related compensation resulting solely from that relationship or transaction), if the compensation is reported pursuant to regulation s-k, item 402,
60
table of contents an employment relationship or transaction involving an executive officer of the respective company (and any related compensation resulting solely from that relationship or transaction), if the compensation would have been reported pursuant to regulation s-k, item 402 as compensation earned for services if that individual were an
●  executive officer named in the summary compensation table, and such compensation had been approved or recommended to the board by the pg&e corporation compensation committee (and the executive officer is not an immediate family member of another related party), or compensation provided to a director, provided that such compensation is reported pursuant to regulation s-k,
●  item
407.
since january 1, 2018, all related party transactions have been approved or ratified by the applicable audit committee in accordance with this policy.
related person transactions since january 1, 2018, one provider of asset management services in excess of $120,000 has been beneficial owner of at least 5 percent of pg&e corporation common stock: the vanguard group, inc. ("vanguard"). vanguard (including its affiliates), provided asset management services to grantor trusts associated with certain of the companies' non-
qualified and deferred income benefit plans, and to the pg&e corporation foundation. in exchange for these services, vanguard earned approximately $143,000 in fees during 2018. the services were (1) approved by the pg&e corporation audit committee, and (2) subject to terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm's-length dealings with an unrelated third party. pg&e corporation expects that vanguard will continue to provide similar services and products in the future, at similar levels, in the normal course of business operations.
kathy thomason is employed by the utility as a business finance analyst, expert, and she is the spouse of david s.
thomason, who is vice president, chief financial officer, and controller of the utility. since january 1, 2018, ms.
thomason received compensation and related payments and benefits from the utility with a value of approximately
$120,000. any payments to ms. thomason for services rendered during 2019 are expected to be similar in nature and value to payments provided during 2018, consistent with the utility's policies and practices that apply to employee compensation generally.
director independence on both pg&e corporation's board and the utility's board, at least 75 percent of the directors are independent, as required by each company's guidelines. the definitions of "independence" are identical for each company, are set forth in each company's guidelines, and reflect applicable nyse definitions.
as of april 30, 2019, all of pg&e corporation's directors also are independent as defined by the nyse. the utility board is exempt from nyse american rules requiring that at least a majority of the directors meet the stock exchange's definition of "independent director" because pg&e corporation holds approximately 96 percent of the voting power of the utility and the utility is a "controlled" subsidiary.
the boards of the corporation and the utility have determined that each of the following directors is independent according to the applicable company's guidelines: richard r. barrera, jeffrey l. bleich, nora mead brownell, frederick w. buckman, cheryl f. campbell, fred j. fowler, michael j. leffell, kenneth liang, dominique mielle, meridee a. moore, eric d. mullins, kristine m. schmidt, and alejandro d. wolff. pg&e corporation and the utility also have determined that from january 1, 2018 to the date of this amendment no. 1, each of the following past directors was independent while serving on the boards, according to the applicable company's guidelines: lewis chew, jeh c. johnson, richard c. kelly, roger h. kimmel, richard a. meserve, forrest e. miller, benito minicucci, rosendo g. parra, barbara l. rambo, and anne shen smith. (jeh c. johnson, who resigned as a director of the utility on december 7, 2017, served on the board of the corporation as of january 1, 2018 but did not stand for reelection at the corporation's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders and served through the last day of his term, may 22, 2018.
roger h. kimmel served on the boards of the corporation and the utility but resigned from both boards on january
14, 2019.)
in assessing each director's independence, the companies considered transactions between pg&e corporation or the utility and their respective directors, and their immediate family members, and certain entities with which the directors or their immediate family members were affiliated. these transactions primarily involved (a) the utility's provision of utility services at rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority and (b) membership fees paid to a non-profit entity affiliated with one of the companies' directors (in amounts below the $10,000 threshold for audit committee review pursuant to the companies' related party transaction policy), which the boards determined were not material and did not affect the director's independence.
61
table of contents each of the audit committees, the compensation committee, and the nominating and governance committee is composed entirely of independent directors, as defined in the applicable company's guidelines and the committee's charters.
in addition, the audit committees, the compensation committee, and the nominating and governance committee are composed entirely of independent directors, as required and defined by the nyse. because the utility is a
"controlled" subsidiary of pg&e corporation for purposes of the nyse american standards, the utility is not subject to nyse american rules that otherwise would require that the utility's board committees responsible for executive compensation and governance be comprised of "independent" directors, as defined by nyse american, and would impose requirements on the utility's director nomination and compensation-setting processes.
each member of the audit committees and each member of the compensation committee also satisfies heightened independence standards established by sec rules and applicable stock exchange requirements regarding independence of audit committee members and compensation committee members.

selection and oversight of the independent auditor each audit committee is responsible for the appointment, replacement, compensation, and oversight of the work of the independent auditor. the audit committees review the scope of the audit, including the terms of the engagement.
the independent auditor reports directly to the audit committees; at each audit committee meeting, the independent auditor meets separately with the audit committees, without management present.
annually, each audit committee also evaluates the independence, qualifications, and performance of the independent auditor, taking into account the opinions of management and the internal auditors. to ensure continuing independence of the independent auditor, the audit committees also consider whether there should be rotation of the independent auditor. in accordance with sec rules, the lead audit partner may provide a maximum number of five consecutive years of service to the companies. consistent with that requirement, deloitte & touche assigned a new lead auditor to lead the integrated audit of pg&e corporation's and the utility's financial statements, starting in
2017. the audit committees reviewed and evaluated the new lead auditor as part of its annual process for reviewing the independent auditor.
for 2019, the audit committees selected deloitte & touche as the companies' independent auditor, following consideration of the following factors and criteria: (1) status as a registered public accounting firm and is subject to oversight by the public company accounting oversight board; (2) status as a "big four" public accounting firm, nationally and internationally recognized as an expert in accounting and auditing; (3) having one of the largest utility practices of the "big four" public accounting firms; (4) having made a strong commitment to supporting supplier diversity; (5) having significant experience with the companies; and (6) having an experienced team, including the lead partner, familiar with the industry, assigned to the companies' engagements. the audit committees also considered (1) deloitte & touche's quality control report, (2) deloitte & touche's discussion of its independence, and (3) a review of deloitte & touche's proposed audit plan (including draft engagement letter)
for 2019.
although deloitte & touche has been the companies' independent auditor since 1999, in 2015 and at the audit committees' direction, the companies solicited bids from accounting firms to conduct the external audits of the companies' financial statements for the year ending december 31, 2016. the bids were evaluated by the auditor selection committee, which was comprised of members from the companies' accounting, internal auditing, regulatory, operational, sourcing, and legal functions. the bids were evaluated with respect to four key factors: firm capabilities and background, firm resources and audit plan, supplier diversity plans, and pricing. upon consideration of the information provided by the auditor selection committee, each audit committee appointed deloitte & touche as the independent auditor for the year ending december 31, 2016.
fees paid to the independent auditor during 2018 and 2017
the audit committees have reviewed the audit and non-audit fees that pg&e corporation, the utility, and their respective controlled subsidiaries have paid to the independent auditor (including subsidiaries and affiliates), in order to consider whether the nature and relative value of those fees are compatible with maintaining the firm's independence.

tax fees deloitte & touche and its affiliates provided no services in this category during 2018 and 2017.
all other fees deloitte & touche and its affiliates provided no services in this category during 2018 and 2017.
obtaining services from the independent auditor annual review and pre-approval of services for each fiscal year, each audit committee approves a list of services that will be obtained during that year by the applicable company and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates from the independent auditor (including its affiliates). the approved services generally are consistent with the descriptions below:
category                  description audit and review of annual and quarterly financial statements, expressing opinions on the conformity of the audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, auditing audit services            management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and services that only the independent auditor reasonably can provide
(e.g., comfort letters, statutory and regulatory audits, attest services, consents, assistance with and review of documents filed with the sec, and assistance with new accounting standards, laws, and regulations).
assurance and related services that traditionally are performed by the independent auditor (e.g., agreed-upon procedure audit-related services    reports related to contractual obligations and financing activities, consulting regarding accounting pronouncements, nuclear decommissioning trust audits, and attest services).
advice relating to compliance, tax strategy, tax appeals, and specialized tax issues, tax services              all of which also must be permitted under the sarbanes-oxley act.
non-audit services        none.
the audit committees also approve maximum fee amounts for each approved service.
as part of the review process, the audit committees assess, among other things, the impact of that service on the independent auditor's independence.
during 2018, management adopted a policy of retaining d&t, deloitte consulting, or their subsidiaries or affiliate
(together, "deloitte") for non-audit services only if the services (1) do not impair d&t's independence, in fact or appearance, and are permitted by any rules regarding auditor independence, and (2) when aggregated, total amounts paid per year by the companies to deloitte for "tax service" and "other services" (non-audit services) will be no more than 20 percent of the expected amounts that the companies will pay to deloitte for "audit services" and
"audit-related services."
64
table of contents mid-year monitoring and approval of additional services during the year, management periodically updates each audit committee as to the extent to which the approved services have already been provided. the audit committees also must approve (1) any proposed new services that were not approved during the annual review, and (2) any increase in authorized fee amounts for previously approved services.
delegation of pre-approval authority each audit committee has delegated to its committee chair, or to any other independent committee member if the chair is not available, the authority to pre-approve services provided by the applicable company's independent auditor. these pre-approvals must be presented to the full audit committee at the next regularly scheduled committee meeting.
services provided during 2018 and 2017
during 2018 and 2017, all services provided by deloitte & touche to pg&e corporation, the utility, and their consolidated affiliates were approved consistent with the applicable pre-approval procedures.

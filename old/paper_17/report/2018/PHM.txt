item 1a. risk factors discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10-k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are, or may become, subject. these risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, or prospects in a material and adverse manner.
the homebuilding industry is cyclical and a deterioration in industry conditions or downward changes in general economic or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results.
the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, and interest rate levels. adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes, either of which could result in a significant decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.
beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011, the u.s. housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to, among other factors, weak consumer confidence, tightened mortgage standards, significant foreclosure activity, a more challenging appraisal environment, higher than normal unemployment levels, and significant uncertainty in the global economy. during this period, we incurred significant losses, including impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets. since 2011, overall industry new home sales have increased, and we returned to profitability beginning in 2012. however, the recovery in housing demand has been slow by historical standards and the adjustments we have made to our operating strategy may not be successful if the current housing market were to deteriorate significantly.
future increases in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability, or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results.
a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans, many through pulte mortgage. while mortgage interest rates in recent years have been at or near historic lows, thereby making new homes more affordable, mortgage loan interest rates have increased recently as the federal funds rate has been increased. increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could adversely affect the market for new homes. potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs resulting from higher interest rates or to obtain mortgage financing. lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. even if potential customers do not need financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing. these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business. our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ. these developments have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations of our business. for example, during 2018, we experienced lower than expected conversions of traffic to signups, especially among first-time and move-up buyers, beginning in may 2018 when mortgage rates increased.
the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market. the impact of the federal government's conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the short-term and long-term demand for new housing remains unclear. any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, mortgage financing, and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans. additionally, the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes.
mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes represent significant costs of homeownership, both of which were historically generally deductible for an individual's federal and, in some cases, state income taxes. on december 22, 2017, a law commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was enacted. while the tax act lowers the tax rates applicable to many businesses and individuals, it also, among other things, (i) limits the federal deduction for mortgage interest so that it only applies to the first $750,000 of a new mortgage (as compared to $1 million under previous tax law), (ii) introduces a $10,000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, including real estate taxes, and (iii) eliminates the federal deduction for interest on certain home equity loans. the tax act also increased the standard deduction for individuals. as a result, fewer individuals are expected to itemize their income tax deductions, which would mitigate the income tax advantages associated with homeownership for those individuals. the combination of these changes could reduce home
9
ownership affordability and demand, especially in regions with higher housing prices or higher state and local income taxes. any further changes in income tax law which eliminates or reduces the income tax benefits associated with home ownership could have an adverse impact on our business.
our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices, in accordance with our land investment criteria.
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land. the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property, inflation in land prices, zoning, allowable housing density, and other regulatory requirements. should suitable lots or land become less available, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
our long-term ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build. we experience significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets. as competition for suitable land increases, and as available land is developed, the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise, and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline. any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs. we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs, which could adversely impact our revenues, earnings, and margins.
supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries.
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials. labor shortages in certain of our markets have become more acute in recent years as the supply chain adjusts to industry growth. additionally, the cost of certain building materials, especially lumber, steel, concrete, copper, and petroleum-based materials, is influenced by changes in local and global commodity prices as well as government regulation, such as government-imposed tariffs or trade restrictions on supplies such as steel and lumber. during 2018, we experienced increases in the prices of some building materials and shortages of skilled labor in some areas. increased costs or shortages of skilled labor and/or materials cause increases in construction costs and/or could cause construction delays. we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed, which may be well in advance of the construction of the home. sustained increases in construction costs may, over time, erode our margins, and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs, thereby decreasing our margins.
if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly, our profits could decrease and result in write-downs of the carrying values of land we own.
the market value of land, building lots, and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions, and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values. we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets. if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past, we may experience less than anticipated profits, and/or we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes. when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating, land option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable, at which time we may elect to forego deposits and pre-acquisition costs and terminate the agreement. in the face of adverse market conditions, we may have substantial inventory carrying costs, we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value, and/or we may have to sell land or homes at a loss. at times we have been required to record significant write-downs of the carrying value of our land inventory, and we have elected not to exercise options to purchase land, even though that required us to forfeit deposits and write-off pre-acquisition costs. for example, we incurred land-related charges totaling $99.4 million and $191.9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. although we have taken efforts to reduce our exposure to costs of that type, a certain amount of exposure is inherent in the homebuilding business. if market conditions were to deteriorate in the future, we could again be required to record significant write downs to our land inventory, which would decrease the asset values reflected on our balance sheet and materially and adversely affect our earnings and our stockholders' equity.
10
we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant.
our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses arising out of claims associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan.  to date, the significant majority of these claims made by investors against our mortgage operations relate to loans originated prior to 2009, during which inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market. we may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex corporation ("centex"), which we acquired in 2009, for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties. as of december 31, 2018, our mortgage subsidiaries were defendants in legal proceedings in which the plaintiffs are seeking indemnification for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made by the mortgage subsidiaries in the mortgage loan sale agreements and may also be subject to other similar claims for which legal proceedings had not been instituted as of december 31, 2018.
the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. given the unsettled litigation, changes in values of underlying collateral over time, and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, actual costs could differ from our current estimates. accordingly, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future.
products supplied to us and work done by subcontractors can expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business.
we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and, in some cases, to select and obtain building materials. despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures, in some cases, subcontractors may use improper construction processes or defective materials. defective products widely used by the homebuilding industry can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of homes. the cost of complying with our warranty obligations may be significant if we are unable to recover the cost of repairs from subcontractors, materials suppliers, and insurers.
we also can suffer damage to our reputation, and may be exposed to possible liability, if subcontractors fail to comply with applicable laws, including laws involving actions or matters that are not within our control. when we learn about possibly improper practices by subcontractors, we attempt to cause the subcontractors to discontinue them and may terminate the use of such subcontractors. however, attempts at mitigation may not avoid claims against us relating to actions of or matters relating to our subcontractors.
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital.
the capital and credit markets can experience significant volatility. we may need credit-related liquidity for the future development of our business and other capital needs. without sufficient liquidity, we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land, which could adversely affect our financial results. at december 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $1.1 billion as well as $760.6 million available under our revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. however, our internal sources of liquidity and revolving credit facility may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds relating to certain performance-related obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and insurance programs. the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities, other government agencies, and utility companies related to the construction of roads, sewers, and other infrastructure. at december 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling $239.4 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. these letters of credit are generally issued via our unsecured revolving credit facility, which contains certain financial covenants and other limitations. if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required, or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly, our liquidity could be adversely affected.
11
our inability to sell mortgages into the secondary market could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes unless we are willing to become a long-term investor in loans we originate.
we sell substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate within a short period in the secondary mortgage market. if we were unable to sell loans into the secondary mortgage market or directly to fannie mae and freddie mac, we would have to either (a) curtail our origination of residential mortgage loans, which among other things, could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes, or (b) commit our own funds to long term investments in mortgage loans, which, in addition to requiring us to deploy substantial amounts of our own funds, could delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations.
competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability.
the u.s. housing industry is highly competitive. homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable land, financing, raw materials, skilled management, and labor resources. we compete in each of our markets with numerous national, regional, and local homebuilders on the basis of location, price, quality, reputation, design, community amenities, and our customers' overall sales and homeownership experiences. this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volume. competition can also affect our ability to procure suitable land, raw materials, and skilled labor at acceptable prices or other terms.
we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes, housing speculators, and available rental housing.
increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes.
the loss of the services of members of our senior management or a significant number of our operating employees could negatively affect our business.
our success depends upon the skills, experience, and active participation of our senior management, many of whom have been with the company for a significant number of years. if we were to lose members of our senior management, we might not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis, and our operations could be negatively affected. also, the loss of a significant number of operating employees in key roles or geographies where we are not able to hire qualified replacements could have a material adverse effect on our business.
our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves, if any.
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal, state, and local taxes. in the ordinary course of business, there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain. our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors, including relevant facts and circumstances, applicable tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues. although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate, no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves. such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and, consequently, on our financial position, cash flows, or net income.
we are periodically audited by various federal, state, and local authorities regarding tax matters. our current audits are in various stages of completion; however, no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit, appeal, and, in some cases, litigation process. as each audit is concluded, adjustments, if any, are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined. to provide for potential tax exposures, we consider a variety of factors, including relevant facts and circumstances, applicable tax law, correspondence with taxing authorities, and effective settlement of audit issues. if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit, there could be an adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations.
we may not realize our deferred tax assets.
as of december 31, 2018, we had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $368.2 million, against which we provided a valuation allowance of $92.6 million. the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income. while we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change.
12
our ability to utilize net operating losses ("nols"), built-in losses ("bils"), and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income or income tax would be limited if we were to undergo an "ownership change" within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code (the "irc"). in general, an "ownership change" occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by "5-percent shareholders" (within the meaning of section 382 of the irc) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such "5-percent shareholders" at any time over the testing period.
an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols, bils, and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income or income tax in any single year. the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols, bils, and tax credit carryforwards. to preserve our ability to utilize nols, bils, and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation, we adopted a shareholder rights plan, which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities, and amended our by-laws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities. our shareholder rights plan, as amended, expires june 1, 2019, unless our board of directors and shareholders approve an amendment to extend the term prior thereto. notwithstanding the foregoing measures, there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382.
our ability to use certain of centex's federal losses and credits is limited under section 382 of the irc. we do not believe that the section 382 limitations will prevent us from utilizing these centex losses and credits. we do believe that full utilization of certain state nol carryforwards will be limited due to section 382.
the value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated. a decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions, especially the u.s. federal corporate tax rate, would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets, which could be material.
we have significant intangible assets. if these assets become impaired, then our profits and shareholders' equity may be reduced.
we have significant intangible assets related to business combinations. if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired, the carrying value is written down to fair value. this would result in a charge to our earnings. if management's expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur.
government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results.
our operations are subject to building, safety, environmental, and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal, state, and local governing authorities. new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, and other public improvements. these assessments have increased over recent years as other funding mechanisms have decreased causing local governing authorities to seek greater contributions from homebuilders. all of these factors can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes.
we also are subject to a variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health, safety, and the environment. the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available. these matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the cost of compliance.
our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions against discrimination, and real estate settlement procedures. they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies, pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes. for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages, we must satisfy valuation standards and site, material, and construction requirements of those agencies.
13
homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.
as a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty, construction defect, and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business. we record warranty and other reserves relating to the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built. we have, and require our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance. these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. in certain instances, we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or participate in a project-specific insurance program provided by us. policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries represent self-insurance of these risks by us. we reserve for costs to cover our self-insured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements, and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future. contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions, and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited. we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly. additionally, we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors, our insurance carriers, and our subcontractors' insurance carriers.
natural disasters, severe weather conditions and changing climate patterns could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas.
our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather. the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas. furthermore, if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected. in 2017 and 2018, several hurricanes caused disruptions in our florida, carolinas, and houston markets but did not result in a material impact to our results of operations.
in addition, government restrictions, standards, or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or potential climate change impacts are likely to result in restrictions on land development in certain areas and may increase energy, transportation, or raw material costs, which could reduce our housing gross profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations.
inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup.
inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials, and labor. in addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which may have a negative impact on demand for our homes. in an inflationary environment, economic conditions and other market factors may make it difficult for us to raise home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins. although the rate of inflation has been historically low for the last several years, we currently are experiencing increases in the prices of labor and materials above the general inflation rate.
information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business.
we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records. our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees or cyber-attacks or errors by third party vendors who have access to our confidential data, or that of our customers. while we are continuously working to improve our information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to enhance our levels of protection, to the extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches, and monitor to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have an impact on our business, there is no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new technologies, methods or other developments will detect or prevent security breaches and safeguard access to proprietary or confidential information. if our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached, or cease to function properly, or if there are intrusions or failures of critical infrastructure such as the power grid or
14
communications systems, we could suffer extended interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our employees, homebuyers and business partners). any such disruption could damage our reputation, result in market value declines, lead to legal proceedings against us by affected third parties resulting in penalties or fines, and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues.
we can be injured by improper acts of persons over whom we do not have control or by the attempt to impose liabilities or obligations of third parties on us.
although we expect all of our employees, officers, and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, there may be instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business engage in practices that do not comply with applicable laws, regulations, or governmental guidelines. when we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations, including practices relating to homes, buildings, or multifamily rental properties we build or finance, we move actively to stop the non-complying practices as soon as possible, and we have taken disciplinary action regarding employees of ours who were aware of non-complying practices and did not take steps to address them, including in some instances terminating their employment. however, regardless of the steps we take after we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations, we can in some instances be subject to fines or other governmental penalties, and our reputation can be injured, due to the practices' having taken place.
the homes we sell are built by employees of subcontractors and other contract parties. we do not have the ability to control what these contract parties pay their employees or subcontractors or the work rules they impose on their employees or subcontractors. however, various governmental agencies are trying to hold contract parties like us responsible for violations of wage and hour laws and other work-related laws by firms whose employees are performing contracted services. governmental rulings or changes in state or local laws that make us responsible for labor practices by our subcontractors could create substantial exposures for us in situations that are not within our control.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview favorable demographic and economic conditions, combined with historically low interest rates, have supported the recovery in u.s. new home sales that began in 2012. during this period, we have made significant investments to acquire and develop land inventory and open new communities, including opening approximately 250 new communities across our local markets in each of the last three years. we have grown our investment in the business in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects and working to shorten our years of owned land supply, including increasing the use of land option agreements, which now account for 40% of our controlled lots as compared with 11% at the beginning of 2012. we have also focused our land investments on closer-in locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately moderates. we have accepted the trade-off of having to pay more for certain land positions where we can be more confident in future performance. the combination of favorable demand conditions, our investments in new communities, and our focus on gross margin performance through community location, strategic pricing, and construction efficiencies resulted in growth in our revenues and income before income taxes each year during the period from 2012 to 2018.
we entered 2018 with a large backlog of new orders, and demand conditions remained favorable through the early part of 2018, as evidenced by continued growth in new orders during the traditional spring selling season. however, this was followed by an industry-wide softening in demand that began in the second quarter of 2018. to varying degrees, the slowdown has occurred across all major buyer groups and all of our geographies. this slowdown was closely correlated with the rise in mortgage interest rates that began in may 2018, however, we believe that the broader cause is the affordability challenge that many prospective buyers continue to face, which has created uncertainty in the industry regarding short-term demand. however, many of the fundamentals supporting continued growth in demand, including: a strong employment picture in the u.s.; high consumer confidence; a supportive, though slightly higher, interest rate environment; and a limited supply of new and existing homes, remain favorable.
we believe that the actions we have taken over the past few years to shorten the duration of our land inventory, increase our use of land option agreements, and drive higher margins while maintaining a conservative financial position allow us to operate effectively in most economic conditions. additionally, our overall financial condition continues to support investing in the business while returning excess capital to shareholders. if demand conditions accelerate, we have the communities and lots available to meet that demand.

•   the decrease in financial services income in 2018 compared with 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to a $16.1 million increase in loan origination liabilities in 2018 (see note 11) combined with a more competitive pricing environment. refinance activity has slowed in the mortgage industry, which has increased competition, pressured loan pricing, and resulted in lower capture rate and reduced margins on our loan originations in 2018. these factors offset higher revenues driven primarily by higher volumes in the homebuilding segment.
•   our effective tax rate was 24.2%, 52.4%, and 35.5% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively (see note 8). the effective tax rates for 2018 and 2017 reflect the impact of the tax act, which lowered the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective in 2018. due to the tax act's enactment in december 2017, income tax expense for 2017 included a charge of $172.1 million related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balances and other effects.

home sale revenues home sale revenues for 2018 were higher than 2017 by $1.5 billion, or 18%. the increase was attributable to a 10% increase in closings and an 8% increase in the average selling price. the increase in closings reflects the significant land investments we have made in recent years and the resulting growth in our active communities combined with the favorable buyer demand environment that continued into the spring of 2018. the higher average selling prices occurred across the majority of our markets and reflects shifts in product mix, including a higher mix of move-up homebuyers and an increase in the mix of closings in northern california, where our average selling prices are significantly higher than the company average.
home sale revenues for 2017 were higher than 2016 by $872.7 million, or 12%. the increase was attributable to a 6% increase in closings and a 6% increase in the average selling price. the increase in closings reflects the significant land investments we have made in recent years and the resulting increase in our active communities combined with favorable buyer demand conditions. the increased closings occurred despite the disruption in our operations caused by hurricane harvey in houston, texas, and hurricane irma in florida, as well as permitting and other municipal approval delays in certain communities. the higher average selling price for 2017 occurred across the majority of our markets and reflected a shift toward move-up homebuyers.
home sale gross margins home sale gross margins were 23.2% in 2018, compared with 22.4% in 2017 and 25.0% in 2016. our results in 2018 and 2017 include the effect of the aforementioned land inventory impairments totaling $71.0 million and $89.0 million, respectively. excluding such impairments, gross margins remained strong in both 2018 and 2017 relative to historical levels and reflect a combination of factors, including shifts in community mix and a small increase in the mix of closings in northern california in 2018 partially offset by the aforementioned warranty charge of $12.4 million in 2017 related to a closed-out community in florida and slightly higher amortized interest costs (1.8% of home sale revenues in 2018 compared with 1.7% in 2017). gross margins decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 as the result of the aforementioned land inventory impairments and warranty charge combined with higher house construction and land costs as the supply chain responded to the housing recovery.
land sales we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development. land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods, depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions. land sales contributed net gains (losses) of $37.9 million, $(72.9) million, and $12.0 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. the gains in 2018 resulted primarily from two land sale transactions in california that contributed $26.4 million. the losses in 2017 resulted primarily from the aforementioned net realizable value charges of $83.6 million (see note 2).
sg&a sg&a as a percentage of home sale revenues was 10.3% and 10.7% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. the gross dollar amount of our sg&a increased $120.4 million, or 14%, in 2018 compared with 2017. the improved overhead leverage reflects volume efficiencies and realized cost efficiencies, as well as the aforementioned insurance reserve reversals of $35.9 million and $97.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, partially offset by write-offs of $29.6 million in 2017 associated with the resolution of certain insurance matters (see note 11).
sg&a as a percentage of home sale revenues was 10.7% and 12.8% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the gross dollar amount of our sg&a decreased $65.6 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared with 2016. sg&a includes the aforementioned insurance receivable write-offs of $29.6 million in 2017 and general liability insurance reserve reversals of $97.8 million and $57.1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, resulting from favorable claims experience (see note 11). excluding these items, the improvement in our year-over-year sg&a leverage was primarily attributable to cost efficiencies realized in late 2016 that continued into 2017.

net new orders net new orders in units increased 1% in 2018 compared with 2017. the increase resulted primarily from the higher number of active communities, which increased 3% to 815 at december 31, 2018. net new orders in dollars increased by 3% compared with 2017 due to the growth in units combined with the higher average selling price. the cancellation rate (canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period) remained stable in 2018 at 14%. ending backlog units, which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed, decreased 3% as measured in units and 4% as measured in dollars at december 31, 2018 compared with december 31, 2017. the higher average sales price when compared to 2017 also contributed to the higher backlog dollars. our higher number of active communities combined with the overall demand environment resulted in a strong start to the year. however, while customer traffic to our communities increased during 2018, we experienced lower than expected conversions of traffic to signups, especially among first-time and move-up buyers, beginning in may 2018 when mortgage rates increased, which compounded existing housing affordability issues faced by many homebuyers.
net new orders in units increased 11% in 2017 compared with 2016. the increase resulted primarily from the higher number of active communities, which increased 9% to 790 active communities at december 31, 2017. net new orders in dollars increased by 21% compared with 2016 due to the growth in units combined with the higher average selling price. the cancellation rate (canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period) decreased in 2017 from 2016 at 14% and 15%, respectively. ending backlog units, which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed, increased 21% at december 31, 2017 compared with december 31, 2016 as measured in units and increased 35% over the prior year period as measured in dollars. the higher average sales price when compared to 2016 also contributed to the higher backlog dollars.

the number of homes in production at december 31, 2018 was 7% higher compared to december 31, 2017. the increase in homes under production resulted from a 24% increase in the number of unsold, or "spec", homes, which resulted primarily from the strategic decision to allow spec production to run higher than in previous periods to ensure access to construction suppliers and to position communities heading into 2019 ahead of the spring selling season.

of our controlled lots, 89,530 and 89,253 were owned and 60,047 and 52,156 were under land option agreements at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. while competition for well-positioned land is robust, we continue to pursue strategic land positions that drive appropriate returns on invested capital. the remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled $2.6 billion at december 31, 2018. these land option agreements generally may be canceled at our discretion and in certain cases extend over several years. our maximum exposure related to these land option agreements is generally limited to our deposits and pre-acquisition costs, which totaled $218.6 million, of which $11.2 million is refundable, at december 31, 2018.

northeast:
the length and complexity of the entitlement process in the northeast had led to a lack of growth in volumes in recent years, which changed in 2018 with progress in a number of communities. for 2018, northeast home sale revenues increased 15% compared with 2017 due to a 17% increase in closings, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average selling price. the higher revenues occurred across the majority of markets, which was partially offset by our exit of the st. louis market in 2018. the increased income before income taxes resulted from the higher revenues, partially offset by higher land-related charges and increased overhead expense. net new orders increased slightly.
for 2017, northeast home sale revenues remained flat compared with 2016 due to a 6% decrease in closings offset by a 6% increase in average selling price. the decrease in closings occurred in the new england and mid-atlantic markets, while the increase in average selling price occurred across all markets. the new england closings decrease was driven primarily by closings delayed as the result of a fire in an attached product building that was under construction. the decreased income before income taxes resulted from lower margins and increased sg&a expense across all markets, combined with the aforementioned land-related charges recognized in the period (see note 2). net new orders increased across all markets.
southeast:
for 2018, southeast home sale revenues increased 12% compared with 2017 due to a 3% increase in the average selling price combined with a 9% increase in closings. the increase in the average selling price occurred across all markets except georgia, while closings increased in raleigh, charlotte and coastal carolinas. income before income taxes increased primarily as a result of higher revenues and reduced land-related charges in 2018. net new orders decreased 3%, attributable to a majority of markets.
for 2017, southeast home sale revenues increased 5% compared with 2016 due to a 5% increase in the average selling price. the increases in the average selling price occurred across all markets except georgia, while closings decreased in raleigh, charlotte and coastal carolinas, offset by increases in georgia and tennessee. income before income taxes decreased 16% primarily due to the aforementioned land-related charges, partially offset by lower sg&a expense. net new orders increased 11%, primarily in georgia and raleigh.

florida:
for 2018, florida home sale revenues increased 30% compared with 2017 due to a 6% increase in the average selling price combined with a 24% increase in closings. the increased income before income taxes for 2018 resulted primarily from higher revenues combined with the aforementioned $12.4 million warranty charge in 2017 related to a closed-out community. net new orders increased 21% in 2018.
for 2017, florida home sale revenues increased 15% compared with 2016 due to a 3% increase in the average selling price combined with a 12% increase in closings. the increased income before income taxes for 2017 resulted primarily from higher revenues, partially offset by the aforementioned $12.4 million warranty charge in 2017 related to a closed-out community. net new orders increased by 15% in 2017. both closings and new orders increased despite the disruption in our operations caused by hurricane irma.
midwest:
for 2018, midwest home sale revenues increased 4% compared with the prior year period due to an 1% increase in closings combined with an 3% increase in the average selling price. the higher revenues occurred across the majority markets, partially offset by our decision to exit the st. louis market in 2017, which we completed in 2018. income before income taxes remained consistent with the prior year due to the increased revenues, partially offset by lower margins and higher sg&a expense. net new orders decreased across substantially all markets.

financial services operations we conduct our financial services operations, which include mortgage banking, title, and insurance brokerage operations, through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries. in originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds, including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties. substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination, generally within 30 days. we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans. this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time. operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations, the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding. our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production. we believe that our capture rate, which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations, excluding cash closings, is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model. the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations ($000's omitted):

revenues total financial services revenues during 2018 increased 7% compared with 2017. the increase is primarily due to higher loan origination, title, and insurance brokerage volume resulting from higher volumes in the homebuilding segment. a higher average loan size, driven primarily by higher average selling prices in the homebuilding segment, also contributed to the higher revenues. these factors were partially offset by the lower capture rate resulting from a more competitive market environment. total financial services revenues during 2017 increased 6% compared with 2016 due to higher mortgage and title volumes resulting from increased home closings in the homebuilding segment, partially offset by lower mortgage revenue per loan, which were largely attributable to increased competition and pressured loan pricing.

income before income taxes the decrease in income before income taxes for 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily due to a $16.1 million increase in loan origination liabilities in 2018 (see note 11) combined with a more competitive pricing environment. refinance activity has slowed in the mortgage industry, which has increased competition, pressured loan pricing, and resulted in lower margins on our loan originations in 2018. these factors offset higher revenues driven primarily by higher volumes in the homebuilding segment. the increased income before income taxes for 2017 as compared with 2016 resulted from higher origination volume and an increase in the revenue per loan combined with better overhead leverage and contributions from our title operations.
income taxes our effective tax rate was 24.2%, 52.4% and 35.5% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. the effective tax rates for 2018 and 2017 reflect the impact of the tax act, which lowered the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective in 2018. due to the tax act's enactment in december 2017, income tax expense for 2017 included a charge of $172.1 million related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balances and other effects. the effective tax rate for 2016 included a net benefit related to the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance related to a legal entity restructuring along with the resolution of certain state income tax and other matters.
liquidity and capital resources we finance our land acquisition, development, and construction activities and financial services operations using internally-generated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing. we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing other available financing sources, including revolving bank credit and securities offerings.
at december 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of $1.1 billion, restricted cash balances of $23.6 million, and $760.6 million available under our revolving credit facility. we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a broad portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality, highly liquid, short-term deposits and investments.
we retired outstanding debt totaling $82.8 million, $134.7 million, and $986.9 million during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization, excluding our financial services debt, was 38.6%, which is within our targeted range of 30.0% to 40.0%, at december 31, 2018.
unsecured senior notes in february 2016, we issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $300.0 million of 4.25% senior notes due march 1, 2021, and $700.0 million of 5.50% senior notes due march 1, 2026. the net proceeds from this senior notes issuance were used to fund the retirement of $465.2 million of our senior notes that matured in may 2016, with the remaining net proceeds used for general corporate purposes. in july 2016, we issued an additional $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $400.0 million of 4.25% senior notes due march 1, 2021, and $600.0 million of 5% senior notes due january 15, 2027. the net proceeds from the july senior notes issuance were used for general corporate purposes and to pay down approximately $500.0 million of outstanding debt, including the remainder of a then existing term loan facility. at december 31, 2018, we had $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding with no repayments due until march 2021 when $700.0 million of notes are scheduled to mature.
revolving credit facility in june 2018, we entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement ("revolving credit facility") which replaced the company's previous credit agreement. the revolving credit facility contains substantially similar terms to the previous credit agreement and extended the maturity date from june 2019 to june 2023. the revolving credit facility has a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion and contains an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the capacity to $1.5 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit that reduce the available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, with a sublimit of $500.0 million at december 31, 2018. the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the london interbank offered rate ("libor") or a base rate plus an applicable margin, as defined
32
therein. we had no borrowings outstanding and $239.4 million and $235.5 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum interest coverage ratio, and a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio (as each term is defined in the revolving credit facility). as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants. outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. our available and unused borrowings under the revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, amounted to $760.6 million and $764.5 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
other notes payable certain of our local homebuilding operations are party to non-recourse and limited recourse collateralized notes payable with third parties that totaled $41.3 million at december 31, 2018. these notes have maturities ranging up to three years, are secured by the applicable land positions to which they relate, have no recourse to any other assets, and are classified within notes payable.
pulte mortgage pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties. pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the loans are sold in the secondary market, which generally occurs within 30 days.
pulte mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement with third party lenders. in august 2018, pulte mortgage entered into an amended and restated repurchase agreement (the "repurchase agreement") that extended the termination date to august 2019. the maximum aggregate commitment was $520.0 million during the seasonally high borrowing period from december 26, 2018 through january 14, 2019. at all other times, the maximum aggregate commitment ranges from $240.0 million to $400.0 million. the purpose of the changes in capacity during the term of the agreement is to lower associated fees during seasonally lower volume periods of mortgage origination activity. borrowings under the repurchase agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to pulte mortgage, including quantitative thresholds related to net worth, net income, and liquidity. pulte mortgage had $348.4 million and $437.8 million outstanding under the repurchase agreement at december 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and was in compliance with its covenants and requirements as of such dates.
share repurchase program in 2013, our board of directors authorized and announced a share repurchase program, which was subsequently increased by $1.0 billion in july 2016 and by $500.0 million in january 2018. we repurchased 10.9 million, 35.4 million, and 30.9 million shares in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, for a total of $294.6 million, $910.3 million, and $600.0 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, under this program. at december 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase $299.9 million of common shares.
dividends our declared quarterly cash dividends totaled $108.5 million, $110.0 million, and $122.2 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
cash flows operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $1.4 billion, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $663.1 million and $68.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. generally, the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels and residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. our positive cash flow from operations for 2018 was primarily due to our net income of $1.0 billion, which included non-cash land-related charges of $99.4 million and $362.8 million of deferred income tax expense, supplemented by a $107.3 million reduction in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. these factors were partially offset by a net increase in inventories of $50.4 million resulting from higher levels of spec inventory.
33
our positive cash flow from operations for 2017 was primarily due to our net income of $447.2 million, which included $191.9 million in non-cash land-related charges and deferred tax expense of $422.3 million. these were partially offset by a net increase in inventories of $569.0 million resulting from ongoing land acquisition and development investment to support future growth combined with additional house inventory to support the higher backlog.
our negative cash flow from operations for 2016 was primarily due to a net increase in inventories of $897.1 million resulting from increased land investment, combined with a net increase in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale of $99.5 million.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $41.9 million in 2018, compared with $50.2 million in 2017 and $471.2 million in 2016. the use of cash from investing activities in 2018 was primarily due to $59.0 million of capital expenditures, which increased from 2017 as the result of new community openings combined with increased expenditures on information technology solutions. the use of cash from investing activities in 2017 was primarily due to $32.1 million of capital expenditures and $23.0 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries. the use of cash from investing activities in 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of certain real estate assets from wieland (see note 1).
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $580.3 million in 2018, compared with $1.0 billion during 2017 and net cash provided by financing activities of $350.7 million in 2016. the net cash used in financing activities for 2018 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 10.9 million common shares for $294.6 million under our repurchase authorization, repayments of debt of $82.8 million, cash dividends of $104.0 million, and net repayments of $89.4 million under the repurchase agreement related to the aforementioned decrease in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale.
net cash used in financing activities for 2017 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 35.4 million common shares for $910.3 million under our repurchase authorization, repayments of debt of $134.7 million, and cash dividends of $112.7 million, partially offset by net borrowings of $106.2 million under the repurchase agreement related to a seasonal increase in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. cash provided by financing activities for 2016 resulted primarily from the proceeds of the unsecured senior notes issuance for $2.0 billion, offset by the repayment of $986.9 million of debt and the repurchase of 30.9 million common shares for $600.0 million under our repurchase authorization and cash dividends of $124.7 million.
inflation we, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs. inflation may also increase our financing costs. in addition, higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers. while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices, market forces may limit our ability to do so. if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, our revenues, gross margins, and net income could be adversely affected.
seasonality although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again, we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings. this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes. as a result of the seasonality of our operations, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.

(a)   represents principal and interest payments related to our senior notes and limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements.
(b)   we do not have any payments due in connection with capital lease or long-term purchase obligations.
we are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts (including land option contracts) for the purchase, development, and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option, which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with long-term land holdings. at december 31, 2018, we had $218.6 million of deposits and pre-acquisition costs, of which $11.2 million is refundable, relating to option agreements to acquire 60,047 lots with a remaining purchase price of $2.6 billion. we expect to acquire the majority of such land within the next three years.
we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months. the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable. the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years january 1, 2005 - january 1, 2018. at december 31, 2018, we had $30.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and $5.8 million of related accrued interest and penalties.

(a)   the $1.0 billion in 2022-2023 represents the capacity of our unsecured revolving credit facility, under which no borrowings were outstanding, and $239.4 million of letters of credit were issued at december 31, 2018.
(b)   represents the capacity of the repurchase agreement, of which $348.4 million was outstanding at december 31, 2018. the capacity of $520.0 million was effective through january 14, 2019 after which it ranges from $240.0 million to $400.0 million until its expiration in august 2019.
(c)   the above table excludes an aggregate $1.3 billion of surety bonds, which typically do not have stated expiration dates.
off-balance sheet arrangements we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects. the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects. if the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year-to-year basis. at december 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit of $239.4 million. our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from
35
the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. these bonds, which approximated $1.3 billion at december 31, 2018, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years. because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties, the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed.
in the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. at december 31, 2018, these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of $2.6 billion. pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices.
at december 31, 2018, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was $42.9 million, of which $42.1 million was related to one joint venture in which we have a 50% interest. in connection with this loan, we and our joint venture partner provided customary limited recourse guaranties in which our maximum financial loss exposure is limited to our pro rata share of the debt outstanding. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
36
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. when more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements). application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. in preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due regard to materiality.
revenue recognition home sale revenues - home sale revenues and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the home are transferred to the buyer at the home closing date. little to no estimation is involved in recognizing such revenues.
land sale revenues - we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development. land sales are generally outright sales of specified land parcels with cash consideration due on the closing date, which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied. certain land sale contracts may contain unique terms that require management judgment in determining the appropriate revenue recognition, but the impact of such transactions is generally immaterial.
financial services revenues - loan origination fees, commitment fees, and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred. expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment. the determination of fair value for certain of these financial instruments requires the use of estimates and management judgment. subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur. interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing arrangements, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the sub-servicing fees are earned.
revenues associated with our title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur as each home is closed. insurance brokerage commissions relate to commissions on home and other insurance policies placed with third party carriers through various agency channels. our performance obligations for policy renewal commissions are considered satisfied upon issuance of the initial policy, and related contract assets for estimated future renewal commissions are included in other assets and totaled $30.8 million at december 31, 2018. due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the long duration of renewal policies, which can extend years into the future, actual results could differ from such estimates.
inventory and cost of revenues inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable, in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value. cost includes land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, including interest, real estate taxes, and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction. for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled, applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred. land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community. the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs.
we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. interest expense is allocated over the period based on the timing of home closings.
cost of revenues includes the construction cost, average lot cost, estimated warranty costs, and closing costs applicable to the home. sales commissions are classified within selling, general, and administrative expenses. the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs. this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. total community land acquisition and development
37
costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities. adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community's remaining lots.
we test inventory for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the community may be less than its carrying amount. such indicators include gross margins or sales paces significantly below expectations, construction costs or land development costs significantly in excess of budgeted amounts, significant delays or changes in the planned development for the community, and other known qualitative factors. communities that demonstrate potential impairment indicators are tested for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows for the community to its carrying value. for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, we determine the fair value of the community and impairment charges are recorded if the fair value of the community's inventory is less than its carrying value.
we generally determine the fair value of each community using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions, where available. these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives, expected sales paces, expected land development and construction timelines, and anticipated land development, construction, and overhead costs. the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models are specific to each community. due to uncertainties in the estimation process, the significant volatility in demand for new housing, the long life cycles of many communities, and potential changes in our strategy related to certain communities, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates.
residential mortgage loans available-for-sale in accordance with asc 825, "financial instruments" ("asc 825"), we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans available-for-sale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur.
loan origination liabilities our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. if a loan is determined to be faulty, we either indemnify the investor for potential future losses, repurchase the loan from the investor, or reimburse the investor's actual losses. estimating the required liability for these potential losses requires a significant level of management judgment. given the unsettled litigation, changes in values of underlying collateral over time, and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, actual costs could differ from our current estimates.
allowance for warranties home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects, including a one-year comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home's construction and operating systems for periods of up to (and in limited instances exceeding) 10 years. we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized. factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the projected cost of claims. we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary. actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates.
income taxes we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is "more likely than not" that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods.  we conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence. this evaluation considers, among other factors, historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for
38
the u.s. housing industry and broader economy. the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the realization of deferred tax assets over time.
unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes. we follow the provisions of asc 740, "income taxes" ("asc 740"), which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.  significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors, including relevant facts and circumstances, applicable tax law, correspondence with taxing authorities, and effective settlements of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense (benefit) in the period in which the change is made. interest and penalties related to income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense (benefit).
self-insured risks at any point in time, we are managing over 1,000 individual claims related to general liability, property, errors and omission, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage. we reserve for costs associated with such claims (including expected claims management expenses) on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and periodically evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims. the actuarial analyses calculate estimates of the ultimate cost of all unpaid losses, including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ("ibnr"). ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims.
our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled $737.0 million and $758.8 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims. the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both (i) existing claims and related claim expenses and (ii) ibnr and related claim expenses. liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 65% of the total general liability reserves at december 31, 2018 and 2017. the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors, including the frequency and severity of losses, which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data. the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses. because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims, actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs. based on the actuarial analyses performed, we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is $625 million to $850 million. while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims, due to a variety of factors, including those factors described above, there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range.
housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years, and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. additionally, ibnr estimates comprise the majority of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns, third party recoveries, insurance industry practices, the regulatory environment, and legal precedent. state regulations vary, but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years. changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses, which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves. additionally, the amount of insurance coverage available for each policy period also impacts our recorded reserves. because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses and the timing of such losses related to these claims, actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs.
adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. during 2018, 2017, and 2016, we reduced general liability reserves by $35.9 million, $97.8 million, and $57.1 million, respectively, as a result of changes in estimates resulting from actual claim experience observed being less than anticipated in previous actuarial projections. the changes in actuarial estimates were driven by changes in actual claims experience that, in turn, impacted actuarial estimates for potential future claims. these changes in actuarial estimates did not involve any changes in actuarial methodology but did impact the development of estimates for future periods, which resulted in adjustments to the ibnr portion of our recorded liabilities.
in certain instances, we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from subcontractors or other third parties. estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable. our receivables from insurance carriers totaled $153.0 million and $213.4 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the

insurance receivables relate to costs incurred or to be incurred to perform corrective repairs, settle claims with customers, and other costs related to the continued progression of both known and anticipated future construction defect claims that we believe to be insured related to previously closed homes. we believe collection of these insurance receivables is probable based on various factors, including, the legal merits of our positions after review by legal counsel, favorable legal rulings received to date, the credit quality of our carriers, and our long history of collecting significant amounts of insurance reimbursements under similar insurance policies related to similar claims, including significant amounts funded by the above carriers under different policies.
while the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

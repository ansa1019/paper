item 1a. risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this form 10-k. additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations, including those discussed in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10-k. if any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be materially different, than we presently anticipate. the categories of risk we have identified in item 1a.-risk factors of this form 10-k include the following:
•   risks related to our indebtedness and financial condition;
•   external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility;
•   risks associated with our operations; and
•   risks associated with governmental regulation and laws.
these risk factors should be read in conjunction with item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
risks related to our indebtedness and financial condition we have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, that could adversely affect our business and our ability to fulfill our obligations.
as of december 31, 2018, we had approximately $19 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. all outstanding borrowings, if any, under the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility and secured term loan are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capital stock of many of the aes corporation's directly held subsidiaries. most of the debt of the aes corporation's subsidiaries is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. since we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on this debt. furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured assets. this high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors, including:
•   making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and/or individual subsidiaries;
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices;
•   reducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and
•   limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.
the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. if we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. accordingly, our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. in addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our debt could come at higher interest rates or may require us to comply with onerous covenants, which could restrict our business operations. see note 10.-debt included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for a schedule of our debt maturities.
the aes corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.
the aes corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. almost all of the aes corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. therefore, the aes corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.
however, our subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to the aes corporation. most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions to the aes corporation. business performance and local accounting and tax rules may also limit dividend distributions. subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to the aes corporation as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies.
the aes corporation's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of the aes corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments.
existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect the aes corporation.
we attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents that, except as noted below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. this type of financing is usually referred to as non-recourse debt or "non-recourse financing." in some non-recourse financings, the aes corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. these obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties.
as of december 31, 2018, we had approximately $19.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $3.7 billion was recourse debt of the aes corporation and approximately $15.6 billion was non-recourse debt. in addition, we have outstanding guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other credit support commitments which are further described in this form 10-k in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-capital resources and liquidity-parent company liquidity.
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. the total debt classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was $351 million as of december 31, 2018. while the lenders under our non-recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to the aes corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by the aes corporation), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for the aes corporation, including, without limitation:
•   reducing the aes corporation's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the aes corporation during the pendency of any default;
•   under certain circumstances, triggering the aes corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support which the aes corporation may have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
•   triggering defaults in the aes corporation's outstanding debt. for example, the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility, secured term loan, and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. in addition, the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding material debt of material subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary; or
•   foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse loans, resulting in write-downs of assets and eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets.
none of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate meet the applicable standard of materiality in the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. however, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility or other indebtedness of the aes corporation.
the aes corporation, or the parent company, has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.
the aes corporation requires cash primarily to fund:
•   principal repayments of debt;
•   interest;
•   acquisitions;
•   construction and other project commitments;
•   other equity commitments, including business development investments;
•   equity repurchases and/or cash dividends on our common stock;
•   taxes; and
•   parent company overhead costs.
the aes corporation's principal sources of liquidity are:
•   dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries;
•   proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level; and
•   proceeds from asset sales.
for a more detailed discussion of the aes corporation's cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-capital resources and liquidity in this form 10-k.
while we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the parent company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, which could prove incorrect, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions. there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. in addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding under our credit facility, term loan, and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us.
our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to raise capital on favorable terms.
from time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•   general economic and capital market conditions;
•   the availability of bank credit;
•   the financial condition, performance and prospects of the aes corporation in general and/or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing;
•   the financial condition, performance and prospects of other companies in our industry or with similar financial circumstances; and
•   changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital.
should access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants, or expand or improve existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or financial condition.
a downgrade in the credit ratings of the aes corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our access to the capital markets, increase our interest costs and/or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.
if any of the credit ratings of the aes corporation or its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs could increase. furthermore, depending on the aes corporation's credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by the aes corporation to provide credit support. accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the aes corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by the aes corporation. there can be no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guarantees or that aes could arrange such further assurances in the future. in addition, to the extent the aes corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to the aes corporation to meet its other liquidity needs.
we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund development projects in certain less developed economies, which could affect our growth strategy.
part of our strategy is to grow our business by developing businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may be greater than projects in more developed economies. commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non-recourse project financing in certain less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and may continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. as a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereign-related risks. there can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the relevant project or invest more of our own funds, which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects.
external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets.
some of our businesses sell electricity in the spot markets when they operate at levels in excess of their power sales agreements or retail load obligations or when they do not have any powers sales agreements. our businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. as a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets. the open market wholesale prices for electricity can be volatile and generally reflect the variable cost of the source generation which could include renewable sources at near zero pricing or thermal sources subject to fluctuating cost of fuels such as coal, natural gas or oil derivative fuels in addition to other factors described below. consequently, any changes in the generation supply stack and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity.
volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from, among other things:
•   plant availability in the markets generally;
•   availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;
•   competition;
•   seasonality;
•   hydrology and other weather conditions;
•   illiquid markets;
•   transmission,transportation constraints, inefficiencies and/or availability;
•   renewables source contribution to the supply stack;
•   new entrants;
•   increased adoption of distributed generation;
•   energy efficiency and demand side resources;
•   available supplies of coal, natural gas, and crude oil and refined products;
•   generating unit performance;
•   natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events;
•   energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;
•   general economic conditions globally as well as in areas where we operate that impact demand and energy consumption; and
•   bidding behavior and market bidding rules.
adverse economic developments in china could have a negative impact on demand for electricity in many of our markets.
the chinese market has been driving global materials demand and pricing for commodities over the past decade. many of these commodities are produced in areas that are also our key markets for the sale of electricity. after experiencing rapid growth for more than a decade, china's economy has experienced decreasing foreign and domestic demand, weak investment, factory overcapacity and oversupply in the property market, and has experienced a significant slowdown in recent years. u.s. tariffs are also expected to have a negative impact on china's economic growth. continued slowing in china's economic growth, demand for commodities and/or material changes in policy could result in lower economic growth and lower demand for electricity in our key markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations.
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. while the consolidated financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars, the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries outside the united states are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into u.s. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. as a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the united states report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. in addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. our financial position and results of operations could be affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies.
wholesale power prices are declining in many markets and this could have a material adverse effect on our operations and opportunities for future growth.
the wholesale prices offered for electricity have declined significantly in recent years in many markets in which the company has businesses. this price decline is due to a variety of factors, including the increased penetration of renewable generation resources, low-priced natural gas and demand side management. the levelized cost of electricity from new solar and wind generation sources has dropped substantially in recent years as solar panel costs and wind turbine costs have declined, while wind and solar capacity factors have increased. these renewable resources have no fuel costs and very low operational costs. in many instances, energy from these facilities are bid into the wholesale spot market at a price of zero or close to zero during certain times of the day, driving down the clearing price for all generators selling power in the relevant spot market. also, in many markets new ppas have been awarded for renewable generation at prices significantly lower than the prices being awarded just a few years ago.
this trend of declining wholesale prices could continue and could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our existing generation assets to the extent they currently sell power into the spot market or will seek to sell power into the spot market once their ppas expire. the trend of declining prices can also make it more difficult for us to obtain attractive prices under new long-term ppas for any new generation facilities we may seek to develop. as a result, the trend can have an adverse impact on our opportunities for new investments.
we may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.
we routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. as part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. we also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. however, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. in particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. as a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. in addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under u.s. gaap, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. the company may also suffer losses associated with "basis risk," which is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the underlying exposure (usually the pricing node of the generation facility). furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements, while we seek to protect against that by utilizing strong credit requirements and exchange trades, these protections may not fully cover the exposure in the event of a counterparty default.
for our businesses with ppa pricing that does not completely pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.
supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the company to significant financial credit or performance risks.
we often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of some of our facilities. if these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could adversely impact the profitability of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach of agreements with other counterparties, including, without limitation, offtakers or lenders.
at times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations, due to bankruptcy, insolvency, financial distress or other factors. furthermore, in the event of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency-type proceeding, our counterparty can seek to reject our existing ppa under the u.s. bankruptcy code or similar bankruptcy laws, including those in puerto rico. we may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. if we were unable to enter into replacement ppas, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. a breach by a counterparty of a ppa or other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, including, without limitation, the debt documents of the affected business.
the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. any failure of a supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to the aes corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
the market price of our common stock may be volatile.
the market price and trading volumes of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. factors that could affect the price of our common stock include, among other factors, general conditions in our industry and the power markets in which we participate, environmental and economic developments, and general credit and capital markets conditions, as well as developments specific to us, including risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility, failing to meet our publicly announced guidance or other risk factors described in item 1a.-risk factors and key trends and other matters described in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations.
risks associated with our operations we do a significant amount of business outside the united states, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks.
a significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the united states and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in certain developing countries in which aes has an existing presence. we believe these countries may have higher growth rates and offer greater opportunities, with potentially higher returns than in some more developed countries. international operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:
•   economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;
•   adverse changes in currency exchange rates;
•   government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;
•   unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary, fiscal or environmental policies;
•   high inflation and monetary fluctuations;
•   restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;
•   threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;
•   unexpected delays in permitting and governmental approvals;
•   unexpected changes or instability affecting our strategic partners in developing countries;
•   risks relating to the failure to comply with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, uk bribery act or other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations, including, among other things, cost and disruption in responding to allegations or investigations (regardless of ultimate finding), civil and/or criminal fines, criminal prosecution of individuals, revocation or suspension of permits and/or licenses, civil litigation, reputational damage, loss in share price, and loss of business;
•   difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with gaap expertise;
•   unwillingness of governments and their agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;
•   unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the company and less beneficial to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;
•   inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;
•   adverse changes in government tax policy;
•   difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and
•   potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.
any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. the volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. this volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. a number of our businesses are facing challenges associated with regulatory changes.
the operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results.
we are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including:
•   changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures, tsunamis, explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and
•   changes in our operating cost structure, including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.
our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. the availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. limitations, or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses' results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
in addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. the equipment at our plants, whether old or new, is also likely to require periodic upgrading, improvement or repair, and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. the inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts may impact the ability of our plants to perform and could, therefore, have a material impact on our business and results of operations. breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for liquidated damages and/or other penalties.
power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. in addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. the control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks.
the hazards described above, along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. the occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties.
we and/or our subsidiaries may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.
power generation, distribution and transmission involves hazardous activities. we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. we maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable and due to the cyclical nature of the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. in addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute.
the occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results or operations, financial condition, and prospects.
we may not be able to enter into long-term contracts that reduce volatility in our results of operations.
many of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a stable revenue and cost structure. in these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. the remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to more than 20 years. in many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. in these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. the loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. the inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.
we have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations. however, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment-grade credit rating, and our generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. we have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful.
competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.
the power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to, or greater than, ours. further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. in certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. the evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants and renewables such as wind and solar have also caused, and could continue to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. in addition, the introduction of low-cost disruptive technologies or the entry of non-traditional competitors into our sector and markets could adversely affect our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition.
our businesses will need to continue to adapt to technological change and we may incur significant expenditures to adapt to these changes.
emerging technologies may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, investments and infrastructure, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive, or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets. our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services and products that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards.
technological changes that could impact our businesses include:
•   technologies that change the utilization of electric generation, transmission and distribution assets, including the expanded cost-effective utilization of distributed generation (e.g., rooftop solar and community solar projects), and energy storage technology;
•   advances in distributed and local power generation and energy storage that reduce the demand for large-scale renewable electricity generation and/or impact our customers' ability to perform under long-term agreements; and
•   more cost-effective batteries for energy storage, advances in solar or wind technology, and advances in alternative fuels and other alternative energy sources.
emerging technologies may also allow new competitors to more effectively compete in our markets or disintermediate the services we provide our customers, including traditional utility and centralized generation services. if we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes, fail to adapt to significant technological changes, fail to obtain access to important new technologies, fail to recover a significant portion of any remaining investment in obsolete assets, or if implemented technology fails to operate as intended, our businesses, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology.
our businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. our businesses forecast electric sales based on best available information and expectations for weather, which represents a long-term historical average. while we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.
changes in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, our wind and solar facilities. for example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, our results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically, and our results of operations generally, may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. to the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected.
in addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.
if hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, our contracts in certain markets where hydroelectric facilities are prevalent may require us to purchase power in the spot markets when our facilities are unable to operate (or operate at lower than anticipated levels) and the price of such spot power may increase substantially in times of low hydrology.
severe weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business and adversely affect our financial results.
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities. in addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, icing events, earthquakes, dam failures and tsunamis can be destructive and could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course by causing power outages and property damage, reducing revenue, affecting the availability of fuel and water, causing injuries and loss of life, and requiring us to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power and to access available financing sources. our power plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, including heatwaves, fewer cold temperature extremes, abnormal levels of precipitation resulting in river and coastal urban floods in north america or reduced water availability and increased flooding across central and south america, and changes in coast lines due to sea level change.
depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires; releases of natural gas, natural gas odorant, or other greenhouse gases; explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; personal injuries, health impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide electricity and natural gas to our customers.
a disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. at our businesses where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred.
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.
our development projects are subject to substantial uncertainties.
certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing power plants. some but not all of these power plant projects have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. successful completion of the development of these projects depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. for additional information regarding our projects under construction see item 1.-business-our organization and segments included in this form 10-k.
in certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though the subsidiaries have not yet secured financing, power purchase arrangements, or other important elements for a successful project. for example, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment even where they do not have financing, a ppa or critical permits in place (or conversely, to enter into a ppa, procurement agreement or other agreement without financing in place). if the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may remain obligated for certain liabilities even though the project will not proceed. development is inherently uncertain and we may forgo certain development opportunities and we may undertake significant development costs before determining that we will not proceed with a particular project. we believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. if these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. at the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.
we do not control certain aspects of our joint ventures.
we have invested in some joint ventures in which our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights with our joint venture partners. in many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on the board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. however, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business in every instance and we may be dependent on our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or businesses. our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. in some joint venture agreements in which we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting minority rights to the other shareholders.
the approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. the control or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may result in operational management and/or investment decisions that are different from the decisions our subsidiaries would make if they operated independently and could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures. in addition, in the event that a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations to the joint venture or its share of liabilities at the joint venture, we may be subject to joint and several liability for these joint ventures, which means that we may be responsible for meeting certain obligations of the joint ventures, should our joint venture partner be unable to do so, if and to the extent provided for in our governing documents or applicable law.
our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties, including development, operational, and regulatory challenges.
wind, solar, and energy storage projects are subject to substantial risks. some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future.
furthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. for example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer. these wind resource estimates are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year, but long-term averages of a resource.
as a result, these types of renewable energy projects face considerable risk, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. in addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in generation and utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of our more limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. there are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. these projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third-party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. as a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects or obtain third-party financing for these projects.
government incentives and policies that support the development of renewable energy generation projects could change at any time.
aes' u.s. renewable energy generation growth strategy depends in part on federal, state and local government policies and incentives that support the development, financing, ownership and operation of renewable energy generation projects. these policies and incentives include investment tax credits, production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, renewable portfolio standards, feed-in-tariffs and similar programs, renewable energy credit mechanisms, and tax exemptions. if these policies and incentives are changed or eliminated, or aes is unable to use them, it could result in a material adverse impact on aes' u.s. renewable growth opportunities, including fewer future ppas or lower prices for the sale of power in future ppas, decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing.
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends, in part, on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. for example, we routinely assess the financial impacts of complicated business transactions that occur on a worldwide basis. these assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in u.s. gaap to timely and accurately comply with u.s. reporting obligations. an inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial and tax reporting.
cyber-attacks and data security breaches could harm our business.
our business is heavily reliant on electronic systems and network technologies to operate our generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. we also use various financial, accounting and other infrastructure systems. our infrastructure may be targeted by nation states, hacktivists, criminals, insiders or terrorist groups. such an attack, by hacking, malware or other means, may interrupt our operations, cause property damage, affect our ability to control our infrastructure assets, cause the release of sensitive customer information or limit communications with third parties. any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through such breach may:
•   impair our reputation;
•   impact our operations and strategic objectives;
•   impact our customer and vendor relationships;
•   result in substantial revenue loss;
•   expose us to legal claims and/or regulatory investigations and proceedings; and
•   require extensive repair and restoration costs for additional security measures to avert future cyber-attacks.
in addition, a breach of our financial and accounting systems could impact our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.
in addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage and other information. the theft, damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations, and harm our reputation. the eu gdpr recently came into force and applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the eu. the gdpr creates new compliance obligations and significantly increases fines for noncompliance.
we have implemented measures to help prevent unauthorized access to our systems and facilities, including certain measures to comply with mandatory regulatory reliability standards. to date, cyber-attacks on our business and operations have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. we continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments to address them, including global monitoring of networks and systems, identifying and implementing new technology, improving user awareness through employee security training, and updating our security policies as well as those for third-party providers. we cannot guarantee the extent to which our security measures will prevent future cyber-attacks and security breaches or that our insurance coverage will adequately cover any losses we may experience.
our utilities businesses may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or in customer usage.
customer growth and customer usage in our utilities businesses are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. a lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in customer demand for electricity may cause us to fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.
we have 30 defined benefit plans, five at u.s. subsidiaries and the remaining plans at foreign subsidiaries, which cover substantially all of the employees at these subsidiaries. pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. we periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. our exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans include a significant weighting of investments in fixed income securities that are generally less volatile than investments in equity securities. future downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. our subsidiaries that participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdictions for any shortfall of pension plan assets as compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. satisfying such funding requirements may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the parent company and our subsidiaries' liquidity. for additional information regarding the funding position of the company's pension plans, see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
57
of operations-critical accounting policies and estimates-pension and other postretirement plans and note 13.-benefit plans included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data included in this form 10-k.
impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
as of december 31, 2018, the company had approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3% of the total assets on its consolidated balance sheets. goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. we may be required to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we experience situations, including but not limited to: deterioration in general economic conditions, or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; lower forecasted revenue; increase in fuel costs, particularly when we are unable to pass through the impact to customers; increase in environmental compliance costs; negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms; developments in our strategy; divestiture of a significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. for example, during the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of october 1, 2018, the company determined that the fair value of its gener reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 7%. therefore, gener's $868 million goodwill balance was considered to be "at risk" for impairment as of december 31, 2018 largely due to the fact that a market participant would no longer assume perpetual cash flows from coal-fired power plants due to the increased penetration of renewable energy in chile. see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-key trends and uncertainties-impairments. these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment, which could substantially affect our results of operations for those periods. additionally, goodwill may be impaired if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. see the risk factor our acquisitions may not perform as expected for further discussion.
long-lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment only when impairment indicators, similar to those described above for goodwill, are present, whereas goodwill is also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis.
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
our acquisitions may not perform as expected.
historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. we may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. some of these businesses may have been government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. if we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that:
•   we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;
•   such businesses will perform as expected;
•   integration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected;
•   we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;
•   such businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or
•   the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest capital to acquire them.
risks associated with governmental regulation and laws our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.
our ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any ability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:
•   changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;
•   changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utility's operating income or the rates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;
•   changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;
•   adverse changes in tax law;
•   changes in law or regulation which limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill their obligations (including payment obligations) to us or our subsidiaries;
•   changes in environmental law which impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities within our subsidiaries;
•   changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;
•   changes in the timing of tariff increases;
•   other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;
•   other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or
•   other changes that impact the short- or long-term price-setting mechanism in the markets where we operate.
any of the above events may result in lower operating margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business.
in many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact of the regulations on our businesses. the impacts described above could also result from our (or our subsidiaries') efforts to comply with european market infrastructure regulation, which includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives. it is also possible that additional similar regulations may be passed in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the company.
several of our businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with ccr.
ccr, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes generated at our current and former coal-fired generation plant sites, is currently handled and/or has been handled in the past in the following ways: placement in onsite ccr ponds; disposal and beneficial use in onsite and offsite permitted, engineered landfills; use in various beneficial use applications, including encapsulated uses and structural fill; and used in permitted offsite mine reclamation. ccr currently remains onsite at several of our facilities, including in ccr ponds. the u.s. epa's final ccr rule, which became effective in october 2015, regulates ccr as nonhazardous solid waste and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new ccr landfills and existing and new ccr ponds, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements and post-closure care. on december 16, 2016, president obama signed the win act into law, which includes provisions to implement the ccr rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. the primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation could be actions commenced by u.s. epa, states, or territories, and private lawsuits. compliance with the u.s. federal ccr rule; amendments to the federal ccr rule; or federal, state, territory, or foreign rules or programs addressing ccr may require us to incur substantial costs. in addition, the company and our businesses may face ccr-related lawsuits in the united states and/or internationally that may expose us to unexpected potential liabilities. furthermore, ccr-related litigation may also expose us to unexpected costs. in addition, ccr, and its production at several of our facilities, have been the subject of significant interest from environmental non-governmental organizations and have received national and local media attention. the direct and indirect effects of such media attention, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may divert management time and attention. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.
our business in the united states is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by ferc and nerc, including purpa, the federal power act, and the epact 2005. actions by ferc, nerc and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations.
the aes corporation is a registered electric holding company under the 2005 puhca as enacted as part of the epact 2005. puhca 2005 eliminated many of the restrictions that had been in place under the 1935 pucha, while continuing to provide ferc and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. puhca 2005 also creates additional potential challenges and opportunities. by removing some barriers to mergers and other potential combinations, the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies is more likely. these entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the u.s. market.
other parts of the epact 2005 allow ferc to remove the purpa purchase/sale obligations from utilities if there are adequate opportunities to sell into competitive markets. ferc has exercised this power with a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of miso, pjm, iso new england, inc., the new york independent system operator, inc., and ercot are not required to purchase or sell power from or to qfs above a certain size. additionally, ferc has the power to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. while these changes do not affect existing contracts, certain of our qfs that have had sales contracts expire are now facing a more difficult market environment and that is likely to continue for other aes qfs with existing contracts that will expire over time.
in accordance with congressional mandates in the epact 1992 and the epact 2005, ferc has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. among other steps, ferc has encouraged rtos and isos to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. these programs may reduce the value of generation assets. similarly, ferc is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of epact 2005. although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets.
ferc has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of part ii of the fpa, which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. the fpa also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the fpa. this penalty authority was enhanced in epact 2005. as a result, ferc is authorized to assess a maximum penalty authority established by statute and such penalty authority has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. with this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the fpa and ferc's regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.
pursuant to epact 2005, the nerc has been certified by ferc as the electric reliability organization ("ero") to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the u.s. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. these standards are subject to ferc review and approval. once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by ferc independently, or, alternatively, by the ero and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to ferc oversight. violations of nerc reliability standards are subject to ferc's penalty authority under the fpa and epact 2005.
our utility businesses in the u.s. face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. the regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in both indiana and ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. these businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. see item 1.-business-us sbu-u.s. businesses-u.s. utilities for further information on the regulation faced by our u.s. utilities.
our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations.
our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. these laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation. failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any associated environmental permits could result in fines or other sanctions. for example, in recent years, the epa has issued notices of violation (novs) to a number of coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the caa. the epa has brought suit against and obtained settlements with many companies for allegedly making major modifications to a coal-fired generating units without proper permit approvals and without installing best available control technology. the primary focus of these novs has been emissions of so2 and nox and the epa has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce such emissions. in addition, state regulatory agencies and non-governmental environmental organizations have pursued civil lawsuits against power plants in situations that have resulted in judgments and/or settlements requiring the installation of expensive pollution controls or the accelerated retirement of certain electric generating units.
furthermore,congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air emissions and water discharges. these laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. see the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in item 1.-business-environmental and land-use regulations of this form 10-k.
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. changes in, or new development of, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations.
concerns about ghg emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses.
international, federal and various regional and state authorities regulate ghg emissions and have created financial incentives to reduce them. in 2018, the company's subsidiaries operated businesses that had total co2 emissions of approximately 55 million metric tonnes, approximately 23 million of which were emitted by our u.s. businesses (both figures are ownership adjusted). the company uses co2 emission estimation methodologies supported by "the greenhouse gas protocol" reporting standard on ghg emissions. for existing power generation plants, co2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type co2 emission factors. the estimated annual co2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the company's subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 7 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). this overall estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, co2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion of such construction and development projects. however, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of ghg emissions. because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates.
there currently is no u.s. federal legislation imposing mandatory ghg emission reductions (including for co2) that affects our electric power generation facilities; however, in 2015, the epa promulgated a rule establishing new source performance standards for co2 emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled eusgus larger than 25 mw. also in 2015, the epa promulgated the clean power plan (cpp), which requires interim reductions by preexisting eusgus beginning in 2022, with full compliance achieved by 2030. these actions have been challenged in court and the current administration has announced plans to significantly amend or rescind the rules. in 2016, the epa adopted regulations pertaining to ghg emissions that require new and existing sources of ghg emissions to potentially obtain new source review permits from the epa prior to construction or modification, but only if such sources also must obtain a new source review permit for increases in other regulated pollutants.
for further discussion of the regulation of ghg emissions, including the u.s. supreme court's issued order staying implementation of the cpp, and the epa's proposal to rescind the cpp, see item 1.-business-environmental and land-use regulations-united states environmental and land-use legislation and regulations-greenhouse gas emissions above.
in december 2015, the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change convened for the 21st conference of the parties and the resulting paris agreement established a long-term goal of keeping the
61
increase in global average temperature well below 2°c above pre-industrial levels. we anticipate that the paris agreement will continue the trend toward efforts to de-carbonize the global economy and to further limit ghg emissions.
the impact of ghg regulation on our operations will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of ghg emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive ghg emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. the costs of compliance could be substantial.
our non-utility, generation subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from co2 emissions to contract counterparties. likewise, our utility subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from co2 emissions to customers. however, there can be no assurance that we will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or customers, respectively, or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly.
in addition to government regulators, many groups , including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about ghg emissions. negative public perception of our ghg emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers or our business development opportunities. in addition, plaintiffs previously brought tort lawsuits against the company because of its subsidiaries' ghg emissions. while these lawsuits were dismissed, future similar lawsuits may prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. we may also be subject to risks associated with the impact on weather conditions. see item 1a.-risk factors-certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology and severe weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business and adversely affect our financial results for more information.
if any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on our electric power generation businesses and on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition,cash flows and reputation.
tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our subsidiaries have operations in the u.s. and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the u.s. federal, state and local governments and of many non-u.s. jurisdictions. from time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these legislative measures.
the tcja enacted december 22, 2017 introduced significant changes to current u.s. federal tax law, including but not limited to lowering the corporate income tax rate, introducing new limits on interest expense deductibility, and changing the way in which foreign earnings are taxed. these changes are complex and are subject to additional guidance to be issued by the u.s. treasury and the internal revenue service. in addition, the reaction to the federal tax changes by the individual states is evolving. our interpretations and assumptions around u.s. tax reform may evolve in future periods as further administrative guidance and regulations are issued, which may materially affect our effective tax rate or tax payments. for further details, please see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-key trends and uncertainties in this form 10-k.
additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine how and where cross-border international trade is subjected to tax are evolving. the organization for economic cooperation and development, in coordination with the g8 and g20, through its base erosion and profit shifting project introduced a series of recommendations that many tax jurisdictions have adopted, or may adopt in the future, as law. as these and other tax laws, related regulations and double-tax conventions change, our financial results could be materially impacted. given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our results of operations.
u.s. federal, state and local, as well as non-u.s., tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, there could be a material impact on our results of operations.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary in 2018, aes delivered strong financial results and achieved significant milestones on its strategic goals, including continuing to enhance the resilience of the portfolio and growing the backlog of renewable projects. the company achieved a key investment grade metric, completed construction of 1.3 gw of new projects and signed long-term ppas for 2 gw of renewable capacity. see overview of our strategy included in item 1.-business of this form 10-k for further information.
during 2018, the company saw increased margins at its south america, mcac and us and utilities sbus. these increases were primarily due to higher tariffs and rates in argentina and the u.s., higher contract prices in colombia, new ppas in chile, and increased sales due to the commencement of operations at the colon combined cycle facility in panama and eagle valley ccgt in the u.s. the company also experienced decreased margins in the eurasia sbu due to completed sales of masinloc in 2018 and the kazakhstan facilities in 2017. in addition, the company reduced its recourse debt by approximately $1 billion in 2018, resulting in a decrease in parent company interest.

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $2.25 to $1.48 for the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to a loss of $0.77 for the year ended december 31, 2017. this increase was primarily due to the current year gains on sales of masinloc, ctng and electrica santiago, prior year loss on sale of the kazakhstan chps and hpps, prior year impairments at dpl, laurel mountain and in kazakhstan, lower interest expense at the parent company and gener, a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings following the enactment of the tcja in the prior year, and higher margins. these increases were partially offset by higher current year tax expense due to the new gilti rules in the u.s. in large part due to the sale of our interest in masinloc, the current year impairment at shady point, other-than-temporary impairment of the guacolda equity method investment in chile, foreign exchange losses mainly due to the devaluation of the argentine peso and foreign currency gains in the prior year, higher current year losses on extinguishment of debt, and a favorable legal settlement at uruguaiana in the prior year.
adjusted eps, a non-gaap measure, increased $0.16, or 15%, to $1.24, reflecting higher margins at the south america, us and utilities and mcac sbus and lower interest on parent company debt. these increases were partially offset by lower margin at the eurasia sbu mainly driven by the sales of masinloc and kazakhstan.

components of revenue, cost of sales and operating margin - revenue includes revenue earned from the sale of energy from our utilities and the capacity and production of energy from our generation plants, which are classified as regulated and non-regulated, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations. revenue also includes the gains or losses on derivatives associated with the sale of electricity.
cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business. examples include electricity and fuel purchases, operations and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization expense, bad debt expense and recoveries, and general administrative and support costs (including employee-related costs directly associated with the operations of the business). cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel.
operating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales.
consolidated revenue and operating margin year ended december 31, 2018
revenue
(in millions)
consolidated revenue - revenue increased $206 million, or 2%, in 2018 compared to 2017. excluding the unfavorable fx impact of $52 million, primarily in south america partially offset by eurasia, this increase was driven by:
•   $357 million in south america primarily due to higher contract sales and prices in colombia and the commencement of new ppas at angamos and cochrane in chile, as well as higher capacity prices in argentina resulting from market reforms enacted in 2017;
•   $215 million in mcac primarily due to to the commencement of operations at the colon combined cycle facility as well as improved hydrology at panama, higher pass-through fuel prices in mexico, higher contracted energy sales due to commencement of operations at the los mina combined cycle facility in june 2017, and higher spot prices in the dominican republic; and
•   $68 million in us and utilities driven primarily by higher market energy sales at southland, higher regulated rates commencing in november 2017 at dpl, higher wholesale volume due to the new ccgt coming online as well as higher retail demand at ipl, and higher prices due to tariff reset and higher energy prices in el salvador, partially offset by the sale and closure of several generation facilities at dpl.
these favorable impacts were partially offset by decreases of $366 million in eurasia due to the sale of the masinloc power plant in march 2018, as well as the sale of the kazakhstan chps and expiration of the kazakhstan hpp concession agreement in 2017.
operating margin
(in millions)
consolidated operating margin - operating margin increased $108 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017. excluding the favorable impact of fx of $8 million, primarily driven by eurasia, this increase was driven by:
•   $154 million in south america primarily due to the drivers discussed above and the absence of maintenance costs for planned outages in 2018 versus maintenance performed in q3 2017 at gener chile;
•   $70 million in mcac primarily due to drivers discussed above; and
•   $40 million in us and utilities mostly due to the drivers discussed above and the favorable impact of a one time reduction in the aro liability at dpl's closed plants, stuart and killen.
these favorable impacts were partially offset by a decrease of $204 million in eurasia due to the drivers discussed above.
year ended december 31, 2017
revenue
(in millions)
consolidated revenue - revenue increased $249 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared to 2016. excluding the net favorable fx impact of $38 million, primarily in south america, the increase was driven by:
•   $249 million in south america primarily due to the start of commercial operations at cochrane as well as higher availability at argentina, partially offset by lower spot sales at chivor; and
•   $248 million in mcac primarily due to the commencement of the combined cycle operations at los mina in june 2017 as well as higher rates in the dominican republic.
these favorable impacts were partially offset by decreases of $168 million in us & utilities mainly due to lower retail tariffs, lower wholesale volume and price at dpl as well as hurricane impacts at puerto rico, partially offset by higher pass through costs in el salvador.
operating margin
(in millions)
consolidated operating margin - operating margin increased $82 million, or 3%, in 2017 compared to 2016. excluding the favorable impact of fx of $39 million, primarily in brazil, argentina, and colombia, the increase was primarily driven by:
•   $73 million in mcac due to the commencement of the los mina combined cycle operations in june 2017 in the dominican republic as well as higher availability due to forced outages in 2016 at mexico.
these positive impacts were partially offset by a decreases of $26 million in us and utilities driven by lower retain margin, lower volumes, and lower commercial availability at dpl as well as a negative impact at ipl mainly due to one-off accruals due to the implementation of new base rates in q2 2016.

consolidated results of operations - other general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include expenses related to corporate staff functions and initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources and information systems, as well as global development costs.
general and administrative expenses decreased $23 million, or 11%, to $192 million for 2018, compared to $215 million for 2017 primarily due to reduced people costs, professional fees and business development activity.
general and administrative expenses increased $21 million, or 11%, to $215 million for 2017, compared to $194 million for 2016 primarily due to severance costs related to workforce reductions associated with a major restructuring program, increased professional fees and increased business development activity.
interest expense interest expense decreased $114 million, or 10%, to $1,056 million for 2018, compared to $1,170 million for 2017 primarily due to the reduction of debt at the parent company, favorable impacts from interest rate swaps in chile and increased capitalized interest at alto maipo.
interest expense increased $36 million, or 3%, to $1,170 million for 2017, compared to $1,134 million for 2016 primarily due to an increase at the south america sbu, driven by lower capitalized interest in 2017 due to the cochrane plant starting commercial operations in the second half of 2016.
interest income interest income increased $66 million, or 27%, to $310 million for 2018, compared to $244 million for 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates and increased long term receivables as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
interest income decreased $1 million in 2017 from 2016 with no material drivers.
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt increased $120 million to $188 million for 2018, compared to $68 million for 2017. this increase was primarily due to higher losses at the parent company of $79 million from the redemption of senior notes and a prior year gain on early retirement of debt at aes argentina of $65 million; partially offset by lower losses at other subsidiaries of $24 million in 2018.
loss on extinguishment of debt increased $55 million to $68 million for 2017, compared to $13 million for 2016 primarily related to losses of $92 million, $20 million, and $9 million on debt extinguishments at the parent company, aes gener, and ipalco, respectively. the loss was partially offset by a gain on early retirement of debt at aes argentina of $65 million.
other income other income decreased $48 million, or 40%, to $72 million for 2018, compared to $120 million for 2017 primarily due to the 2017 favorable settlement of legal proceedings at uruguaiana related to ypf's breach of the parties' gas supply agreement and a decrease in allowance for funds used during construction in the us and utilities sbu. these decreases were partially offset by a gain on remeasurement of contingent liabilities for projects in hawaii in 2018.
other income increased $56 million, or 88%, to $120 million for 2017, compared to $64 million for 2016 primarily due to the 2017 favorable legal settlement mentioned above.
other expense other expense remained flat at $58 million for 2018, compared to 2017 primarily due to a loss resulting from damage associated with a lightning incident at the andres facility in the dominican republic in 2018 and higher non-service pension and other postretirement costs in 2018. this was offset by the 2017 write-off of water rights for projects that were no longer being pursued in the south america sbu and a loss on disposal of assets at dpl as a result of the decision to close the coal-fired and diesel-fired generating units at stuart and killen.
73
other expense decreased $22 million, or 28%, to $58 million for 2017, compared to $80 million for 2016 primarily due to the 2016 recognition of a full allowance on a non-trade receivable in the mcac sbu as a result of payment delays. this decrease was partially offset by the 2017 loss on disposal of assets at dpl as a result of the decision to close the coal-fired and diesel-fired generating units at stuart and killen and the write-off of water rights in the south america sbu for projects that are no longer being pursued.

gain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests gain on disposal and sale of business interests was $984 million for 2018 primarily due to the $772 million gain on sale of masinloc and the $129 million and $69 million gains on sales of ctng and electrica santiago, respectively, in chile.
loss on disposal and sale of business interests was $52 million for 2017 primarily due to the $49 million and $33 million losses on sale of kazakhstan chps and hpps, respectively, partially offset by the recognition of a $23 million gain related to the expiration of a contingency at masinloc.
gain on disposal and sale of business interests was $29 million for 2016 primarily due to the $49 million gain on sale of dpler, partially offset by the $20 million loss on the deconsolidation of u.k. wind.

asset impairment expense asset impairment expense decreased $329 million, or 61%, to $208 million for 2018, compared to $537 million for 2017 mainly driven by prior year impairments of $186 million recognized in kazakhstan due to the classification of the chps and hpps as held-for-sale and $296 million in the u.s. as a result of the decision to sell the dpl peaker assets and a decline in forward pricing at laurel mountain, partially offset by a current year impairment of $157 million due to decreased future cash flows and the decision to sell shady point.
asset impairment expense decreased $559 million, or 51%, to $537 million for 2017, compared to $1,096 million for 2016 mainly driven by the impairment of $859 million at dpl in 2016, partially offset by a $121 million impairment at laurel mountain in 2017 as a result of a decline in forward pricing.

74
the company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $72 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 primarily due to the unrealized losses from the devaluation of receivables denominated in argentine pesos and realized losses from chilean pesos. these losses were partially offset by foreign currency derivative gains at the parent company.
the company recognized net foreign currency transaction gains of $42 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily driven by transactions associated with vat activity in mexico, the amortization of frozen embedded derivatives in the philippines, and appreciation of the euro in bulgaria. these gains were partially offset by foreign currency derivative losses in colombia due to a change in functional currency.
the company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $15 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to remeasurement losses on intercompany notes, and losses on swaps and options at the parent company. these losses were partially offset by foreign currency derivative gains related to government receivables in argentina.
other non-operating expense other non-operating expense was $147 million in 2018 primarily due to the $144 million other-than-temporary impairment of the guacolda equity method investment as a result of increased renewable generation in chile lowering energy prices and impacting the ability of guacolda to re-contract its existing ppas after they expire.
there were no significant other non-operating expenses in 2017 and 2016.
see note 7-investments in and advances to affiliates included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
income tax expense income tax expense decreased $282 million to $708 million in 2018 as compared to $990 million for 2017. the company's effective tax rates were 35% and 128% for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
the net decrease in the 2018 effective tax rate was primarily due to greater 2017 impacts related to u.s. tax reform one-time transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets, relative to the 2018 u.s. tax reform impact to adjust the provisional estimate recorded under sab 118, which provides sec guidance on the application of the accounting standards for the initial enactment impacts of the tcja. this net decrease was also attributable to the impact of the sale of the company's entire 51% equity interest in masinloc, offset by taxation of our foreign subsidiaries under u.s. gilti rules.
income tax expense increased $958 million to $990 million in 2017 as compared to $32 million for 2016. the company's effective tax rates were 128% and 17% for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the net increase in the 2017 effective tax rate was due primarily to the enactment of the tcja in the u.s., partially offset by the impacts of the 2016 chilean tax law reform and the 2016 devaluation of the mexican peso. see note 21-income taxes included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional information regarding the 2016 chilean income tax law reform.
our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the u.s., which are generally taxed at rates different than the u.s. statutory rate. foreign earnings may be taxed at rates higher than the u.s. corporate rate of 21% and are also subject to current u.s. taxation under the gilti rules introduced by the tcja. a future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. the company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. see note 21-income taxes included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional information regarding these reduced rates.
net equity in earnings of affiliates net equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $32 million, or 45%, to $39 million for 2018, compared to $71 million for 2017 primarily due to losses at fluence, which was formed in the first quarter of 2018, decreased income at guacolda, and larger gains on projects that achieved commercial operations in 2017 than in 2018 at spower, which was purchased in the third quarter of 2017.
net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $35 million, or 97%, to $71 million in 2017, compared to $36 million for 2016 primarily due to earnings at the spower equity method investment purchased in 2017, partially offset by fixed asset impairments in 2017 at the distributed energy entities, accounted for as equity affiliates.

net income (loss) from discontinued operations net income from discontinued operations was $216 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 primarily due to the after-tax gain on sale of eletropaulo of $199 million recognized in the second quarter of 2018 and the recognition of a $26 million deferred gain upon liquidation of borsod in october 2018.
net loss from discontinued operations was $629 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to the after-tax loss on deconsolidation of eletropaulo of $611 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. the remaining loss was due to a loss contingency recognized by our equity affiliate, partially offset by the income from operations of eletropaulo prior to the date of deconsolidation.
net loss from discontinued operations was $968 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 due to the sale of sul, partially offset by the income from operations of eletropaulo. the loss includes an after-tax loss on the impairment of sul of $382 million recognized in the second quarter of 2016 and an additional after-tax loss on the sale of sul of $737 million recognized upon disposal in october 2016. there was no significant loss from operations related to the sul discontinued business.

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries decreased $22 million, or 6%, to $362 million in 2018, compared to $384 million in 2017. this decrease was primarily due to:
•current year other-than-temporary impairment of guacolda;
•prior year favorable impact of a legal settlement at uruguaiana; and
•lower earnings due to deconsolidation of eletropaulo in november 2017 and the sale of masinloc in march 2018.
these decreases were partially offset by:
•current year gains on sales of electrica santiago and ctng in chile;
•higher earnings in colombia primarily due to higher contract sales and prices; and
•higher earnings in vietnam due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information).
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries increased $31 million, or 9%, to $384 million in 2017, compared to $353 million in 2016. this increase was primarily due to:
•asset impairments at buffalo gap i and ii in 2016.
these increases were partially offset by:
•income tax benefits at eletropaulo in 2016 (reflected within discontinued operations).
net income (loss) attributable to the aes corporation net income attributable to the aes corporation increased $2,364 million to $1,203 million in 2018, compared to a loss of $1,161 million in 2017. this increase was primarily due to:
•   gains on the sales of masinloc, eletropaulo (reflected within discontinued operations), ctng, and electrica santiago, and prior year losses on the sales of kazakhstan chps and hpps;
•   prior year loss on deconsolidation of eletropaulo (reflected within discontinued operations);
•   prior year impact of u.s. tax reform enacted in december 2017;
•   prior year asset impairments at dpl, laurel mountain and in kazakhstan;
•   lower interest expense at the parent company and gener; and
•   higher margins at our south america, mcac and us and utilities sbus.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   higher current year tax expense due to the new gilti rules in the u.s.;
•   current year impairment at shady point;
•   current year other-than-temporary impairment of guacolda;
•   higher losses on extinguishment of debt in the current year;
•   current year foreign exchange losses primarily due to the devaluation of the argentine peso and foreign currency gains in the prior year;
•   prior year favorable impact of a legal settlement at uruguaiana; and
•   lower margins in the current year at our eurasia sbu as a result of the sales of masinloc and kazakhstan.
net loss attributable to the aes corporation increased $31 million, or 3%, to $1,161 million in 2017, compared to $1,130 million in 2016. this increase was primarily due to:
•   impact of u.s. tax reform enacted in december 2017;
•   losses on the sales of kazakhstan chps and hpps;
•   loss on deconsolidation of eletropaulo (reflected within discontinued operations);
•   impairments at laurel mountain, kilroot and in kazakhstan; and
•   higher loss on extinguishment of debt.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   impairments at dpl in 2016;
•   loss on sale of sul in 2016 (reflected within discontinued operations);
•   favorable impact of a legal settlement at uruguaiana;
•   higher gains on foreign currency transactions; and
•   higher margins at our mcac sbu.
sbu performance analysis segments we are organized into four market-oriented sbus: us and utilities (united states, puerto rico and el salvador); south america (chile, colombia, argentina and brazil); mcac (mexico, central america and the caribbean); and eurasia (europe and asia). during the first quarter of 2018, the andes and brazil sbus were merged in order to leverage scale and are now reported together as part of the south america sbu. further, the puerto rico and el salvador businesses, formerly part of the mcac sbu, were combined with the us sbu, which is now reported as the us and utilities sbu.
non-gaap measures adjusted operating margin, adjusted ptc and adjusted eps are non-gaap supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders.
effective january 1, 2018, the company changed the definitions of adjusted ptc and adjusted eps to exclude unrealized gains or losses from equity securities resulting from a newly effective accounting standard. we believe excluding these gains or losses provides a more accurate picture of continuing operations. factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to equity securities remeasurement.
adjusted operating margin we define adjusted operating margin as operating margin, adjusted for the impact of nci, excluding (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions; (b) benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures; and (c) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations and office consolidation. the allocation of hlbv earnings to noncontrolling interests is not adjusted out of adjusted operating margin. see review of consolidated results of operations for definitions of operating margin and cost of sales.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted operating margin is operating margin. we believe that adjusted operating margin better reflects the underlying business performance of the company. factors in this determination include the impact of nci, where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly owned by the company, as well as the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests. adjusted operating margin should not be construed as an alternative to operating margin, which is determined in accordance with gaap.

adjusted ptc we define adjusted ptc as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations and office consolidation. adjusted ptc also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.
adjusted ptc reflects the impact of nci and excludes the items specified in the definition above. in addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in operating margin, adjusted ptc includes the other components of our consolidated statement of operations, such as general and administrative expenses in the corporate segment, as well as business development costs, interest expense and interest income, other expense and other income, realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and net equity in earnings of affiliates.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted ptc is income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation. we believe that adjusted ptc better reflects the underlying business performance of the company and is the most relevant measure considered in the company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests, retire debt or implement restructuring initiatives, which affect results in a given period or periods. in addition, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the company operates. given its large number of businesses and complexity, the company concluded that adjusted ptc is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the company's results.
adjusted ptc should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation, which is determined in accordance with gaap.

adjusted eps we define adjusted eps as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations and office consolidation; and (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 u.s. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted eps is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. we believe that adjusted eps better reflects the underlying business performance of the company and is considered in the company's internal evaluation of financial performance. factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests, retire debt or implement restructuring initiatives, which affect results in a given period or periods. adjusted eps should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with gaap.
the company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.77 and $0.04 per share for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. for purposes of measuring diluted loss per share under gaap, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. however, for purposes of computing adjusted eps, the company has included the impact of anti-dilutive common stock equivalents. the table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in gaap diluted loss per share to

increase at dpl primarily due to higher regulated rates following the approval of the 2017 esp and the 2018 distribution rate order and favorable weather                                   $35
increase at dpl driven by a one-time credit to depreciation expense, primarily as a result of a reduction in the aro liability at dpl's closed plants, stuart and killen                     32
increase at ipl due to higher wholesale margins driven by eagle valley coming online and higher retail margins due to favorable weather                                                      23
increase at southland driven by higher market energy sales, partially offset by a decrease in capacity sales and lower ancillary services due to the expiration of long-term agreements      12
decrease at hawaii primarily due to higher coal prices and lower gain on valuation of mtm commodity swaps                                                                                   (24   )

adjusted operating margin increased $55 million primarily due to the drivers above, adjusted for a $24 million unrealized loss on coal derivatives in hawaii partially offset by restructuring charges in the prior year.
adjusted ptc increased $87 million, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating margin described above, as well as an increase in the company's share of earnings at distributed energy due to new solar project growth, lower interest expense and the hlbv allocation of noncontrolling interest earnings at buffalo gap, partially offset by lower allowance for equity funds used during construction at ipalco.

decrease at dpl driven by lower retail margins due to lower regulated rates                                                            $(22   )
decrease at dpl primarily due to lower volumes due to the shutdown of stuart unit 1 and lower commercial availability                   (21   )
decrease at ipl due to implementation of new base rates in q2 2016 which resulted in a favorable change in accrual                      (18   )

adjusted operating margin decreased $14 million primarily due to the drivers above, excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, restructuring charges and costs associated with early plant closures.
adjusted ptc increased $32 million, driven by earnings from equity affiliates due to the 2017 acquisition of spower, the company's share of earnings at distributed energy due to new solar project growth and an increase in insurance recoveries at dpl. the increase in adjusted ptc was partially offset by the decrease of $14 million in adjusted operating margin described above and a 2016 gain on contract termination at dp&l.

adjusted ptc increased $18 million, driven by a $28 million increase from the settlement of a legal dispute with ypf at uruguaiana in 2017 and the $14 million increase in adjusted operating margin described above, as well as foreign currency gains in argentina associated with the collection of financing receivables, prepayment of financial debt denominated in u.s. dollars in 2017 and lower foreign currency losses associated with the sale of argentina's sovereign bonds at termoandes. these positive impacts were partially offset by higher interest expense, mainly due to the acquisition of alto sertão ii debt, issuance of debt at argentina and lower interest capitalization in cochrane and chivor, and the write-off of water rights at gener resulting from a business development project that is no longer pursued.

fiscal year 2018 versus 2017
including favorable fx impacts of $8 million, operating margin decreased $195 million, or 46%, which was driven primarily by the following (in millions):
impact of the sale of masinloc power plant in march 2018                                                             $(122   )

adjusted operating margin decreased $112 million, or 37%, primarily due to the drivers above, adjusted for nci.
adjusted ptc decreased $68 million, primarily driven by the decrease in adjusted operating margin discussed above, partially offset by the positive impact in vietnam due to increased interest income from the higher financing component of contract consideration as a result of adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018. see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies-new accounting standards adopted included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
fiscal year 2017 versus 2016

adjusted ptc increased $7 million, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating margin, adjusted for nci and excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivatives.
key trends and uncertainties during 2019 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses, and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our operating margin, net income attributable to the aes corporation and cash flows. we continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. for the risk factors related to our business, see item 1.-business and item 1a.-risk factors of this form 10-k.
macroeconomic and political the macroeconomic and political environments in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed during 2018. this could result in significant impacts to tax laws and environmental and energy policies. additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at the subsidiary level. see item 7a.-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further information.
united states tax law reform in december 2017, the united states enacted the tcja. the legislation significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate, introducing new limitations on interest expense deductions, subjecting foreign earnings in excess of an allowable return to current u.s. taxation, and adopting a semi-territorial corporate tax system. these changes impacted our 2018 effective tax rate and will materially impact our effective tax rate in future periods. furthermore, we anticipate that higher u.s. tax expense may fully utilize our remaining net operating loss carryforwards in the near term, which could lead to material cash tax payments in the united states. specific provisions of the tcja and their potential impacts on the company are noted below. our interpretation of the tcja may change as the u.s. treasury and the internal revenue service issue additional guidance. such changes may be material.
transition tax - as further explained in note 21-income taxes included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k we have concluded our analysis of the implementation impacts of the tcja and included adjustments to our previous estimates in accordance with the guidance of sab 118. our revised estimates took into account interpretative guidance issued in 2018 by the u.s. treasury in proposed regulations. in the first quarter of 2019, the u.s. treasury issued final regulations related to the one-time transition tax which further amended the guidance of the proposed regulations. we are still evaluating the final regulations which may have a material impact on our financial statements. the impacts of the final regulations will be reflected in our financial statements during the quarter ended march 31, 2019.
limitation on interest expense deductions - the tcja introduced a new limitation on the deductibility of net interest expense beginning january 1, 2018. the deduction will be limited to interest income, plus 30 percent of tax basis ebitda through 2021 (30 percent of ebit beginning january 1, 2022). this determination is made at the consolidated group level, although it applies separately to partnerships. while interest expense of regulated utilities may be exempt from the limitation, the proposed regulations issued by the u.s. treasury in 2018 would effectively limit interest expense of our u.s. utilities. the proposed regulations may change before they are fully enacted in final form and are not retroactive; we have not early adopted the proposed regulations. given typical project financing and current u.s. holding company debt levels, we anticipate that this limitation will materially, negatively impact our effective tax rate.
global intangible low taxed income ("gilti") - the tcja subjects the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to current u.s. taxation to the extent that those earnings exceed an allowable economic return on investment. the foreign earnings subject to current taxation under the gilti provision are not limited to those derived from intangible property and may include gains derived from some future asset sales. the gilti provision will subject a significant portion of our foreign earnings to current u.s. taxation. in 2018, the gilti provision materially, negatively impacted our effective tax rate and we expect this to continue in future years. prospectively, the consequences of the new gilti provision may be partially mitigated by foreign tax credits. proposed regulations were issued in 2018 by the u.s. treasury which provided further guidance on gilti and the related foreign tax credit, however there are further regulations expected and they may change before enacted in final form.
state taxes - the reactions of the individual states to federal tax reform are still evolving. most states will assess whether and how the federal changes will be incorporated into their state tax legislation. some states have already decided whether to conform to new provisions of the federal tax law, such as the one-time transition tax and gilti, while many other states have not yet enacted final legislation. as we expect higher taxable income in the future due to the federal changes, this may also lead to higher state taxable income. our current state tax provisions predominantly have full valuation allowances against state net operating losses. these positions will be re-assessed in the future as state tax law evolves and may result in material changes in position.
tax equity structures - our u.s. renewable energy portfolio operates primarily through tax equity partnerships. we cannot be certain of the impacts u.s. tax reform may have on availability or pricing of tax equity for future growth opportunities. impacts of provisions such as the lower tax rate and immediate expensing may impact the amount and timing of returns allocable to our partners in our existing tax equity structures.
puerto rico - our subsidiaries in puerto rico have a long-term ppa with state-owned prepa, which has been facing economic challenges that could result in a material adverse effect on our business in puerto rico.
the puerto rico oversight, management, and economic stability act ("promesa") was enacted to create a structure for exercising federal oversight over the fiscal affairs of u.s. territories and created procedures for adjusting debt accumulated by the puerto rico government and, potentially, other territories ("title iii"). finally, promesa expedites the approval of key energy projects and other critical projects in puerto rico.
promesa allowed for the establishment of an oversight board with broad powers of budgetary and financial control over puerto rico. the oversight board filed for bankruptcy on behalf of prepa under title iii in july 2017. as a result of the bankruptcy filing, aes puerto rico and aes ilumina's non-recourse debt of $317 million and $34 million, respectively, continue to be in default and are classified as current as of december 31, 2018. the company is in compliance with its debt payment obligations as of december 31, 2018.
after the events of hurricanes irma and maria in september 2017, puerto rico's infrastructure was severely damaged, including electric infrastructure and transmission lines. aes puerto rico resumed generation during the first quarter of 2018 and continues to be the lowest cost and epa compliant energy provider in puerto rico and a critical supplier to prepa. according to the us federal emergency management agency, as of january 2019 prepa's recovery status is at 99%.
the company's receivable balances in puerto rico as of december 31, 2018 totaled $68 million, of which $18 million was overdue. despite the disruption caused by the hurricanes and the title iii protection, prepa has been making substantially all of its payments to the generators in line with historical payment patterns.
a proposed energy public policy law was introduced in october 2018 which includes the elimination of coal as a source for electricity generation by january 1, 2028 and the accelerated deployment of renewables (20% by 2025; 50% by 2040 and 100% by 2050). aes puerto rico's long-term ppa with prepa expires december 31, 2027. puerto rico's senate and house of representatives are still debating certain amendments.
considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our assets in puerto rico of $598 million is recoverable as of december 31, 2018.
argentina - during the second quarter of 2018, all of the three-year cumulative inflation rates commonly used to evaluate argentina's inflation exceeded 100%. therefore, argentina's economy was determined to be highly inflationary. since the tariffs and debt at our primary businesses in argentina are denominated in usd, the functional currency of those businesses is usd. as such, the determination that the argentina economy is highly inflationary is not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial statements.
united kingdom - in june 2016, the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu, commonly referred to as "brexit." in january 2019, the uk parliament rejected a proposed withdrawal agreement that the eu had supported. the uk is expected to exit the eu on march 29, 2019. while the full impact of the brexit remains uncertain, these changes are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations and consolidated financial results.
libor phase out - in july 2017, the uk financial conduct authority announced the phase out of libor by the end of 2021. the alternative reference rate committee at the federal reserve is working to establish a new benchmark replacement rate. while aes maintains financial instruments that use libor as an interest rate benchmark, the full impact of the phase out is uncertain until a new replacement benchmark is determined and implementation plans are more fully developed.
regulatory maritza ppa review - the dg comp continues to review whether maritza's ppa with nek is compliant with the european commission's state aid rules. although no formal investigation has been launched by dg comp to date, maritza has engaged in discussions with the dg comp case team and representatives of bulgaria to discuss the agency's review. in the near term, maritza expects that it will engage in discussions with bulgaria to attempt to reach a negotiated resolution concerning dg comp's review. the anticipated discussions could involve a range of potential outcomes, including but not limited to termination of the ppa and payment of some level of compensation to maritza. any negotiated resolution would be subject to mutually acceptable terms, lender consent, and dg comp approval. at this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the anticipated discussions between maritza and bulgaria, nor can we predict how dg comp might resolve its review if the discussions fail to result in an agreement concerning the review. maritza believes that its ppa is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws, and it will take all actions necessary to protect its interests, whether through negotiated agreement or otherwise. however, there can be no assurances that this matter will be resolved favorably; if it is not, there could be a material adverse impact on maritza's and the company's respective financial statements.
considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying value of our long-lived assets at maritza of approximately $1.1 billion is recoverable as of december 31, 2018.
foreign exchange we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the usd, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. in 2018, there was a significant devaluation in the argentine peso against the usd, which had an impact on our 2018 results. continued material devaluation of the argentine peso against the usd could have an impact on our future results. for additional information, refer to item 7a.-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
alto maipo alto maipo has experienced cost overruns which have resulted in increased projected costs over the original $2 billion budget. construction at the project is continuing, and the project is 75% complete.
in february 2018, alto maipo entered into a new construction contract with strabag. the new contract is fixed-price and lump sum, transfers geological and construction risk to strabag and provides a date certain for completion with strong performance and completion guarantees.
in may 2018, alto maipo and the project's senior lenders executed the financial restructuring of the project. the restructuring, among other things, includes additional funding commitments of up to $400 million of which $200 million was already contributed by aes gener. any unused portion of aes gener's commitment will be used to prepay project debt.
if alto maipo is unable to meet certain construction milestones, there could be a material impact to the financing and value of the project which could have a material impact on the company. the carrying value of long-lived assets and deferred tax assets of alto maipo as of december 31, 2018 was approximately $2 billion and $60 million, respectively. management believes the carrying value of the long-lived asset group is recoverable as of december 31, 2018. in addition, management believes it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized; however, the deferred tax assets could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are decreased.
andres on september 3, 2018, lightning affected the andres 319 mw combined cycle natural gas facility in the dominican republic ("the plant") resulting in significant damage to its steam turbine and generator. the company has business interruption and property damage insurance coverage, subject to pre-defined deductibles, under its existing programs.
on september 25, 2018, the plant restarted operations running the gas turbine in simple cycle at partial load of approximately 120 mw. management estimates that the plant will operate the gas turbine in simple cycle at full load of approximately 185 mw starting in the second quarter of 2019, and in combined cycle at full capacity by the fourth quarter of 2019.
to mitigate the impact of the reduced capacity in the local energy market, the company installed 120 mw of rental power (gas turbines) until the combined cycle facility is at full load. the rental units were fully operational beginning in december 2018.
considering the information available as of the filing date, management believes the carrying amount of our long-lived assets in andres of $395 million is recoverable as of december 31, 2018.
changuinola tunnel leak increased water levels were noted in a creek near the changuinola power plant, a 223 mw hydroelectric power facility in panama. after the completion of an assessment, the company has confirmed loss of water in specific sections of the tunnel. the plant is in operation and can generate up to its maximum capacity. repairs will be needed to ensure the long term performance of the facility, during which time the affected units of the plant will be out of service. subject to final inspection, the repairs may take up to 10 months to complete and are expected to commence during the first quarter of 2019. the company has notified its insurers of a potential claim and has asserted claims against its construction contractor. however, there can be no assurance of collection. the company continues to monitor the situation to identify any potential changes to the tunnel. the company has not identified any indicators of impairment and believes the carrying value of the long-lived asset group of $931 million is recoverable as of december 31, 2018.
impairments long-lived assets and equity affiliates - during the year ended december 31, 2018, the company recognized asset and other-than-temporary impairment expense of $355 million. see note 7-investments in and advances to affiliates and note 20-asset impairment expense included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information. after recognizing this impairment expense, the carrying value of the equity affiliates and the asset groups, including long-lived assets, and those asset groups that were assessed and not impaired, totaled $661 million at december 31, 2018.
events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate recoverability tests and potential impairments of long-lived assets may include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not the asset will be disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life.
goodwill - the company considers a reporting unit at risk of impairment when its fair value does not exceed its carrying amount by more than 10%. during the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of october 1, 2018, the company determined that the fair value of its gener reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 7%. therefore, gener's $868 million goodwill balance was considered to be "at risk" as of december 31, 2018, largely due to the fact that a market participant would no longer assume perpetual cash flows from coal-fired power plants due to the increased penetration of renewable energy in chile.
through 2028, gener's plants remain largely contracted, with most of its ppas expiring between 2029 and 2037. the company utilized the income approach in deriving the fair value of the gener reporting unit, which included estimated cash flows assuming a 20-year annuity for thermal generation and longer term cash flows for hydro generation. these cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of 7%, which was determined based on the capital asset pricing model. see item 7.-critical accounting policies and estimates-fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities and note 8-goodwill and other intangible assets included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
the company monitors its reporting units at risk of step 1 failure on an ongoing basis, and believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations are reasonable. should the fair value of any of the company's reporting units fall below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, regulatory changes, or other adverse conditions, goodwill impairment charges may be necessary in future periods.
capital resources and liquidity overview - as of december 31, 2018, the company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion, of which $24 million was held at the parent company and qualified holding companies. the company also had $313 million in short term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries. in addition, we had restricted cash and debt service reserves of $837 million. the company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $15.6 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. of the approximately $1.7 billion of our current non-recourse debt, $825 million was presented as such because it is due in the next twelve months, $351
million relates to debt considered in default due to covenant violations, and $483 million relates to debt at colon which is in compliance with its covenants, but is presented as current since it is probable that the company cannot meet a technical covenant requirement by its deadline. none of the defaults are payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other covenants and/or other conditions such as (but not limited to) failure to meet information covenants, complete construction or other milestones in an allocated time, meet certain minimum or maximum financial ratios, or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents of the company. the company expects to modify the colon loan agreement in 2019 to amend the requirements of this technical covenant, after which the debt will be re-classified as noncurrent.
we expect such current maturities will be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates, through opportunistic refinancing activity or some combination thereof. we have $5 million of recourse debt which matures within the next twelve months. from time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes that such securities are attractively priced. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors. the amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material.
we rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. we have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies and related assets. our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross default risk to the parent company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. generally, a portion or all of the variable rate debt is fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. in addition, the debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. in certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. the majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals, export credit agencies and local regional banks.
given our long-term debt obligations, the company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. when possible, the company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. in addition, the company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. these efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. presently, the parent company's only material unhedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to indebtedness under its $366 million outstanding secured term loan due 2022. on a consolidated basis, of the company's $19.7 billion of total gross debt outstanding as of december 31, 2018, approximately $3.2 billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. brazil holds $1.1 billion of our floating rate non-recourse exposure as we have no ability to fix local debt interest rates efficiently.
in addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the parent company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. these investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. we generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. similarly, in certain of our businesses, the parent company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. in such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the parent company will be responsible for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. at december 31, 2018, the parent company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $712 million in aggregate (excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below).
as a result of the parent company's below investment grade rating, counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the parent company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. the parent company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. to the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. at december 31, 2018, we had $78 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under our senior secured credit facility, $368 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under our unsecured senior credit facility. these letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development and construction activities and business operations. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 1% to 3% per annum on the outstanding amounts.
we expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. however, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available on economically attractive terms or at all. if we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. if we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary.
many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. in addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses.

fiscal year 2018 versus 2017
cash provided by operating activities decreased $161 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to december 31, 2017, primarily driven by a decrease in net income, adjusted for non-cash items of $40 million, and a $121 million increase in working capital requirements.
the increase in working capital requirements of $121 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to december 31, 2017, was primarily driven by (in millions):
decreases in operating cash flow resulting from changes in:
prepaid expenses and other current assets, primarily due to an insurance recovery receivable at andres, advance payments to gas suppliers at colon, and prior year collections of net regulatory assets at eletropaulo, which was deconsolidated in q4 2017; partially offset by the impact of the sales of miami fort and zimmer and the retirement of the stuart facility at dpl     $(129   )
accounts payable and other current liabilities, primarily due to the deconsolidation of eletropaulo in q4 2017 and the timing of payments on coal purchases at gener; partially offset by the timing of payments on coal purchases at puerto rico                                                                                                                                       (101   )
other liabilities, primarily due to the deconsolidation of eletropaulo in q4 2017; partially offset by a prior year decrease in deferred tax and derivative liabilities at the parent company                                                                                                                                                                                            (57   )
accounts receivable, primarily due to lower collections at los mina and itabo, and higher sales at colon and chivor; partially offset by the deconsolidation of eletropaulo in q4 2017 and higher cammesa collections at alicura                                                                                                                                                         (29   )

parent company liquidity the following discussion of parent company liquidity is included as a useful measure of the liquidity available to the aes corporation, or the parent company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. parent company liquidity as outlined below is a non-gaap measure and should not be construed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents which is determined in accordance with gaap. parent company liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. the principal sources of liquidity at the parent company level are dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds, proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level, including availability under our credit facilities, and proceeds from asset sales. cash requirements at the parent company level are primarily to fund interest; principal repayments of debt; construction commitments; other equity commitments; common stock repurchases; acquisitions; taxes; parent company overhead and development costs; and dividends on common stock.
the company defines parent company liquidity as cash available to the parent company plus available borrowings under existing credit facilities plus cash at qualified holding companies. the cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the u.s. such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the parent company. parent company
92
liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure, cash and cash equivalents, at december 31, 2018 and 2017 as follows:
parent company liquidity (in millions)                                           2018              2017
consolidated cash and cash equivalents                                     $1,166              $949
less: cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries                            (1,142   )          (938   )
parent and qualified holding companies' cash and cash equivalents              24                11

less: borrowings under the credit facilities                                    -              (207   )
borrowings available under parent company credit facilities                 1,022               858
total parent company liquidity                                             $1,046              $869
the parent company paid dividends of $0.52 per share to its common stockholders during the year ended december 31, 2018. while we intend to continue payment of dividends and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, or if continued, the amount of such dividends.
recourse debt our total recourse debt was $3.7 billion and $4.6 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. see note 10-debt in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional detail.
while we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. in addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the parent company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. we can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. see item 1a.-risk factors-the aes corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise, of this form 10-k.
various debt instruments at the parent company level, including our senior secured credit facilities, contain certain restrictive covenants. the covenants provide for, among other items, limitations on other indebtedness; liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants at the parent company level.
non-recourse debt while the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the parent company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation:
•   reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the parent company during the time period of any default;
•   triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
•   causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and
•   triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the parent company.
for example, our senior secured credit facilities and outstanding debt securities at the parent company include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. in addition, our revolving credit agreement at the parent company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries.
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. the total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets amounts to $1.7 billion. as of december 31, 2018, $351 million of non-recourse debt was current related to such defaults at two subsidiaries, aes puerto rico and aes ilumina, and $483 million relates to debt at colon which is in
93
compliance with its covenants, but is presented as current since it is probable that the company cannot meet a technical covenant requirement by its deadline. the company expects to modify the colon loan agreement in 2019 to amend the requirements of this technical covenant, after which the debt will be re-classified as noncurrent. see note 10-debt in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional detail.
none of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under aes' corporate debt agreements as of december 31, 2018 in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under aes' indebtedness. however, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a "material subsidiary" and thereby upon an acceleration, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the parent company's outstanding debt securities. a material subsidiary is defined in the company's senior secured revolving credit facilities as any business that contributed 20% or more of the parent company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. as of december 31, 2018, none of the defaults listed above individually or in the aggregate results in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the company.

_____________________________
(1)   excludes normal and customary representations and warranties in agreements for the sale of assets (including ownership in associated legal entities) where the associated risk is considered to be nominal.
we have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. these obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. the risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. in addition, we have an
94
asset sale program through which we may have customary indemnity obligations under certain assets sale agreements. while we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2018, many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. we can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder.
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of aes are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. aes' significant accounting policies are described in note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, different estimates reasonably could have been used, or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee, as appropriate. listed below are the company's most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes - we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities. certain of the company's subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. tax reserves have been established, which the company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. while the company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.
because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. as an example, new tax laws were enacted in december 2017 in the u.s. which decreased the statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, required a one-time transition tax, and introduced numerous other changes. as further outlined in key trends and uncertainties, the company anticipates that the gilti provisions of u.s. tax reform could materially impact the effective tax rate in future periods. see note 21-income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
in accordance with sab 118, the company made reasonable estimates of the impacts of u.s. tax reform on its 2017 financial results, and recorded adjustments to those estimates in 2018 as analysis was completed. as of december 31, 2018, our analysis of the one-time impacts of the tcja is complete under sab 118. however, in the first quarter of 2019, the u.s. treasury department issued final regulations on the one-time transition tax. the final regulations include changes from the proposed regulations issued in 2018 and we expect to record the impacts of the final regulations in the first quarter of 2019. we are still evaluating the final regulations which may have a material impact on our financial statements.
in addition, no taxes have been recorded on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the company may be subject to additional foreign withholding and state income taxes.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income
95
tax bases. the company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the company has elected to treat gilti as an expense in the period in which the tax is accrued. accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to gilti.
sales of noncontrolling interests - sales of noncontrolling interests are recognized within stockholders' equity. effective january 1, 2018, the company adopted asu no. 2017-05, other income-gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets, which clarified the accounting for the sale of business interests as either the sale of nonfinancial assets or the sale of businesses. among other things, under the newly adopted guidance fewer transactions are expected to meet the definition of a business under the scope of asc 810 and will fall under the scope of the sale of nonfinancial assets.
prior to january 1, 2018, the accounting for a sale of noncontrolling interests was dependent on whether the sale was considered a sale of in-substance real estate, where the gain (loss) on sale would be recognized in earnings rather than within stockholders' equity. in-substance real estate is composed of land plus improvements and integral equipment. the determination of whether property, plant and equipment is integral equipment is based on the significance of the costs to remove the equipment from its existing location (including the cost of repairing damage resulting from the removal), combined with the decrease in the fair value of the equipment as a result of those removal activities. when the combined total of removal costs and the decrease in fair value of the equipment exceeds 10% of the fair value of the equipment, the equipment is considered integral equipment. the accounting standards specifically identify power plants as an example of in-substance real estate. where the consolidated entity in which noncontrolling interests have been sold contains in-substance real estate, management estimates the extent to which the total fair value of the assets of the entity is represented by the in-substance real estate and whether significant value exists beyond the in-substance real estate. this estimation considers all qualitative and quantitative factors relevant for each sale and, where appropriate, includes making quantitative estimates about the fair value of the entity and its identifiable assets and liabilities (including any favorable or unfavorable contracts) by analogy to the accounting standards on business combinations. as such, these estimates may require significant judgment and assumptions, similar to the critical accounting estimates discussed below for impairments and fair value.
impairments - our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies, included in item 8 of this form 10-k. the company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets, starting with determining if an impairment indicator exists. events that may result in an impairment analysis being performed include, but are not limited to: adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. the company exercises judgment in determining if these events represent an impairment indicator requiring the computation of the fair value of goodwill and/or the recoverability of long-lived assets. the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation. please see fair value below for further detail.
as part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. the level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.

fair value of financial instruments - a significant number of the company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. the company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit and mutual funds. derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. the company's derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. additional

discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in note -fair value included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities - significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. in addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and asset acquisitions by vies are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance.
the company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. the company generally utilizes the income approach to value nonfinancial assets and liabilities, specifically a discounted cash flow ("dcf") model to estimate fair value by discounting cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.
management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our cash flow forecasts. examples of the input assumptions that our forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., economic intelligence unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. it is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. as a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts.
a considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the dcf model. to the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., bloomberg). the company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. it is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate.
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities - we enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. we primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. see note -derivative instruments and hedging activities included in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information on the classification.
the fair value measurement standard requires the company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. these factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). due to the nature of the company's interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non-recourse debt, credit risk for aes is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the parent company level. nonperformance risk on the company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs.
as a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. as a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterparty's), and future exchange rates. refer to note 4-fair value included in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional details.
the fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal and third party valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs, including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. the company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., bloomberg, reuters and platt's). in some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument's fair value. in certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts, beyond the traded points the company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the

forward curve. additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on "indicative pricing" quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. these indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. for individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value.
regulatory assets - management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income.
consolidation - the company enters into transactions impacting the company's equity interests in its affiliates. in connection with each transaction, the company must determine whether the transaction impacts the company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model or the voting model. in determining which consolidation model applies to the transaction, the company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights.
if the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the company must consolidate the entity is whether the company, including its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. if aes is determined to have power and benefits, the entity will be consolidated by aes.
alternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-aes shareholders have substantive participating rights. the assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights requires significant judgment since the rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the compensation of management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, and establishing operating and capital decisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. on the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature (referred to as protective rights) then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall consolidate its investee. significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective rights that do not affect the evaluation of control. while both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlying activity or action to which the right relates.
pension and other postretirement plans - the company recognizes a net asset or liability reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement plans with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in aocl, except for those plans at certain of the company's regulated utilities that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligations through future rates. the valuation of the company's benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and net periodic benefit costs requires various estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. these assumptions are reviewed by the company on an annual basis. refer to note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
revenue recognition - the company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of energy, capacity and other services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. in applying the revenue model, we determine whether the sale of energy, capacity and other services represent a single performance obligation based on the individual market and terms of the contract. generally, the promise to transfer energy and capacity represent a performance obligation that is satisfied over time and meets the criteria to be accounted for as a series of distinct goods or services. progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured using output methods, such as mwhs delivered or mws made available, and when we are entitled to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly to the value of our performance completed to date, we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice. for further information regarding the nature of our revenue streams and our critical accounting policies affecting revenue recognition, see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8 of this form 10-k.

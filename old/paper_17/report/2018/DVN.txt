item 1a. risk factors our business and operations, and our industry in general, are subject to a variety of risks. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. if any of the following risks should occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted. as a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon.
14
index to financial statements volatile oil, gas and ngl prices significantly impact our business our financial condition, results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil, gas and ngls, which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities. historically, market prices and our realized prices have been volatile. for example, over the last five years, nymex wti oil and nymex henry hub prices ranged from a high of over $100 per bbl and $6 per mmbtu, respectively, to a low of under $27 per bbl and $1.70 per mmbtu, respectively. such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to:
•   the domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for oil, gas and ngls;

•   volatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets;

•   conservation and environmental protection efforts;

•   production levels of members of opec, russia or other producing countries;

•   geopolitical risks, including political and civil unrest in the middle east, africa and south america;

•   adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes;

•   regional pricing differentials, including in canada, the delaware basin and other areas of our operations;

•   differing quality of production, including ngl content of gas produced;

•   the level of imports and exports of oil, gas and ngls and the level of global oil, gas and ngl inventories;

•   the price and availability of alternative fuels;

•   technological advances affecting energy consumption and production;

•   the overall economic environment;

•   changes in trade relations and policies, including the imposition of tariffs by the u.s. or china; and

•   other governmental regulations and taxes.

the differential between wti and western canadian select, a benchmark for the canadian oil market, recently expanded, widening to nearly $46 per barrel in november 2018. as a result, our canadian heavy oil unhedged realized price for the fourth quarter was near zero. this negatively affected our results of operations in 2018, and a sustained weakness or further deterioration in differentials or commodity prices could materially and adversely impact our business by resulting in, or exacerbating, the following effects:
•   reducing the amount of oil, bitumen, gas and ngls that we can produce economically;

•   limiting our financial flexibility, liquidity and access to sources of capital, such as equity and debt;

•   reducing our revenues, operating cash flows and profitability;

•   causing us to decrease our capital expenditures or maintain reduced capital spending for an extended period, resulting in lower future production of oil, gas and ngls; and

•   reducing the carrying value of our properties, resulting in noncash write-downs.

estimates of oil, gas and ngl reserves are uncertain and may be subject to revision the process of estimating oil, gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, particularly for new discoveries. because of the high degree of judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. in addition, the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors, including additional development and appraisal activity, the viability of production under varying economic conditions, including commodity price declines, and variations in production levels and associated costs. consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties, as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability. our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in "items 1 and 2. business and properties" of this report.
15
index to financial statements discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. therefore, our estimated proved reserves and future oil, gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities, such as identifying additional producing zones in existing wells, utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves. consequently, our future oil, gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.
our operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks our operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. drilling for oil, gas and ngls can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs. substantial costs are required to locate, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs. our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted. while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. in addition, our oil and gas properties can become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
•   unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations;

•   equipment failures or accidents;

•   fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering or loss of well control, as well as the mishandling or underground migration of fluids and chemicals;

•   adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and extreme temperatures;

•   issues with title or in receiving governmental permits or approvals;

•   restricted takeaway capacity for our production, including due to inadequate midstream infrastructure or constrained downstream markets;

•   environmental hazards or liabilities;

•   restrictions in access to, or disposal of, water used or produced in drilling and completion operations; and

•   shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.

the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property, as well as significant liabilities. moreover, certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties, including persons living in proximity to our operations, our employees and employees of our contractors, leading to possible injuries, death or significant damage to property and natural resources.
in addition, we rely on our employees, consultants and sub-contractors to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and standards. any violation of such laws or standards by these individuals, whether through negligence, harassment, discrimination or other misconduct, could result in significant liability for us and adversely affect our business. for example, negligent operations by employees could result in serious injury, death or property damage, and sexual harassment or racial and gender discrimination could result in legal claims and reputational harm.
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which can change and could adversely impact our business our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and other laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to environmental matters, worker health and safety, wildlife conservation, the gathering and transportation of oil, gas and ngls, conservation policies, reporting obligations, royalty payments, unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes. such
16
index to financial statements regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling, completion and well operations and decommissioning obligations. if permits are not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. in addition, we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or orders. for example, certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by current and former operators, which may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible equipment and other restorative actions at the end of operations.
in addition, changes in public policy have affected, and in the future could further affect, our operations. regulatory and public policy developments could, among other things, restrict production levels, impose price controls, change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies. our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. in addition, changes in public policy may indirectly impact our operations by, among other things, increasing the cost of supplies and equipment and fostering general economic uncertainty. for example, changes in u.s. trade relations, particularly the imposition of tariffs by the u.s. and china, may increase the cost of materials we or our vendors use, thereby increasing our operating expense. although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity, particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing, pipeline safety, seismic activity and income taxes, as discussed below.
hydraulic fracturing - in recent years, the epa has made proposals that subject hydraulic fracturing to further regulation and that could potentially restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing. for example, the epa has issued final regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, and finalized in 2016 regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. the epa also released a study in 2016 finding that certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing, such as water withdrawals and wastewater management practices, could result in impacts to water resources, although the report did not identify a direct link between hydraulic fracturing and impacts to groundwater resources. the blm previously finalized regulations to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, but subsequently issued a repeal of those regulations in 2017. several states in which we operate have already adopted and more states are considering adopting laws or regulations that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. in addition, some states and municipalities have significantly limited drilling activities or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so or banning the practice altogether. although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these proposals, any new federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs, delays in development or restrictions on our operations.
pipeline safety - the pipeline assets in which we own interests, are subject to stringent and complex regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity management. the phmsa has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for gas, ngl and condensate transmission pipelines as well as certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids, such as oil, that, in the event of a failure, could affect "high consequence areas." additional action by phmsa with respect to pipeline integrity management requirements may occur in the future. for example, in 2016 phmsa proposed new rules for gas pipelines that extend pipeline safety programs beyond high consequence areas to newly proposed "moderate consequence areas" and would also impose more rigorous testing and reporting requirements on such pipelines. to date, no further action has been taken. phmsa has announced its intent to address the 2016 proposed rules for gas pipelines through three separate final rulemakings in 2019. more recently, in january 2017, phmsa finalized regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines that significantly extend and expand the reach of certain phmsa integrity management requirements (i.e., periodic assessments, leak detection and repairs), regardless of the pipeline's proximity to a high consequence area. the final rule also imposes new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including all hazardous liquid gathering lines. following the change in presidential administrations, implementation of this rule was delayed, but the final rule is expected to be published in the federal register and become effective during the first half of 2019. at this time, we cannot predict the cost of such requirements, but they could be significant. moreover, violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties.
seismic activity - earthquakes in northern and central oklahoma and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the energy industry. legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays, increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. in addition, we are currently defending against certain third-party lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims, seeking alleged property damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation.
17
index to financial statements changes to tax laws - we are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions, and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay. in the jurisdictions in which we operate, income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits. changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax, the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow.
concerns about climate change and related regulatory, social and market actions may adversely affect our business continuing and increasing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives, including international agreements, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. policy makers at both the u.s. federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases. for example, both the epa and the blm have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions, which also include leak detection and repair requirements, for the oil and gas industry. following the change in presidential administrations, however, the agencies have attempted to revise or rescind their previously issued methane standards. litigation concerning these methane regulations and subsequent attempts to revise or rescind them is ongoing. nevertheless, several states where we operate, including wyoming, have already imposed venting and flaring limitations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities. with respect to more comprehensive regulation, federal and state initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of cap-and-trade or carbon tax programs. as generally proposed, a cap-and-trade program would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances, while a carbon tax could impose taxes based on emissions from our operations and downstream uses of our products.
in canada, greenhouse gas emissions are also being addressed at both the federal and provincial level. devon will continue to be subject to alberta's climate change laws and regulations until at least 2021. those laws and regulations include a legislated oil sands emission limit, with forthcoming regulations involving methane emissions reduction targets. beginning january 2019, the greenhouse gas pollution pricing act subjects all of canada to a federal price on greenhouse gas emissions unless a province or territory has implemented a compliant carbon pricing regime. litigation concerning the act is ongoing, and it is unclear how the act will ultimately treat provincial plans. in alberta, large industrial emitters are subject to the carbon competitiveness incentive regulation (ccir). the ccir prices carbon, but provides cost protection to emission-intensive / trade-exposed industries, including devon's oil sands operations. the impact to our operations from these laws and regulations is expected to be minimal in the near term. oil and gas facilities that are not subject to the ccir are exempt from its economy-wide carbon levy until 2023.
in addition to regulatory risk, other market and social initiatives resulting from the changing perception of climate change present risks for our business. for example, in an effort to promote a lower-carbon economy, there are various public and private initiatives subsidizing the development of alternative energy sources, including by mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. these initiatives may reduce the competitiveness of carbon-based fuels, such as oil and gas. moreover, certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital have begun restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities due to their concern regarding climate change. such restrictions in capital could make it more difficult to secure funding to operate our business. finally, governmental entities and other plaintiffs have brought, and may continue to bring, claims against us and other oil and gas companies for purported damages caused by the alleged effects of climate change. these and the other regulatory, social and market risks relating to climate change described above could result in unexpected costs, increase our operating expense and reduce the demand for our products, which in turn could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.
our hedging activities limit participation in commodity price increases and involve other risks we enter into financial derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil, gas and ngl price volatility. to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we will be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts. moreover, as a result of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other legislation, hedging transactions and many of our contract counterparties have become subject to increased governmental oversight and regulations in recent years. although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws and the related rulemaking, some of which is ongoing, existing or future regulations may adversely affect the cost
18
index to financial statements and availability of our hedging arrangements, including by causing our contract counterparties, which are generally financial institutions and other market participants, to curtail or cease their derivatives activities.
the credit risk of our counterparties could adversely affect us we enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk. for example, we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements, our syndicated revolving credit facility and our insurance policies. disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.
in addition, we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade, joint interest billing and other receivables. we sell our oil, gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers, and, as an operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective share of costs. we also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets, including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells. certain of these counterparties may experience insolvency, liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) owed to, and assumed from, us, particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment. any such default by these counterparties may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and liabilities, which could adversely impact our financial results and condition.
our debt may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility, and any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely impact us as of december 31, 2018, we had total indebtedness of $5.9 billion. our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:
•   requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to debt service payments, thereby limiting our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including low commodity price environments; and

•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing due to higher costs and more restrictive covenants.

in addition, we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the u.s. with respect to our debt. factors that may impact our credit ratings include, among others, debt levels, planned asset sales and purchases, liquidity, forecasted production growth and commodity prices. we are currently required to provide letters of credit or other assurances under certain of our contractual arrangements. any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit, require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any other future debt.
environmental matters and related costs can be significant as an owner, lessee or operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, provincial, tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. these laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations. environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas. any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.
cyber attacks may adversely impact our operations our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, and we anticipate expanding our use of technology in our operations, including through process automation and data analytics. concurrent with this growing dependence on technology is greater sensitivity to cyberattack activities, which have been increasing against our industry. cyber attackers often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating sensitive information, intellectual property or financial assets,
19
index to financial statements corrupting data or causing operational disruptions. these attacks may be perpetrated by third parties or insiders. techniques used in these attacks range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access. cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service attacks. in addition, our vendors, midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber attacks, which, in turn, could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information. although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date, if we were successfully attacked, we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences, including litigation risks. moreover, as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities.
limited control on properties operated by others certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures. these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and delays, curtailments or cancellations of operations or future development, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales we rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our gas production and to transport our oil, gas and ngl production to downstream markets. all or a portion of our production in one or more regions may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants, pipelines or gathering systems. such access could be lost due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, weather conditions and natural disasters, accidents, field labor issues or strikes. additionally, the midstream operators may be subject to constraints that limit their ability to construct, maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production. such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability.
insurance does not cover all risks as discussed above, our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, gas and ngls. to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards, we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance, as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages, loss of well control, business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental. we also maintain workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance. however, our insurance coverage does not provide 100% reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards. additionally, we have limited or no insurance coverage for a variety of other risks, including pollution events that are considered gradual, war and political risks and fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities. the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.
competition for assets, materials, people and capital can be significant strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry. we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties. we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore, develop and operate properties. typically, during times of rising commodity prices, drilling and operating costs will also increase. during these periods, there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget. competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and ngls. certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and may have established superior strategic long-term positions and relationships, including with respect to midstream take-away capacity. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital and downstream markets. in addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as changing worldwide price and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations.
20
index to financial statements our business could be adversely impacted by investors attempting to effect change stockholder activism has been increasing in our industry, and investors may from time to time attempt to effect changes to our business or governance, whether by stockholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting our board of directors and employees from core business operations, requiring us to incur increased advisory fees and related costs, interfering with our ability to successfully execute on strategic transactions and plans and provoking perceived uncertainty about the future direction of our business.  such perceived uncertainty may, in turn, make it more difficult to retain employees and could result in significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock.
our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks our business depends, in part, on making acquisitions that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses. if we are unable to make attractive acquisitions, our future growth could be limited. furthermore, even if we do make acquisitions, they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks, including, but not limited to:
•   mistaken estimates or assumptions about reserves, potential drilling locations, revenues and costs, including synergies and the overall costs of equity or debt;

•   difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired assets or business; and

•   unknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections prove inadequate, including environmental liabilities and title defects.

in addition, from time to time, we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties or businesses as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity. these transactions also have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. moreover, volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders, unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis presents management's perspective of our business, financial condition and overall performance. this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
overview of 2018 results
2018 was a pivotal year for devon as we took several significant steps toward achieving our long-term strategic goals. operationally, we successfully transitioned our u.s. oil business into full-field development, which resulted in high-return, light-oil production advancing 14 percent in 2018. in addition to this strong operating performance, we made substantial progress high-grading our asset portfolio, building per-share value through our share-repurchase program and reducing our financial leverage by more than 40 percent.
•   increased stack and delaware basin production 27% in 2018 compared to 2017.

•   maintained our 2018 capital expenditure forecast.

•   substantially achieved $5.0 billion in asset sales, including the monetization of enlink and the general partner.

•   repurchased $3.0 billion of common stock, representing a 14% share count reduction since december 31, 2017.

•   reduced long-term debt by $922 million, which is expected to reduce annualized financing costs by $66 million.

•   completed workforce reduction and cost reduction initiatives expected to generate $150 million of annualized savings.

•   increased our quarterly common stock dividend 33% to $0.08 per share beginning in the second quarter of 2018.

•   exited 2018 with $2.4 billion of cash and $2.9 billion of available credit under our senior credit facility and have no significant debt maturities until 2021.

as presented in the graph at the left, our operating achievements are subject to the volatility of commodity prices. over the last four years, nymex wti oil and nymex henry hub prices ranged from an average high of $64.79 per bbl and $3.11 per mmbtu, respectively, to an average low of $43.36 per bbl and $2.46 per mmbtu, respectively. widening western canadian select differentials negatively impacted the prices we realized on our heavy oil production in the fourth quarter of 2018. in the first two months of 2019, western canadian select differentials have improved significantly.

key measures of our financial performance in 2018 are summarized in the following table. increased oil and natural gas liquids prices as well as continued focus cost management improved our 2018 financial performance as compared to 2017, as seen in the table below. additionally, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.6 billion ($2.2 billion after-tax) related to the sale of enlink and the general partner during 2018. more details for these metrics are found within the "results of operations - 2018 vs. 2017" below.

business and industry outlook market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile. therefore, we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell. in 2018, wti oil prices averaged approximately $67/bbl through october, supported by stronger-than-expected oil demand, market management by both opec and non-opec partners and unplanned supply outages. however, oil prices markedly declined in november and december, averaging approximately $53/bbl and reaching as low as $42.53/bbl in december. the deterioration of wti was driven by opec and non-opec partners unwinding their production cut agreement, compounded by rising supply and concerns over slowing global economic growth. western canadian select basis differentials were challenged in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to robust production outpacing local demand, pipeline capacity and rail capacity out of the region. looking ahead, current market fundamentals indicate that 2019 crude pricing is expected to improve from its fourth quarter 2018 levels. additionally, western canadian select differentials are also projected to improve, driven by provincially mandated production cuts combined with takeaway capacity additions expected in late 2019. changes in opec production strategies, the macro-economic environment, geopolitical risks and other factors could impact our current forecasts.
in 2018, devon marked its 30th year as a public company and 47th anniversary in the oil and gas business, so we are experienced in dealing with the volatile nature of commodity prices. to mitigate our exposure to commodity market volatility and ensure our financial strength, we use a disciplined, risk-management hedging program. our hedging program incorporates both systematic hedges added on a regular basis and discretionary hedges layered in on an opportunistic basis to take advantage of favorable market conditions. we have approximately 50% of our anticipated 2019 oil and gas volumes hedged, and we are currently adding hedges for 2020 as well. further insulating our cash flow, we are proactively locking in hedges on the western canadian select basis differential to wti and currently have approximately 50% of our 2019 canadian heavy oil production hedged.
26
index to financial statements despite the uncertainties pertaining to commodity prices, we remain focused on our strategic priorities of having a premier portfolio of assets, delivering superior execution as we drill and operate oil and natural gas wells, and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. 2019 will be an important year for devon as we plan to separate our canadian and barnett shale assets and complete our multi-year transition to a u.s. oil company with operations focused on four core areas in the delaware basin, stack, eagle ford and rockies. with a focused portfolio of u.s. oil assets, we also intend to optimize our cost structure by reducing our annual capital costs, g&a costs, interest expense and production expenses by $780 million in the aggregate by 2021. we expect to deliver 70% of these annualized cost savings in 2019, as the canadian and barnett shale assets are separated, and we align our workforce with the retained business and reduce outstanding debt.
importantly, the portfolio changes and optimized cost performance are expected to enhance our competitive positioning as oil production growth, price realizations, field-level margins and corporate rates-of-return should all improve. with these improved expected outcomes, we remained focused on our 2019 capital allocation priorities of funding our core operations, protecting our investment-grade credit ratings and paying our shareholder dividend. further, when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position, we can achieve all our capital allocation priorities at $46/bbl wti and $3.00/mcf henry hub. should wti drop closer to $40/bbl for an extended period, we would shift our focus to preserving our financial strength and operational continuity. however, as wti rises above $46/bbl, our free cash flow will accelerate, providing additional capital allocation opportunities.

focused development activities in the delaware basin, stack and rockies resulted in an approximate 28% increase in production from those areas compared to 2017. these increases also drove a 17% increase in our u.s. retained oil production. this strong performance led to the overall growth in our retained assets during 2018. production increases from our capital focused assets were partially offset by the effects of facility repairs and other maintenance work at the jackfish facilities, as well as by lower production resulting from our u.s. non-core divestitures.

upstream revenues increased as a result of higher unhedged, realized prices for our u.s. oil and ngls.
the increase in oil sales primarily resulted from higher average wti crude index prices, which were 27% higher in 2018, resulting in an increase of approximately $568 million.
ngl sales increased $351 million as a result of 14% higher ngl prices at the mont belvieu, texas hub, as well as improved realizations in our ngl price.
these increases were partially offset by widening differentials to the wti index for bitumen sales, which negatively impacted our upstream revenues by $406 million. in the fourth quarter of 2018, market forces widened canadian heavy oil differentials beyond historical norms and negatively impacted the price we realized on our canadian production. we had basis swaps for approximately half of our fourth quarter production to mitigate the effect of the lower market price. to further mitigate the effects of the lower price, we reduced our jackfish production in november 2018 which impacted our fourth quarter production by approximately 8 mbbls/d. our canadian heavy oil unhedged realized price for the fourth quarter was near zero. to date in 2019, heavy oil differentials have significantly improved driven by provincially mandated production cuts combined with takeaway capacity additions expected in 2019.
as further discussed in note 1 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report, in 2018 the presentation of certain processing arrangements changed from a net to a gross presentation. the change resulted in an increase to our upstream revenues and production expenses by approximately $254 million with no impact to net earnings.

loe increased $68 million primarily due to continued focus on growing our liquids-rich assets within the stack and delaware basin and higher maintenance costs at our jackfish facilities, partially offset by our u.s. non-core divestitures.
as further discussed in note 1 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report, in 2018 the presentation of certain processing arrangements changed from a net to a gross presentation. the change resulted in an increase to our upstream revenues and production expenses by approximately $254 million with no impact to net earnings.
production taxes increased on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to the increase in our u.s. upstream revenues, on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed. additionally, the increase in oklahoma severance tax rates that became effective during the third quarter of 2018 also contributed to the increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of oil, gas and ngl sales.
property taxes increased as a result of higher property value assessments, primarily on our texas properties, partially offset by our u.s. non-core divestitures.

our oil and gas dd&a increased primarily due to continued development in the stack, delaware basin and rockies properties. the increases were slightly offset by reduced production volumes at the jackfish facilities and from our 2018 u.s. non-core asset divestitures.

labor and benefits decreased primarily as a result of the workforce reduction that occurred during 2018 as discussed in note 6 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report. non-labor costs were higher due to an increase in costs related to automation and process improvements.
financing costs, net

financing costs, net increased $277 million as a result of a $312 million loss on early retirement of debt. for further discussion of early retirement premiums and reduced interest expense resulting from our lower debt balances, see note 15 in

we recognized gains in conjunction with certain of our u.s. asset dispositions in 2017 and 2018. for further discussion, see note 2 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
during 2018, we recognized restructuring and transaction costs of $114 million primarily as a result of our workforce reduction. see note 6 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
the remaining change in other expense was driven primarily by changes on foreign currency exchange instruments as further discussed in note 7 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.

production declines reduced our upstream revenues by $427 million primarily as a result of our u.s. divested assets. retained production volumes decreased due to reduced completion activity in the eagle ford and natural production declines in the barnett shale. these decreases were partially offset by expanded drilling and performance in the stack.

index to financial statements upstream revenues increased $1.4 billion as a result of higher unhedged, realized prices across our entire portfolio. the increase in oil and bitumen sales primarily resulted from higher average wti crude index prices, which were 18% higher in 2017. additionally, our oil and bitumen sales benefited from tighter differentials to the wti index. the increase in gas sales was driven by higher north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based and higher ngl prices at the mont belvieu, texas hub.

loe decreased $100 million primarily due to our u.s. property divestitures in 2016. well optimization and cost reduction initiatives across our portfolio offset industry inflation. these initiatives have been primarily focused on reducing costs associated with water disposal, power and fuel, compression and workovers.
gathering and transportation expense increased $92 million primarily due to a full year of the access pipeline transportation tolls, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 subsequent to the sale of our interest in the pipeline. our access transportation agreement contains a base transportation commitment, which for the initial five years averages $110 million annually.
production taxes increased on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to the increase in our u.s. upstream revenues, on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed.
property taxes decreased as a result of lower property value assessments from the local taxing authorities across our key operating areas and as a result of our u.s. asset divestitures.

our oil and gas dd&a remained relatively flat as compared to the prior year. increases in oil and gas dd&a rates due to continued development in the stack and delaware basin were offset by reduced production volumes resulting from the 2016 u.s. asset divestitures. dd&a from our other property and equipment decreased due to the divestiture of the access pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2016.
financing costs, net

financing costs, net decreased $400 million primarily as a result of our $2.1 billion early debt retirement in 2016. for further discussion of early retirement premiums and reduced interest expense resulting from our lower debt balances, see note 15 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.

operating cash flow - continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2018. our operating cash flow was relatively flat compared to 2017. in 2018, our operating cash flow funded approximately 86% of our capital expenditure program and dividends. we utilized available cash balances and divestiture proceeds to supplement our operating cash flows. operating cash flow for 2018 included a realized foreign exchange loss of $241 million relating to foreign currency denominated intercompany loan activity as described in note 7 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report. there was an offset in the effect of exchange rate and other line in the above table, resulting in no impact to the net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.
our operating cash flow increased $1.4 billion, or 165%, from 2016 to 2017. in 2017, our operating cash flow fully funded our capital expenditures program as well as our dividends. in 2016, our operating cash flow did not fully fund our capital requirements and dividends; as a result, we utilized available cash balances and divestiture proceeds to supplement our operating cash flows.
35
index to financial statements divestitures of property and investments during 2018, as part of our announced divestiture program, we sold non-core u.s. upstream assets for approximately $1.0 billion. for further discussion, see note 2 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
during 2017, as part of our announced divestiture program, we sold non-core u.s. upstream assets for approximately $420 million. for further discussion, see note 2 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
during 2016, we divested certain non-core upstream assets in the u.s. and our 50% interest in the access pipeline in canada for approximately $3.0 billion, net of purchase price adjustments. proceeds from these divestitures were used primarily for debt repayment and to support capital investment in our core resource plays. for further discussion, see note 2 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
we did not have significant current cash income taxes resulting from the divestitures in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations and other corporate activities. the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling and development of oil and gas properties. our capital program is designed to operate within or near operating cash flow and may fluctuate with changes to commodity prices and other factors impacting cash flow. this is evidenced by our operating cash flow funding approximately 91% of capital expenditures in 2018 and fully funding capital expenditures in 2017.
acquisition costs in 2016 primarily consisted of devon's bolt-on acquisition of assets in the stack play for $1.5 billion. approximately $849 million was paid in cash at closing with the remainder of the purchase price funded with equity consideration. see note 2 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report for more information.
debt activity, net during 2018, our debt decreased $922 million due to completed tender offers of certain long-term debt as well as the maturity of certain senior notes. in conjunction with the tender offers, we recognized a $312 million loss on the early retirement of debt, including $304 million of cash retirement costs and fees. for additional information, see note 15 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
during 2016, our debt decreased $3.1 billion due to completed tender offers to purchase and redeem $2.1 billion of debt securities prior to their maturity and a $1 billion reduction in short-term borrowings. in conjunction with the tender offers, we recognized a $269 million loss on the early retirement of debt, including $265 million of cash retirement costs and fees. for additional information, see note 15 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
repurchases of common stock and shareholder distributions in june 2018, in conjunction with the announcement of the divestiture of our investment in enlink and the general partner, our board of directors authorized a $4.0 billion share repurchase program of our common stock. the share repurchase program expires december 31, 2019. as discussed further in note 18 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" in this report, we repurchased 78.1 million shares of common stock for $3.0 billion, or $38.11 per share, under the asr agreement and through open-market share repurchases through december 31, 2018.
36
index to financial statements devon paid common stock dividends of $149 million, $127 million and $221 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. during the second quarter of 2018, we increased our quarterly dividend 33% to $0.08 per share as part of our initiative to return cash to shareholders. our prior quarterly dividend was $0.06 per share subsequent to a reduction from $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2016 due to the depressed commodity price environment. for additional information, see note 18 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
issuance of common stock in february 2016, we issued 79 million shares of our common stock to the public, inclusive of 10 million shares sold as part of the underwriters' option. net proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.5 billion.

cash flows from investing activities for 2018 includes $3.125 billion received from the divestiture of our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner, partially offset by capital expenditures and other items. capital expenditures for enlink's midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of oil and gas gathering facilities and pipelines. during 2017, enlink divested its ownership interest in howard energy partners for approximately $190 million. during 2016, enlink acquired anadarko basin gathering and processing midstream assets for $1.5 billion. approximately $792 million was paid in cash at closing with the remainder of the purchase price funded with equity consideration and debt.
cash flows from financing activities includes common and preferred units enlink issued and sold during 2017 and 2016 generating net proceeds of approximately $501 million and $892 million, respectively. distributions to noncontrolling interests in the table above exclude the distributions enlink and the general partner paid to devon, which have been eliminated in consolidation. distributions enlink and the general partner paid to devon were $134 million, $265 million and $265 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
liquidity the business of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive. because oil, natural gas and ngl reserves are a depleting resource, we, like all upstream operators, must continually make capital investments to grow and even sustain production. generally, our capital investments are focused on drilling and completing new wells and maintaining production from existing wells. at opportunistic times, we also acquire operations and properties from other operators or land owners to enhance our existing portfolio of assets.

index to financial statements historically, our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our operating cash flow, cash on hand and asset divestiture proceeds. additionally, we maintain a commercial paper program, supported by our revolving line of credit, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. if needed, we can also issue debt and equity securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the sec. in february 2019, we also announced plans to separate our canadian and barnett shale assets and operations. we expect to complete these asset separations in 2019. we plan to use the proceeds from these transactions for debt repayments and common share repurchases. we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital requirements as discussed in this section.
operating cash flow key inputs into determining our planned capital investment is the amount of cash we hold and operating cash flow we expect to generate over the next one to three or more years. at the end of 2018, we held approximately $2.4 billion of cash. our operating cash flow forecasts are sensitive to many variables and include a measure of uncertainty as these variables differ from our expectations.
commodity prices - the most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil, bitumen, gas and ngls we produce and sell. prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. these factors, which are difficult to predict, create volatility in prices and are beyond our control. for illustration, our operating cash flow slightly increased in 2018 largely due to 16% growth from our retained u.s. liquids portfolio, as well as 32% higher realized pricing related to these assets. these increases were mostly offset by a significant decrease in our realized price for our bitumen production in 2018. western canadian select basis differentials widened significantly above historical norms due to robust production outpacing local demand, pipeline capacity and rail capacity out of the region. the market fundamentals led our fourth quarter unhedged realized price for bitumen to be near $0 per bbl. in the first two months of 2019, government-mandated production curtailments and current market fundamentals have led to a significant improvement in the western canadian select basis differential.
to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk. we target hedging approximately 50% of our production in a manner that systematically places hedges for several quarters in advance, allowing us to maintain a disciplined risk management program as it relates to commodity price volatility. we supplement the systematic hedging program with discretionary hedges that take advantage of favorable market conditions. we currently have approximately 50% of our anticipated 2019 oil and gas volumes hedged, and we are adding hedges for 2020 as well. further insulating our cash flow, we are proactively locking in hedges on the western canada select basis differential to wti and currently have approximately 50% of our 2019 canadian heavy oil production hedged. the key terms to our oil, gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31, 2018 are presented in note 3 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
further, when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position, we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities at $46/bbl wti and $3.00/mcf henry hub. should wti drop closer to $40/bbl for an extended period, we would shift our focus to preserving our financial strength and operational continuity. however, as wti/bbl rises above $46, our free cash flow will accelerate, providing additional capital allocation opportunities.
operating expenses - commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses. significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities. as a result, the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and materials may also decrease, causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline. however, the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices.
for 2019, we expect to aggressively optimize our cost structure in conjunction with our planned canadian and barnett shale asset divestitures, as we focus on our remaining four u.s. oil plays, align our workforce with the retained business and reduce outstanding debt. we anticipate the planned $780 million reduction of annualized costs will occur over three years, with roughly 70% of the savings delivered by the end of 2019. approximately 40% of the reduced costs relate to our capital programs and the remainder relates to our operating expenses, including g&a, interest expense and production expenses.
credit losses - our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. this includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil, gas and ngl production, the collection of receivables from our joint-interest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts. we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers, partners and counterparties. such mechanisms include, under certain conditions, requiring letters of credit, prepayments or collateral postings.
38
index to financial statements divestitures of property and equipment in the first quarter of 2019, we sold non-core assets for approximately $300 million. we also anticipate separating our canadian and barnett shale businesses from our company in 2019.
credit availability our 2018 senior credit facility, under which we have $2.9 billion of available borrowing capacity at december 31, 2018, matures on october 5, 2023, with the option to extend the maturity date by two additional one-year periods subject to lender consent. the 2018 senior credit facility supports our $3.0 billion of short-term credit under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program. see note 15 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report for further discussion.
the 2018 senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant. this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, of no more than 65%. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with this covenant with a 21.0% debt-to-capitalization ratio.
our access to funds from the 2018 senior credit facility is not restricted under any "material adverse effect" clauses. it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses. these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower's financial condition, operations, properties or business considered as a whole, the borrower's ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement. while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect, the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect.
as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions, liquidity position and other factors, we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt. the amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. furthermore, any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness, which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness.
in january 2019, we repaid the $162 million of 6.30% senior notes at maturity with cash on hand.
debt ratings we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the u.s. in determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and production growth opportunities. our credit rating from standard and poor's financial services is bbb with a stable outlook. our credit rating from fitch is bbb+ with a stable outlook. our credit rating from moody's investor service is ba1 with a positive outlook. any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements.
there are no "rating triggers" in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. however, a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future.
share repurchase program in february 2019, our board of directors increased our share repurchase program by an additional $1 billion. the $5 billion share repurchase program expires december 31, 2019. through february 15, 2019, we have executed $3.4 billion of the authorized program.
39
index to financial statements capital expenditures our 2019 exploration and development budget is expected to be approximately $2.0 billion to $2.25 billion, including capital associated with our canadian and barnett shale upstream assets.

(1)   debt amounts represent scheduled maturities of debt obligations at december 31, 2018, excluding net discounts and debt issue costs included in the carrying value of debt.

(2)   interest expense represents the scheduled cash payments on long-term fixed-rate debt (including current portion of long term debt).

(3)   purchase obligation amounts represent contractual commitments primarily to purchase condensate at market prices for use at our heavy oil projects in canada. we have entered into these agreements because condensate is an integral part of the heavy oil transportation process. any disruption in our ability to obtain condensate could negatively affect our ability to transport heavy oil at these locations. our total obligation related to condensate purchases expires in 2021. the value of the obligation in the table above is based on the contractual volumes and our internal estimate of future condensate market prices.

(4)   operational agreements represent commitments to transport or process certain volumes of oil, gas and ngls for a fixed fee. we have entered into these agreements to aid the movement of our production to downstream markets. approximately $1.9 billion relates to the transportation agreement we entered in 2016 in which we dedicated our thermal-oil acreage to the access pipeline for an initial term of 25 years following the divestment of our 50% interest in the access pipeline. for additional information, see note 2 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.

(5)   asset retirement obligations represent estimated discounted costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation costs. these obligations are recorded as liabilities on our december 31, 2018 balance sheet.

(6)   drilling and facility obligations represent gross contractual agreements with third-party service providers to procure drilling rigs and other related services for developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities construction.

(7)   lease obligations consist primarily of non-cancelable leases for office space and equipment.

(8)   other obligations primarily relate to various tax obligations.

contingencies and legal matters for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters, see note 20 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual amounts could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. we consider the
40
index to financial statements following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
oil and gas assets accounting, classification, reserves & valuation successful efforts method of accounting and classification we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities which requires management's assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as developmental or exploratory. this classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of proved reserves, which is a critical estimate discussed in the section below. the classification of developmental and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or capitalize, then subject to dd&a calculations and impairment assessments and valuations.
once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. development wells are always capitalized. costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. at the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be expensed. when making this determination, management considers current activities, near-term plans for additional exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program. if management determines future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur, the associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the consolidated comprehensive statement of earnings. otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. at december 31, 2018, devon had approximately $200 million of well costs suspended for more than one year, which largely pertain to its pike heavy oil project. stratigraphic testing has demonstrated reserves can be produced economically at pike. however, this capital intensive, long-duration project remains unsanctioned by devon and its 50% partner, which is the primary reason reserves have not been designated as proven at pike. with no lease expiration at pike in the near future, management continues to keep the pike exploratory costs capitalized.
similar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs, costs for undeveloped leasehold, for which reserves have not been proven, must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment. at the end of each quarter, management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans, drilling activity results, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. at december 31, 2018, devon had $1.2 billion of undeveloped leasehold and capitalized interest, which includes approximately $750 million related to pike. consistent with the evaluation above on suspended well costs, the costs for pike continue to remain capitalized. of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at december 31, 2018, approximately $10 million is scheduled to expire in 2019. the leasehold expiring in 2019 relates to areas in which devon is actively drilling. if our drilling is not successful, this leasehold could become partially or entirely impaired.
reserves our estimates of proved and proved developed reserves are a major component of dd&a calculations. additionally, our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments. estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures. the process of estimating oil, gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data. our engineers prepare our reserve estimates. we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by third-party petroleum consulting firms. in 2018, 89% of our reserves were subjected to such audits.
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves, when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information. in the past five years, annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates, which have been both increases and decreases in individual years, have averaged less than 5% of the previous year's estimate. however, there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
valuation of long-lived assets long-lived assets used in operations, including proved and unproved oil and gas properties, are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. for dd&a calculations and impairment assessments, management groups individual
41
index to financial statements assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level ("common operating field") for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. the determination of common operating fields is largely based on geological structural features or stratigraphic condition, which requires judgment. management also considers the nature of production, common infrastructure, common sales points, common processing plants, common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations. these determinations impact the amount of dd&a recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment.
management evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review. besides the estimates of reserves and future production volumes, future commodity prices are the largest driver in the variability of undiscounted pre-tax cash flows. for our impairment determinations, we generally utilize the forward strip prices for the first five years and apply internally generated price forecasts for subsequent years. we estimate and escalate or de-escalate future capital and operating costs by using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history. changes to any of these assumptions could result in lower undiscounted pre-tax cash flows and impact both the recognition and timing of impairments. due to suppressed commodity prices in 2016, we recognized significant asset impairments. with generally higher pricing in 2017 and 2018, we did not recognize material asset impairments.
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually at october 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. as of december 31, 2018, the u.s. reporting unit had goodwill totaling $841 million.
we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if our qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. as part of our qualitative assessment, we considered the general macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, changes in cost factors, actual and expected financial performance, significant changes in management, strategy or customers, and stock performance. if the qualitative assessment determines that a quantitative goodwill impairment test is required, then the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units are estimated based upon several valuation analyses, including comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid. the determination of fair value requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions.
based on our qualitative assessment as of october 31, 2018, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the u.s. reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. since our annual test for goodwill impairment on october 31, 2018 was performed, our stock price decreased 30% from october 31 to december 31. as such, we performed an updated assessment as of december 31, 2018 to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. based on our qualitative assessment as of december 31, 2018, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the u.s. reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
our impairment determinations involved significant assumptions and judgments, as discussed above. differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. if actual future results are not consistent with these assumptions and estimates, or the assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges, which would be recognized in the period in which we would determine that the carrying value exceeds fair value. we would expect that a prolonged or sustained period of lower commodity prices would adversely affect the estimate of future operating results, which could result in future goodwill impairments for our u.s. reporting unit due to the potential impact on the cash flows of our operations.
42
index to financial statements the impairment of goodwill has no effect on liquidity or capital resources. however, it adversely affects our results of operations in the period recognized.
income taxes the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions. we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates. we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and establish accruals for such amounts. we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and other tax carryforwards. we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. at the end of 2017, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets. upon closing the enlink divestiture in the third quarter of 2018, devon reassessed its position and determined that its u.s. segment is no longer in a full valuation allowance position, maintaining only valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets, including certain tax credits and state net operating losses. devon also has recorded a partial valuation allowance against certain canadian deferred tax assets that were generated by a 2017 canadian legal entity restructuring.
the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management. these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change. material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.
we also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. these factors include forecasted and actual results for both our u.s. and canadian operations, borrowing conditions in the u.s. and existing u.s. income tax laws. changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional deferred, or even current, u.s. income tax expense. we accrue deferred u.s. income tax expense on our foreign earnings when the factors indicate that these earnings are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested.
for our foreign earnings deemed indefinitely reinvested, we do not calculate a hypothetical deferred tax liability on these earnings. calculating a hypothetical tax on these accumulated earnings is much different from the calculation of the deferred tax liability on our earnings deemed not indefinitely reinvested. a hypothetical tax calculation on the indefinitely reinvested earnings would require the following additional activities:
•   relying on tax rates on a future remittance that could vary significantly depending on alternative approaches available to repatriate the earnings;

•   determining the nature of a yet-to-be-determined future remittance, such as whether the distribution would be a non-taxable return of capital or a distribution of taxable earnings and calculation of associated withholding taxes, which would vary significantly depending on the circumstances at the deemed time of remittance; and

•   further analysis of a variety of other inputs such as the earnings and profits, u.s./foreign country tax treaty provisions and the related foreign taxes paid by our foreign subsidiaries, whose earnings are deemed permanently reinvested, over a lengthy history of operations.

because of the administrative burden required to perform these additional activities, it is impractical to calculate a hypothetical tax on the foreign earnings associated with this separate and more complicated chain of companies.
43
index to financial statements non-gaap measures core earnings we make reference to "core earnings (loss) attributable to devon" and "core earnings (loss) per share attributable to devon" in "overview of 2018 results" in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap. these non-gaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap measures. core earnings (loss) attributable to devon, as well as the per share amount, represent net earnings excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results. additionally, we've presented our discontinued operations associated with the sale of our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner separately to show our results on a go-forward basis. for more information on the results of operations for enlink and the general partner, see note 19 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" in this report. our non-gaap measures are typically used as a performance measure. amounts excluded for 2018 relate to asset dispositions, the gain on the sale of devon's aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner, noncash asset impairments including noncash unproved asset impairments, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, costs associated with early retirement of debt, fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency, restructuring and transaction costs associated with the 2018 workforce reduction and settlements relating to minimum volume contract commitments.
amounts excluded for 2017 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments including noncash unproved asset impairments, u.s. tax reform changes, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes, legal entity restructuring and costs associated with early retirement of debt.
amounts excluded for 2016 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including an impairment of enlink goodwill) including noncash unproved asset impairments and dry hole costs relating to exploration expenses, rig stacking costs, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, restructuring and transaction costs associated with the 2016 workforce reduction, derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes and costs associated with early retirement of debt.
we believe these non-gaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts, which typically make similar adjustments in their estimates of our financial results. we also believe these non-gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers.

index to financial statements ebitdax and field-level cash margin to assess the performance of our assets, we use ebitdax and field-level cash margin. we compute ebitdax as net earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense; financing costs, net; exploration expenses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; asset impairments; asset disposition gains and losses; non-cash share-based compensation; non-cash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments; restructuring and transaction costs; accretion on discounted liabilities; and other items not related to our normal operations. field-level cash margin is computed as oil, gas and ngl revenues less production expenses. production expenses consist of lease operating, gathering, processing and transportation expenses, as well as production and property taxes.
we exclude financing costs from ebitdax to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from ebitdax because they are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. dd&a and impairments are excluded from ebitdax because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. we exclude share-based compensation, valuation changes, restructuring and transaction costs, accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from ebitdax because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance.
we believe ebitdax and field-level cash margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods. ebitdax and field-level cash margin as defined by devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from continuing operations.
below are reconciliations of net earnings from continuing operations to ebitdax and a further reconciliation to field-level cash margin. because we have sold upstream assets in the periods presented and have plans to dispose our canadian and barnett shale businesses, which represent approximately 40% of our 2018 production volumes, we have also excluded the ebitdax and field-level cash margin for our divested assets, canada and the barnett shale to compute adjusted ebitdax and adjusted field-level cash margin. we use adjusted ebitdax and adjusted field-level cash margin to assess the performance of our portfolio of upstream assets on a "same-store" basis across periods.

item 1a. risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements the information in this report includes forward-looking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues, expenses and business opportunities. generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate" and "plan" or similar expressions. in particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry, including those under "outlook," are forward-looking statements. they reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date of this report. except as required by law, we do not undertake to update them. our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors, as well as elsewhere in our filings with the sec. if any of these considerations or risks materialize, our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected.
if we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, including under the velocity growth plan, we may not be able to increase operating income.
to drive operating income growth, our business strategies must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal, delivering sustainable guest count growth and driving a higher average check. whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our system's ability to:
•   continue to innovate and differentiate the mcdonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;
•   capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to enhance our ability to retain, regain and convert key customer groups;
•   utilize our new organizational structure to build on our progress and execute against our business strategies;
•   augment our digital and delivery initiatives, including mobile ordering, along with experience of the future ("eotf"), particularly in the u.s.;
•   identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of systemwide restaurants;
mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report
•   operate restaurants with high service levels and optimal capacity while managing the increasing complexity of our restaurant operations and create efficiencies through innovative use of technology; and
•   accelerate our existing strategies through growth opportunities, investments and partnerships.
if we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected returns.
our long-term business objectives depend on the successful systemwide execution of our strategies. we continue to build upon our investments in eotf, which focus on restaurant modernization and technology, as well as digital engagement and delivery, in order to transform the customer experience. as part of these investments, we are placing renewed emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, as well as mobile ordering and payment systems. we also continue to refine our delivery initiatives and partnerships, which may not generate expected returns. if these initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.
if we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.
our continued success depends on our system's ability to retain, regain and convert customers. in order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics, and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings and consumer preferences in the "informal eating out" ("ieo") segment. if we are not able to quickly and effectively respond to these changes, or our competitors respond more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
our ability to retain, regain and convert customers also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the system, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. existing or future pricing strategies, and the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy; however, they may not be successful in retaining, regaining and converting customers, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, and could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.
additionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in retaining, regaining and converting customers. our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels allows us to reach our customers effectively. if the advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.
failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions. those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. for example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the ieo segment or perceptions of our brand generally or relative to available alternatives. consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the ieo segment, our brand, our operations, our suppliers or our franchisees. if we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary, whether or not accurate, our brand and our financial results may suffer.
additionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives, which require systemwide coordination and alignment. if we are not effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. in particular, business incidents or practices whether actual or perceived, that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents or practices receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.
we face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.
we compete primarily in the ieo segment, which is highly competitive. we also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores and coffee shops. we expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by new or continuing actions of our competitors, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.
we compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. in particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, develop new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or disruptive actions from others which we do not foresee. there can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics, which could have the overall effect of harming our business.
mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.
our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity, stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. sustained adverse economic conditions or periodic adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer.
our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and unfavorable currency fluctuations could adversely affect reported earnings.
supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.
we depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products on favorable terms. although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. supply chain interruptions, including shortages and transportation issues, and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers, franchisees or us. if we experience interruptions in our system's supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our system's operations.
food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.
our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our system's ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald's of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future. food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to offer safe food products to our customers, including as our menu and service model evolve. however, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, occur within the food industry and our system from time to time and, in addition, could occur in the future. instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits.
our franchise business model presents a number of risks.
as the company's business model has evolved to a more heavily franchised structure, our success relies to large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from company-operated restaurants. our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. the revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. if our franchisees do not experience sales growth, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures, or delayed or reduced payments to us.
our success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. the ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the company or by banks' lending practices. if our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.
our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.
our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. the benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depends on various factors including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.
challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business.
effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. failure to effectively identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and facilitate smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.
mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report challenges with respect to labor availability and cost could impact our business and results of operations.
our success depends in part on our system's ability to proactively recruit, motivate and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our company-operated restaurants could have a negative impact on our company-operated margins. similar concerns apply to our franchisees.
we are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with u.s. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our company-operated restaurants. these regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. claims of non-compliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to us. our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the mcdonald's system and whose performance may have a material impact on our results.
information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may impact our operations.
we are increasingly reliant on technological systems, such as point-of-sale and other systems or platforms, technologies supporting mcdonald's digital and delivery solutions, as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally, with affiliated entities, customers, employees or independent third parties to conduct our business, including technology-enabled systems provided to us by third parties. any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer experience and perceptions.
despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. our increasing reliance on third party systems also present the risks faced by the third party's business, including the operational, security and credit risks of those parties. if those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our operations.
furthermore, security breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with (including franchisees), or those of third party providers. these may include such things as unauthorized access, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. our information technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers, our employees and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. an actual or alleged security breach could result in disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of personal, financial, proprietary or other confidential information. further, the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") requires entities processing the personal data of individuals in the european union to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of that data. failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in substantial penalties and materially adversely impact our financial results. the occurrence of any of these incidents could result in reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including criminal penalties or civil liabilities.
the global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.
we encounter differing cultural, regulatory and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where mcdonald's restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the system's success in these environments. meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our system's ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with mcdonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.
disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our franchisees' or our suppliers' operations, and asset seizures. the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries, whether or not they have merit, or the impact of these other measures, may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental investigations or inquiries.
additionally, challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. an inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
we may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. for example, as a result of the u.k.'s decision to leave the european union through a negotiated exit over a period of time, including its formal commencement of exit proceedings, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, as well as potential referenda in the u.k. and/or other european countries, that could cause uncertainty in european or worldwide economic conditions. the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may not continue. any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. in particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations. we are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities inside and outside of the u.s. in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
the profitability of our company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supplies, fuel, utilities and distribution, and other operating costs, including labor. any volatility in certain commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. the commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results.
our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. in many of our markets, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. we are affected by the cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.
our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans and operations. these regulations include product packaging, marketing, the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers (particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure).
additionally, we are working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources. these risks include the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. these risks could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
we are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us.
increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. we could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations and proceedings, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party's trademarks, copyrights or patents). regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management's attention away from operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to regulatory proceedings or litigation.
litigation and regulatory action concerning our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business operations and the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions.
we are also subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability, such as in the areas of privacy and data collection, protection and management, as it relates to information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to business partners, customers, employees or other third parties.
our results could also be affected by the following:
•   the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings;
•   the cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products;
•   adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and
•   the scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have.
mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report a judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. further, adverse publicity resulting from claims may hurt our business.
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately confirm we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the mcdonald's brand and our business.
the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.
we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. the trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the u.s. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the u.s. and foreign countries may not be adequate. in addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately confirm that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. in particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.
we cannot guarantee that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.
changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results.
new accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. we may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. in assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. these estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends, and our restructuring activities. if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. if we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.
a decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability.
our credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. as a result, our interest expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants.
our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. if any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.
many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. the most important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
•   the unpredictable nature of global economic and market conditions;
•   governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the u.s., which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;
•   trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which mcdonald's may be included, such as the s&amp;p 500 index and the dow jones industrial average;
•   the impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and
•   the impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as those we may take from time to time as we implement our strategies in light of changing business, legal and tax considerations and evolve our corporate structure.
mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects.
severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company operates and franchises mcdonald's restaurants. of the 37,855 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2018, 35,085 were franchised.
under mcdonald's conventional franchise arrangement, the company generally owns the land and building or secures a long-term lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and décor. the company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry.
franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. in addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the company frequently co-invests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems. these investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance, and increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants.
under mcdonald's developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the company generally has no capital invested. the company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliates (primarily in china and japan).
mcdonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of mcdonald's global brand, operating system and financial resources.
directly operating mcdonald's restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. one of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from operating company-owned restaurants allows mcdonald's to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. having company-owned and operated restaurants provides company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. in addition, in our company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit mcdonald's restaurants. mcdonald's continually reviews its mix of company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term.
the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. revenues from developmental licensees and affiliate restaurants include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license. fees vary by type of site, amount of company investment, if any, and local business conditions. these fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.
through the end of 2018, the business was structured into the following segments that combined markets with similar characteristics and ownership structure, and reflected how management reviewed and evaluated operating performance:
•   u.s. - the company's largest segment.
•   international lead markets - established markets including australia, canada, france, germany, the u.k. and related markets.
•   high growth markets - markets that the company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including china, italy, korea, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain, switzerland and related markets.
•   foundational markets &amp; corporate - the remaining markets in the mcdonald's system, most of which operate under a largely franchised model. corporate activities are also reported within this segment.
beginning in 2019, the company changed its global operating structure as detailed in the company's form 8-k filed with the sec on september 24, 2018. refer to the strategic direction and financial performance section on the next page for additional information as well as the segment and geographic information section included in part ii, item 8, page 49 of this form 10-k.
management's view of the business in analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-gaap, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital ("roiic"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below.
•   constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the company believes this better represents its underlying business trends.
•   comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the company's initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation, and, beginning in 2017, also exclude sales from venezuela due to its hyper-inflation. management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. the goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check.
•   systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. while franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.
•   roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. the calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.
•   free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment among the company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the "system") is key to mcdonald's long-term success. by leveraging the system, mcdonald's is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. mcdonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of system alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities.
in 2018, the company continued to evolve to a more heavily franchised business model, and is currently about 93% franchised, with a long-term goal of approximately 95%. the company will continue to make progress toward this long-term goal in 2019 primarily by refranchising restaurants to conventional licensees. as a result of the continued evolution of the company's business model, in september 2018, the company announced several organizational changes to its global business structure. these changes are designed to continue the company's efforts toward efficiently driving growth as a better mcdonald's through the velocity growth plan. effective january 1, 2019, mcdonald's is operating with the following global business segments:
•   u.s., the company's largest market.
•   international operated markets (iom), comprised of wholly-owned markets, or countries in which the company operates restaurants, including australia, canada, france, germany, italy, the netherlands, russia, spain and the u.k.
•   international developmental licensed markets (idl), comprised primarily of developmental licensee and affiliate markets in the mcdonald's system. corporate activities will also be reported within this segment.
australia, canada, france, germany, and the u.k. may be collectively referred to as "the big five international markets" in the company's disclosures.
customer-centric growth strategy the velocity growth plan (the "plan"), the company's customer-centric strategy, is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, along with a deep understanding of the key drivers of the business. the plan is designed to drive sustainable guest count growth, which is a reliable long-term measure of the company's strength and is vital to growing sales and shareholder value. 2018 was a year of broad-based strength around the world along with significant execution against the plan in the u.s. while the company made meaningful progress, our focus in 2019 will be to optimize execution of the plan to unlock further potential and drive long-term sustainable growth.
the company continues to target the opportunity at the core of its business - its food, value and customer experience. the strategy is built on the following three pillars, all focusing on building a better mcdonald's:
•   retaining existing customers - focusing on areas where it already has a strong foothold in the ieo category, including family occasions and food-led breakfast.
•   regaining customers who visit less often - recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely food taste and quality, convenience and value.
•   converting casual to committed customers - building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the mccafé coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings.
in each pillar, mcdonald's has established sustainable platforms that enable execution of the plan with greater speed, efficiency and impact while remaining relentlessly focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. additionally, through three identified growth accelerators - experience of the future ("eotf"), digital and delivery - mcdonald's is enhancing the overall customer experience with hospitable, friendly service and ever-improving convenience for customers on their terms. the company worked to aggressively deploy each of these accelerators in 2018 and will continue further implementation in 2019 and beyond.
mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report
•   experience of the future. the company continues to build upon its investments in eotf, focusing on restaurant modernization and technology in order to transform the restaurant service experience and enhance the brand in the eyes of our customers. eotf introduces a new hospitality experience via the restaurant guest experience leaders and table service, both of which have proven to be critical drivers of customer satisfaction. the modernization efforts are designed to provide a better customer experience, leading to increased frequency of customer visits along with higher average check. as of the end of 2018, eotf is now deployed in about half of the restaurants in our global system, and in 2019, the company will continue to deploy eotf in many markets. in 2018, the u.s. converted about 4,500 restaurants to eotf, exceeding its ambitious target of 4,000 restaurants, resulting in over half of the u.s. restaurants now having eotf. we expect to convert substantially all of the restaurants in the u.s. to eotf by the end of 2020.
•   digital. as the company continues its ambitious pace of converting restaurants to eotf, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. by evolving the technology platform, the company is redefining how we provide convenience to customers by expanding choices for how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks, and technologies that enable conveniences such as table service and curb-side pick-up. in 2018, the company made further progress in rolling out digital platforms to improve convenience for our customers and provide a simpler and more personalized experience. this included having kiosks deployed in nearly 17,000 restaurants, digital menu boards in more than 21,000 restaurants, and availability of mobile order &amp; pay in over 22,000 restaurants. the popularity and utilization of self-order kiosks continues to grow over time, and in france, italy and spain, well over half of all in-restaurant visits orders are placed through the kiosk. germany made a strong push to grow digital engagement in 2018 through digital calendar promotions, and saw success, driving sales and guest count growth, as well as increased app downloads. in 2019, the company will continue to utilize digital initiatives to engage customers, grow awareness and adoption of digital offerings, and support our menu offerings.
•   delivery. the company continues to build momentum with its delivery platform as a way of expanding the convenience for its customers. in 2018, mcdonald's expanded the number of restaurants offering delivery and it is now available in over half of the global system. customers are responding positively, as demonstrated by high satisfaction ratings, high reorder rates, and average checks that are 1.5-2 times higher than average non-delivery transactions. in addition, many of our larger markets, such as the u.s., france and the u.k., have achieved delivery sales growth in the high double digits in restaurants offering the service for more than 12 months. further, in several of our top markets, delivery now represents as much as 10% of sales in those restaurants offering delivery. while growing customer awareness remains a priority and focus in 2019, we have been effective in markets like australia, where awareness has more than doubled through a major campaign that promoted delivery with in-restaurant signs, engaging social media outreach, public relations activity and advertising.
the velocity growth plan is a global strategy that is tailored at a market level to allow for the best customer experience and most convenience for our valued customers. while the plan provides a consistent framework on how to retain, regain, and convert customers, the execution varies across the globe. markets continue to make progress on the three pillars of the plan and its growth accelerators. the u.s., for example, remains diligently focused on driving guest count growth in 2019 through actions that collectively transform the customer experience. in addition to continuing its aggressive execution of the growth accelerators of eotf, digital and delivery, the u.s. will also enhance the customer experience through strong restaurant execution, with a focus on the drive thru experience, and reducing complexity in the restaurants. in 2018, several markets, including key markets outside of the u.s., experienced strong business results, driven by the velocity growth plan, and the markets will continue to hone their execution of the plan in 2019, focusing on value, quality and convenience.
our plan also includes the company further embedding actions in response to certain social and environmental issues into the core of our business, which we refer to as using our scale for good. as one of the world's largest restaurant companies, our scale for good highlights our commitment to global priorities that are consistent with our strategic priorities and provides an opportunity to collaborate with our franchisees and suppliers to drive meaningful progress. we recognize that our success in advancing each of the pillars within our strategy will be demonstrated as customers continue to feel good about visiting mcdonald's restaurants and eating our food.
while we're committed to working to address many challenges facing society today, we are elevating a few global priorities where we believe we can make the greatest difference in driving industry-wide change. our four global priorities reflect the social and environmental impacts of our food and our business and are: beef sustainability, packaging and recycling, commitment to families and our investment in people. in 2018, the company demonstrated its dedication to these priorities, pledging commitments related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the use of antibiotics, sourcing sustainable packaging, and making a difference for families through our food offerings, reading programs and ronald mcdonald house charities.
the company is confident that, with the velocity growth plan in place, the system will work together in 2019 to focus on improving the taste of our delicious food, enhancing convenience, offering compelling value and upholding the trust consumers place in our brand, which we believe will enhance our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report
2018 financial performance the company's 2018 financial performance continued to demonstrate that the velocity growth plan is working. by focusing on the aforementioned three pillars, and the identified growth accelerators, the company has achieved 14 consecutive quarters of positive global comparable sales. in 2018, global comparable sales increased 4.5% and global comparable guest counts increased 0.2%.
•   comparable sales in the u.s. increased 2.5% and comparable guest counts decreased 2.2%. the increase in comparable sales was driven by growth in average check resulting from both product mix shifts and menu price increases.
•   comparable sales in the international lead segment increased 5.8% and comparable guest counts increased 2.4%, reflecting positive results across all markets.
•   comparable sales in the high growth segment increased 4.1% and comparable guest counts increased 1.8%. this performance reflects positive results across most of the segment, led by strong performance in italy and the netherlands.
•   comparable sales in the foundational markets increased 7.1% and comparable guest counts increased 1.5%, reflecting positive sales performance in japan and across all geographic regions.
in addition to improved comparable sales and consolidated guest count performance, the company achieved the following financial results in 2018:
•   due to the impact of the company's strategic refranchising initiative, consolidated revenues decreased 8% (8% in constant currencies).
•   systemwide sales increased 6% (6% in constant currencies).
•   consolidated operating income decreased 8% (8% in constant currencies). 2018 results included non-cash impairment and strategic restructuring charges. 2017 results reflected a gain on the sale of the company's businesses in china and hong kong, partly offset by restructuring and impairment charges. excluding these items in both years, consolidated operating income increased 2% (2% in constant currencies).
•   operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 41.9% in 2017 to 42.0% in 2018. excluding the items described in the previous bullet point, operating margin increased from 38.8% in 2017 to 43.1% in 2018.
•   diluted earnings per share of $7.54 increased 18% (18% in constant currencies). refer to the net income and diluted earnings per share section on page 21 for additional details.
•   cash provided by operations was $6.97 billion.
•   capital expenditures of $2.74 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings.
•   free cash flow was $4.23 billion.
•   across the system, about 1,100 restaurants (including those in our developmental licensee and affiliated markets) were opened.
•   one-year roiic was (80.4%) and three-year roiic was 78.0% for the period ended december 31, 2018. excluding the gain from the sale of businesses in china and hong kong, as well as significant investing cash inflows from strategic refranchising initiatives, one year and three year roiic were 10.2% and 34.7%, respectively (see reconciliation in exhibit 12).
•   the company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 15% to $1.16 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $4.64 per share.
•   the company returned $8.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the year and increased the cash return to shareholder target for the 3-year period ending 2019 to about $25 billion.
outlook
2019 outlook the following information is provided to assist in forecasting the company's future results.
•   changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales, net restaurant unit expansion and the potential impacts of hyper-inflation. the company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2019 systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies).
•   the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. however, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the u.s. or the new international operated markets segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 6 to 7 cents.
•   with about 75% of mcdonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the company's commodity costs. for the full year 2019, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 1% to 2% in the u.s. and about 2% in the big five international markets.
•   the company expects full year 2019 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 4% in constant currencies.
mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report
•   based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the company expects interest expense for the full year 2019 to increase about 10% to 12% due primarily to higher average debt balances.
•   a significant part of the company's operating income is generated outside the u.s., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, british pound, australian dollar and canadian dollar. collectively, these currencies represent approximately 80% of the company's operating income outside the u.s. if all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 35 cents.
•   the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2019 to be in the 24% to 26% range. some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range. primarily due to tax costs associated with new regulations issued in january 2019, the effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be in the 28% to 29% range.
•   the company expects capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $2.3 billion. about $1.5 billion will be dedicated to our u.s. business, nearly two-thirds of which is allocated to approximately 2,000 eotf projects. globally, we expect to open roughly 1,200 restaurants. we will spend approximately $600 million in our wholly owned markets to open 300 restaurants and our developmental licensee and affiliated markets will contribute capital toward the remaining 900 restaurant openings in their respective markets. the company expects about 750 net restaurant additions in 2019.
•   during 2019, the company expects to return about $9 billion to shareholders, which will complete its cash return to shareholder target of about $25 billion for the 3-year period ending 2019.
long-term outlook
•   over the long-term, the company expects to achieve the following average annual (constant currency) financial targets:
◦   systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%;
◦   operating margin in the mid-40% range;
◦   earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and
◦   return on incremental invested capital in the mid-20% range.

results in 2018 reflected a lower effective tax rate, and stronger operating performance due to an increase in sales-driven franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower company-operated margin dollars due to the impact of refranchising. results in 2017 reflected stronger operating performance, g&a savings, improved performance in japan, and the benefit of a reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in japan.
included in the full year 2018 results were:
◦   approximately $140 million, or $0.17 per share, of non-cash impairment charges;
◦   pre-tax strategic restructuring charges of $94 million, or $0.09 per share (of which $85 million relates to the restructuring of the u.s. business); and
◦   approximately $75 million, or $0.10 per share, of net tax cost associated with 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in the prior year under the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act").
included in the full year 2017 results were:
◦   approximately $700 million, or $0.82 per share, of net tax cost associated with the tax act; and
◦   a pre-tax gain of approximately $850 million on the sale of the company's businesses in china and hong kong, offset in part by $150 million of restructuring and impairment charges in connection with the company's global g&amp;a and refranchising initiatives, for a net benefit of $0.53 per share.
excluding these 2018 and 2017 items, 2018 net income was $6.2 billion, an increase of 14% (14% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share was $7.90, an increase of 19% (18% in constant currencies). excluding items impacting 2017 and the 2016 strategic charges of $342 million, 2017 net income was $5.4 billion, an increase of 10% (10% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share was $6.66, an increase of 16% (16% in constant currencies).
the company repurchased 32.2 million shares of its stock for $5.2 billion in 2018 and 31.4 million shares of its stock for $4.6 billion in 2017, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share.
revenues the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.
the company has continually reviewed its mix of company-owned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term. franchised restaurants represent approximately 93% of mcdonald's restaurants worldwide at december 31, 2018. although refranchising allows the company to generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams while operating with a less resource-intensive structure, the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as company-operated sales are replaced by franchised revenues, where the company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales.
effective january 1, 2018, the company adopted the guidance issued in accounting standards codification 606, "revenue recognition - revenue from contracts with customers." this standard changed the way initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings and new franchise terms are recognized. under the new guidance, initial franchise fees are being recognized evenly over the franchise term rather than immediately upon receipt. revenues for 2018 reflected a negative impact of approximately $42 million as a result of this new guidance.
in 2018, revenues decreased 8% (8% in constant currencies) and in 2017, revenues decreased 7% (8% in constant currencies). for both periods, the decreases in revenues were due to the company's strategic refranchising initiatives, partly offset by positive comparable sales.

franchised margins franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company's costs associated with those restaurants, primarily occupancy costs (rent and depreciation). franchised margin dollars represented about 85% of the combined restaurant margins in 2018, about 80% in 2017, and about 75% in 2016.
in 2018, franchised margin dollars increased $727 million or 9% (8% in constant currencies). in 2017, franchised margin dollars increased $703 million or 9% (9% in constant currencies). for both 2018 and 2017, the constant currency increases were due to positive comparable sales performance across all segments, refranchising and expansion.

•   u.s.: in 2018 and 2017, the decreases in the franchised margin percents were primarily due to higher depreciation costs related to investments in eotf, partly offset by positive comparable sales.
•   international lead markets: in 2018 and 2017, the increases in the franchised margin percent primarily reflected the benefit from positive comparable sales performance, partly offset by the impact of refranchising and higher occupancy costs.
•   high growth markets: in 2018 and 2017, the increases in the franchised margin percents were primarily due to the impact of refranchising, mainly related to the sale of the company's businesses in china and hong kong in 2017, as well as strong comparable sales performance.
the franchised margin percent in foundational markets & corporate is higher relative to the other segments due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and affiliated restaurants where the company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs.

foreign currency and hedging activity includes net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign currency cash flow streams.
provision for income taxes in 2018, 2017 and 2016, the reported effective income tax rates were 24.2%, 39.4% and 31.7%, respectively.
the effective income tax rate for 2018 reflected approximately $75 million of net tax cost associated with the 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in the prior year under the tax act. excluding the impact of the tax act and the current year impairment charges, the effective income tax rate was 22.9% for 2018. excluding the prior year provisional net tax cost of approximately $700 million under the tax act, the effective income tax rate was 31.6% for 2017.
excluding the impact of the tax act and the current year impairment charges, the lower effective income tax rate for 2018 reflected the reduction in the u.s. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2018. in addition, both 2018 and 2017 reflected a benefit from a change in tax reserves as a result of global audit progression.
consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $2.0 billion in 2018 and $1.5 billion in 2017. substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the u.s. and other profitable markets.
recently issued accounting standards recently issued accounting standards are included in part ii, item 8, page 37 of this form 10-k.
cash flows the company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.
cash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion in 2018, an increase in free cash flow of $528 million or 14% compared with 2017. cash provided by operations totaled $5.6 billion and free cash flow was $3.7 billion in 2017. the company's free cash flow conversion rate was 71% in 2018 and 2017 (see reconciliation in exhibit 12). in 2018, cash provided by operations increased by $1.4 billion or 25% compared with 2017, primarily due to lower tax payments. in 2017, cash provided by operations decreased by $508 million or 8% compared with 2016, as improved operating results were more than offset by higher income tax payments in the u.s. and other working capital changes.
cash used for investing activities totaled $2.5 billion in 2018, an increase of $3 billion compared with 2017. the increase was primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of restaurant businesses in 2018, as well as higher capital expenditures. cash provided by investing activities totaled $562 million in 2017, an increase of $1.5 billion compared with 2016. the increase was primarily due to proceeds associated with the sale of the company's businesses in china and hong kong.
cash used for financing activities totaled $5.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $639 million compared with 2017, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases. cash used for financing activities totaled $5.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of $6 billion compared with 2016, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by a decrease in net borrowings.
the company's cash and equivalents balance was $866 million and $2.5 billion at year end 2018 and 2017, respectively. in addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.
restaurant development and capital expenditures in 2018, the company opened 1,081 restaurants and closed 467 restaurants. in 2017, the company opened 929 restaurants and closed 587 restaurants. the company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

approximately 93% of the restaurants at year-end 2018 were franchised, including 95% in the u.s., 88% in international lead markets, 83% in high growth markets and 98% in foundational markets.
capital expenditures increased $888 million or 48% in 2018, primarily due to reinvestment in existing restaurants (including investment in eotf). capital expenditures were relatively flat in 2017 as higher expenditures on restaurant reinvestment were offset by fewer restaurant openings that required the company's capital. under mcdonald's developmental licensee and affiliate arrangements, licensees provide capital for the entire business and the company generally has no capital invested.
capital expenditures invested in the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets represented over 90% of the total in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

(1)   primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures new restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. these costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, as well as leveraging the company's global sourcing network and best practices. although the company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs for new traditional mcdonald's restaurants in the u.s. averaged approximately $3.8 million in 2018.
the company owned approximately 50% of the land and approximately 80% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2018 and 2017.
share repurchases and dividends in 2018, the company returned approximately $8.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. this brings the cumulative two-year return to shareholders to $16.2 billion toward our targeted return of about $25 billion for the three-year period ending 2019.

in july 2017, the company's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the company's outstanding stock, with no specified expiration date. in 2018, approximately 32.2 million shares were repurchased for $5.2 billion, bringing total purchases under the program to approximately 49.5 million shares or $7.9 billion.
the company has paid dividends on its common stock for 43 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. the 2018 full year dividend of $4.19 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $1.01 per share, with an increase to $1.16 per share paid in the fourth quarter. this 15% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $4.64 per share annual dividend and reflects the company's confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. as in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the company's board of directors.
financial position and capital resources total assets total assets decreased $1.0 billion or 3% in 2018 primarily due to a decrease in cash and equivalents and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partly offset by an increase in accounts and notes receivable due to the significant number of eotf projects and corresponding billings to franchisees for their portion of the reinvestment. net property and equipment increased $394.4 million in 2018, primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange rates. net property and equipment represented about 70% of total assets at year-end. approximately 96% of total assets were in the u.s., international lead markets, and high growth markets at year-end 2018.

standard & poor's and moody's currently rate, with a stable outlook, the company's commercial paper a-2 and p-2, respectively; and its long-term debt bbb+ and baa1, respectively. to access the debt capital markets, the company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings.
certain of the company's debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. there are no provisions in the company's debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company's business. under existing authorization from the company's board of directors, the company has $15.0 billion of authority to borrow funds, of which $6.5 billion remains outstanding as of december 31, 2018. these borrowings may include (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. in addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the sec and a global medium-term notes program, the company has $3.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the u.s. and global markets (see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). in 2019, the company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance $2.1 billion of maturing corporate debt. as of december 31, 2018, the company's subsidiaries also had $254 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.
the company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements. the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. all swaps are over-the-counter instruments.
in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders' equity. total foreign currency-denominated debt was $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. in addition, where practical, the company's restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. see the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. at december 31, 2018, the company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions. the company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.
the company's net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. the company's largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:
foreign currency net asset exposures in millions of u.s. dollars        2018            2017
british pounds sterling          $1,840          $1,877

japanese yen                        407             589
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company's results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report 28
each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the u.s. dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company's anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. based on the results of these analyses of the company's financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2018 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2018 levels would materially affect the company's results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.
liquidity the company has significant operations outside the u.s. where we earn about 65% of our operating income. a significant portion of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations.
the company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $708 million as of december 31, 2018.
consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, repatriation of a portion of foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing and financing activities.
in the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the u.s. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions.
contractual obligations and commitments the company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. in addition, the company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the company's borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. the following table summarizes the company's contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31, 2018. see discussions of cash flows, financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

in the u.s., the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service ("irs") limitations. at december 31, 2018, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $437 million.
at december 31, 2018, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.3 billion. in addition, a liability of approximately $757 million remains resulting from the tax act, which imposed a deemed repatriation tax on the company's undistributed foreign earnings. this additional tax liability will be paid over the next eight years. refer to the income taxes footnote on page 45 for additional information.
there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business.  such commitments are generally shorter term in nature, will be funded from operating cash flows, and are not significant to the company's overall financial position.
other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates.
mcdonald's corporation 2018 annual report the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to confirm that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. the company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
•   property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management's estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.
•   share-based compensation the company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ("rsus") to employees and nonemployee directors. the expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. the company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period.
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. the pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company's stock at date of grant, and prior to 2018 included a reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. for performance-based rsus granted beginning in 2016, the company includes a relative total shareholder return ("tsr") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. the fair value of performance-based rsus that include the tsr modifier is determined using a monte carlo valuation model.
•   long-lived assets impairment review long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. in assessing the recoverability of the company's long-lived assets, the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company's experience and knowledge of its operations. these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. if the company's estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to record impairment charges. based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual market) with risk of material goodwill impairment.
•   litigation accruals in the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. a determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

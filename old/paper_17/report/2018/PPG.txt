item 1a. risk factors as a global manufacturer of paints, coatings and specialty materials, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations.
increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.
our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. coatings raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide. these raw materials represent ppg's single largest production cost component.
while not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower.
most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations, and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations. our products use both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy.
an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner.
the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
during 2018, economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-use market. demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future. recently, global economic uncertainty has increased due to a number of factors, including slowing global growth, global stock and commodity market volatility, disruption in existing trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs, the united kingdom's exit from the european union, weaker demand in china and increasing interest rates in the united states. ppg provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. this broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities.
we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment.
environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. violations of these laws and regulations can also result
2018 ppg annual report and form 10-k 21
in fines and penalties. future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought.
ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment, securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including those described in note 14, "commitments and contingent liabilities" under item 8 of this form 10-k, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.
we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales, net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in u.s. dollars.
we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, which could increase our compliance costs and could adversely affect our results of operations.
we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs.
for example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains.
further, although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or businesses that we acquire. any non-compliance or such improper actions or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees.
our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results.
ppg has a significant investment in global operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our operations outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2018 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 62%.
22 2018 ppg annual report and 10-k changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate.
as a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes. our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. further, ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available. recent developments, including the european commission's investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic co-operation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. if our effective income tax rate was to increase, our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.
business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers.
integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations.
part of the company's strategy is growth through acquisitions. over the last decade, we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including:
•   difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business;
•   delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products;
•   diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns;
•   difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter;
•   unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability;
•   unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business;
•   difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and
•   difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses.
these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition.
our ability to understand our customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results.
our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.
we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years. vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings. in addition, through the introduction of new technologies, new business models or new methods of travel, such as ridesharing, the number of automotive oem new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings and related automotive parts.
2018 ppg annual report and form 10-k 23
our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive.
with each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations.
the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.
increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. this could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.
we have concluded that previously issued financial statements as detailed below should not be relied upon and have restated those previously issued financial statements, which has led to, among other things, shareholder litigation, investigations by the sec and the u.s. attorney's office and unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees, and may result in certain other risks.
as discussed in the explanatory note, note 2, "restatement of previously reported consolidated annual financial statements" and in note 19, "quarterly financial information (unaudited)" under item 8 of the 2017 form 10-k/a, we have concluded that our previously issued financial statements as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, and for each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2017, and the final quarterly and year-to-date period in 2016, should no longer be relied upon. the determination that the applicable financial statements should no longer be relied upon and that these financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of misstatements. although the company has restated these financial statements and the material weakness in the company's internal control over financial reporting has been remediated, as a result of these misstatements, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement, the outcome of our shareholder litigation and government investigations, potential loss of investor confidence, and a negative impact on our stock price. our shareholder litigation and the government investigations could result in substantial defense costs regardless of the outcome of the litigation or investigation. if we do not prevail in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs.
we are involved in investigations by the sec and the u.s. attorney's office which are costly to conduct and may result in substantial financial and other penalties, as well as adverse effects on our business and financial condition.
in connection with the audit committee's review of alleged violations of our accounting policies and procedures, we self-reported this matter to the sec. we are cooperating with the sec and the u.s. attorney's office in their investigations of this matter. these investigations are continuing, and we are currently unable to predict their duration, scope or results or whether the sec or u.s. attorney will commence any legal action. if we are found to have violated securities laws or other federal statutes, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil and criminal fines and penalties, modifications of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance. the imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, revenues, results of operations and financial condition.

u.s. and canada sales volumes declined slightly year-over-year, with mixed demand by business and end-use segment. sales volumes in architectural coatings u.s. company-owned stores grew by a mid-single-digit percentage, but were more than offset by sales volumes declines in the independent dealer networks and national retail (diy) customer accounts in aggregate. automotive oem coatings sales volumes declined year-over-year and lagged industry demand levels due to a customer-driven share shift away from ppg that was offset in other regions of the world. these decreases in sales volumes were partially offset by higher sales volumes in specialty coatings and materials, automotive refinish coatings, general industrial coatings, aerospace coatings and packaging coatings.
emea sales volumes increased a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. sales volumes in our automotive oem coatings and aerospace coatings businesses each grew by a mid-single-digit percentage. specialty coatings and materials sales volumes grew by a double-digit percentage, driven by strong silica demand. protective coatings volumes also grew year-over-year. these increases in sales volumes were partially offset by lower demand in architectural coatings.

2018 vs. 2017
performance coatings net sales increased (4%) due to the following:
● higher selling prices (+3%)
● favorable foreign currency translation (+1%)
higher selling prices across all businesses were achieved, reflecting the value of our products and services and which offset persistent raw material and logistics cost inflation.
architectural coatings - americas and asia-pacific sales volumes decreased by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. sales volumes were positive year-over-year in the u.s. and canada company-owned store network as well as in mexico, central america, australia and brazil. this growth was more than offset by lower diy and independent dealer network channel declines, including the unfavorable impact from a customer assortment change in the u.s. architectural diy channel. in february 2018, ppg announced that lowe's would discontinue the sale of olympic® brand paints and stains in its u.s. retail stores, effective mid-2018. during the second quarter 2018, the company launched its olympic® stain products at the home depot®'s u.s. retail stores, expanding an existing partnership arrangement. the net impact of these customer assortment changes resulted in net sales being lower by approximately $100 million in 2018.
architectural coatings - emea net sales grew by a mid-single digit percentage. higher selling prices and acquisition-related sales more than offset modestly lower sales volumes. sales volumes grew in countries in northern and eastern europe and were lower in southern europe.
automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew by a low-single-digit percentage year-over-year, despite lower demand in the u.s. due to customer inventory destocking and lower industry collision claim activity. organic sales increased in all other geographic regions as customers continued to adopt ppg's industry leading technologies.
aerospace coatings sales volumes grew by more than 10 percent versus the prior year, including above-market volume growth in the u.s. and asia. strong growth was supported by positive industry demand fundamentals and market outperformance in all major platforms stemming from technology advantaged products.
protective and marine coatings sales volumes increased by a high-single-digit percentage year-over-year. protective coatings sales volumes were up a mid-single-digit percentage, driven by growth in china. marine coatings sales volumes grew by more than 10 percent off a low sales base as ship building activity grew modestly in asia.
segment income decreased $13 million year-over-year primarily driven by increasing raw material and logistics costs. these cost increases were partially offset by higher selling prices and additional benefits from the company's restructuring programs. favorable foreign currency translation increased segment income by approximately $15 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the euro.
2017 vs. 2016
performance coatings net sales increased (2%) due to the following:
● higher selling prices (+1%)
● net sales from acquisitions (+1%)
● modest foreign currency translation partially offset by:
● slightly lower sales volumes selling prices increased year-over-year primarily due to selling price initiatives across all businesses to combat accelerating raw material cost inflation.
architectural coatings - americas and asia pacific sales volumes declined a low-single-digit-percentage versus the prior year. sales volumes increased by a mid-single-digit percentage in company-owned stores in the u.s. and canada, including
2018 ppg annual report and form 10-k 33
the unfavorable impact from natural disasters in the third quarter 2017. this increase was more than offset by sales volume declines in the u.s. and canada independent dealer networks and national retail (diy) customer accounts, as both distribution channels continued to experience soft demand. organic sales improved in both the latin america and asia pacific regions.
architectural coatings - emea net sales increased by a high-single-digit percentage year-over-year, primarily due to acquisition-related sales, principally deutek and univer, which contributed approximately $85 million to net sales. sales volumes were down year-over-year primarily driven by continued weak demand in france and eastern europe, as well as our turning away certain business due to low profitability or lack of customer acceptance of selling price increases. demand growth continued in northern europe, where we continued to outperform the market.
automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew by a low-single-digit percentage year-over-year, led by above-market performance in u.s. and canada as customers continued to adopt ppg's industry leading technologies. organic sales also increased in the latin american region versus the prior year, reflecting high end-use market demand. in asia pacific, net sales increased, largely due to the recent futian xinshi acquisition in china.
aerospace coatings sales volumes grew by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year, led by above market performance in europe and consistent with the overall industry demand.
protective and marine coatings sales volumes declined by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. protective coatings sales volumes expanded in most regions, led by europe, but were more than offset by significant weakness in new shipbuilding activity, primarily in the asia pacific region.
segment income decreased $9 million year-over-year primarily due increasing raw material costs, wage and other cost inflation, and lower sales volumes partially offset by selling price increases, lower overhead and manufacturing costs, including the initial benefits from business restructuring actions.
looking ahead looking ahead, year-over-year raw material cost inflation is expected in the first half of 2019, primarily due to carry-over inflation. acquisition related sales are forecast to add a low-single-digit percentage of sales growth primarily from the sem acquisition and based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation to have an unfavorable impact on segment sales of approximately $100 million in the first quarter.
additionally, further selling price increases are expected in 2019 as we continue to offset the cumulative impact of raw material inflation over the past nine quarters. net sales are expected to be lower in the first half compared to 2018 driven by lower u.s. diy sales of approximately $110 million due to the customer assortment changes that occurred in 2018. the impact will be larger than the impact realized in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the seasonality of the u.s. diy business.

2018 vs. 2017
industrial coatings segment net sales increased (5%) due to the following:
● acquisition-related sales (+1.5%)
● higher selling prices (+1.5%)
● higher sales volumes (+1%)
selling prices increased sequentially throughout the year and were up approximately 1.5 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the general industrial and packaging businesses.
industrial coatings sales volumes continued to grow led by strong outperformance in coil, heavy-duty equipment and electronics materials. from a geographic perspective, sales volume growth was led by emea and latin america. acquisition-related sales from the crown group added approximately $100 million in sales during the year.
packaging coatings sales volumes were up a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year driven by continued customer adoption of ppg's new can coating technologies. from a geographic perspective, sales volumes in the developed regions grew a high-single-digit percentage, offset by a low-single-digit percentage decrease in the asia pacific region.
ppg's automotive oem coatings sales volumes were slightly lower versus the prior year, consistent with the global automotive industry growth rate. in the second half of the year, automotive oem production fell sharply in china and new emission standards negatively impacted production in europe.
specialty coatings and materials net sales increased by a low-single-digit percentage due to higher selling prices and higher sales volumes in emea.
segment income decreased $161 million year-over-year primarily due to continuing, significant raw material and logistics cost inflation, partially offset by higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs, including benefits from business restructuring actions. favorable foreign currency translation added approximately $5 million to segment income.
2017 vs. 2016
industrial coatings segment net sales increased (6%) due to the following:
● higher sales volumes (+4%)
● acquisition-related sales (+3%)
partially offset by:
● lower selling prices (1%)
ppg's automotive oem coatings sales volumes increased by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year, consistent with the global automotive industry production growth rate, led by china, mexico, europe and brazil. sales volumes declined in the u.s. and canada, partially reflecting fewer automotive new builds.
general industrial coatings and specialty coatings and materials sales volumes, in aggregate, grew by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. sales volumes grew year-over-year in every major region with mixed demand by end-use and geography. this growth was led by asia pacific and the u.s., which outpaced regional industrial production demand growth. sales volumes grew across most segments, including year-over-year increases in electronics materials, heavy duty equipment and organic light emitting diode (oled) materials. acquisition-related sales, primarily metokote, added approximately $155 million.
packaging coatings sales volumes grew by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, primarily driven by ongoing industry conversions to ppg's new can coatings technologies, led by the u.s.
segment income decreased $81 million year-over-year primarily due to increasing raw material costs, lower selling prices and wage and other cost inflation. these cost increases were partially offset by income from higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing and overhead costs, including the initial benefits from business restructuring actions, and acquisition-related income.
2018 ppg annual report and form 10-k 35
looking ahead looking ahead, we expect that greater volatility in global industrial demand will continue through the first quarter of 2019 with inconsistencies by region. the carryover impact from 2018 cost inflation and significantly unfavorable foreign currency translation will impact first quarter earnings. the company will continue to prioritize implementing selling price increases and operating margin recovery.
global automotive oem industry demand is expected to remain soft in the first quarter for most major regions with greater volatility expected in china. we anticipate that aggregate global general industrial demand growth will continue, but at a more moderate rate than in the first quarter of 2019. in addition, we expect that the whitford acquisition will close during the latter portion of the first quarter, pending required regulatory approvals, and therefore will not provide meaningful sales or earnings benefit in the quarter. in addition, we expect packaging sales volumes to moderate as the pace of technology conversions slow in 2019.
review and outlook during 2018, economic conditions were generally positive in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-uses. ppg's aggregate organic sales grew approximately 3% versus the prior year. acquisition-related sales from two acquisitions completed in 2017 and the four completed in 2018 contributed approximately 1% to net sales growth year-over-year, net of dispositions. foreign currency translation was favorable for the first half of the year then turned unfavorable in the second half of the year. for the full year 2018, foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately 1%. raw material inflation was elevated throughout the year and overall rose a mid-single digit percentage driven by supply related factors, including government mandated production curtailments in china to help improve pollution and higher oil prices. in addition, logistics costs were significantly higher in 2018 driven by higher oil prices and shortages in the availability in transportation.
u.s. and canada during 2018, the pace of economic activity improved in the u.s. and canada region versus the prior year, led by stronger gdp growth in the u.s. despite flat automotive industry builds. demand in the residential and commercial construction markets was modestly higher in 2018 compared to 2017. new home starts advanced approximately 4% in 2018 versus approximately 3% in 2017. residential remodeling was flat in 2018 versus 2017, while commercial construction was flat compared to a 1% decline in 2017. market demand for architectural paint continued to shift more to the professional trade painters channel as the continued decline in u.s. unemployment resulted in consumers choosing professional painters rather than completing projects themselves. demand in u.s. do-it-yourself (diy) paint stores continued to remain soft throughout the year consistent with 2017. ppg's architectural coatings performance in the u.s. and canada was impacted by diy customer assortment changes that unfavorably impacted sales by approximately $100 million. the automotive refinish coatings business was impacted by lower collision rates and a higher number of automobiles in accidents being totaled rather than repainted offsetting modest growth in miles driven. ppg's packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry driven by continued strong sales growth momentum related to customer adoption of ppg's new interior can coatings technologies. ppg's automotive oem coatings business performance was slightly better than industry demand levels due to modest share gains. the u.s. and canada region remained ppg's largest, representing approximately 42% of 2018 sales, although a smaller percentage of total sales than in the prior year.
europe, middle east and africa european economic activity was mixed in 2018. industrial production was higher in the first half of the year and moderated as the year progressed. the region was impacted by continuing uncertainty over the united kingdom's exit from the european union. overall gdp and industrial production were similar to 2017 in the region. regional demand continued to be mixed by country and end-uses. demand for ppg's products in several end-uses drove the regional growth rate, including above market performance in general industrial coatings, packaging coatings and specialty coatings and materials. ppg's architectural coatings - emea business sales volumes decreased year-over-year, driven by soft demand in southern europe.
emea represented approximately 30% of ppg's 2018 sales, similar to prior year levels. regional coatings volumes remain approximately 15% below their pre-recession levels in 2008. the modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic growth in the region. ppg expects modest volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand. in the second half of the year, the euro and british pound both depreciated against the u.s. dollar.
asia pacific and latin america the emerging regions of asia pacific and latin america represented 28% of ppg's 2018 sales in aggregate, similar to the prior year.
36 2018 ppg annual report and 10-k asia remained the largest emerging region, with sales of approximately $2.5 billion, led by china, which continued as ppg's second largest country by revenue. the performance coatings segment led sales volume growth in asia, in part due to strong sales volume growth in protective and marine coatings, aerospace coatings, and automotive refinish coatings. these increases were partially offset by a decline in automotive oem coatings, particularly in china where industry retail automobile sales fell for the first time in over 25 years.
overall, demand in latin america improved year-over-year for the second consecutive year, with continued above market growth in mexico and central america. economic conditions were mixed in south america, and there was heightened currency volatility throughout the entire region. in mexico, the ppg-comex business added over 200 new concessionaire locations. the overall region's performance was supported by strong growth in the general industrial and packaging coatings businesses. foreign currency translation was volatile and finished 4 percent unfavorable compared to 2017, principally the mexican peso and brazilian real.
outlook looking ahead to 2019, we expect global market growth to continue, but we expect a downshift in the pace of growth, and it will likely be uneven by region and end-use. we expect most regional growth rates to be modestly lower than 2018, but the latin america region growth rate to be slightly higher.
we anticipate ppg's u.s. and canada regional growth will be led by general industrial coatings and aerospace coatings, with flat automotive industry builds. we expect growth in housing and commercial construction to be comparable to 2018.
we expect demand in europe to grow but at lower levels than 2018. regional growth is expected to remain mixed by sub-region and country. favorable end-use trends are expected to continue in general industrial and packaging with flattening demand in automotive oem coatings as industry growth rates are anticipated to be flat. demand is expected to stay subdued in the architectural coatings business. we continue to monitor the economic environment in the u.k. as their exit from the european union progresses and impacts consumer sentiment and coatings demand.
in asia pacific, we expect continued industrial production growth in china, southeast asia and india. in china, we foresee continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption. the sharp decline in automotive oem activity seen in the second half of 2018 is expected to continue in the beginning of 2019. we expect year-over-year demand patterns to become more favorable in the second half of 2019. the recovery in marine coatings demand is expected to continue, albeit off a low base.
in latin america, we anticipate economic expansion will continue in mexico, most of central america and south america.
significant other factors in may 2018, ppg initiated an $83 million global restructuring program. the program is largely centered around the change in customer assortment related to the u.s. architectural coatings diy business. ppg recognized $18 million of savings from this program in 2018.
significant progress was made on the global restructuring program that was announced in december 2016. this program targeted annual savings of approximately $125 million once fully implemented. the company achieved approximately $60 million of savings in 2018 bringing the total savings to approximately $110 million to date.
we expect to achieve the full-annualized target of $125 million in 2019. we will continue to aggressively manage the company's cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment, and we will make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace. restructuring savings from the 2018 and 2016 programs are expected to be between $60 million and $70 million in 2019.
raw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings. ppg experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors. in aggregate, average raw material costs were higher by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2018 versus 2017 due to variety of reasons, including supplier force majeure, environmental regulation enforcement, and higher crude oil prices. ppg currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase a low-single-digit percentage in the first half of 2019, with impacts varied by region and commodity, marking the tenth and eleventh consecutive quarters of inflation. in addition, logistics costs were inflated throughout the year driven by higher crude oil prices and availability of transportation. logistics costs are expected to further increase in 2019.
in 2018, we achieved broad selling price improvement, reflecting the company's efforts to offset higher raw material costs. further benefits from selling price actions are necessary in 2019 to recover profit contribution margins. the company will carefully monitor raw material costs during 2019 and assess the need for additional increases to selling prices for increases in these costs.
2018 ppg annual report and form 10-k 37
pension and postretirement benefit costs, excluding settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits, totaled approximately $30 million in 2018, down approximately $20 million from 2017. in 2019, we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs will be approximately $30 million, similar to 2018.
ppg contributed $75 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and $54 million in 2017. in 2018, the company made contributions aggregating $24 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. in 2019, mandatory contributions to ppg's non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million.
in 2018, favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half of the year was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of the year. based on mid-january 2019 exchange rates, the company expects year-over-year unfavorable foreign currency translation to decrease 2019 sales by $400 million to $500 million and 2019 income before income taxes by $50 million to $70 million. we expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more prevalent during the first half of 2019 due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends. the foreign currency environment continues to be volatile, and the impact on 2019 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from this estimate. the company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction related impacts.
the 2019 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%. this range represents the company's best estimate, including updated guidance for the 2017 the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act.
over the past five years, the company used over $5 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 50 million shares of ppg stock, including approximately $1.7 billion in 2018. the company ended the year with approximately $1.8 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. during 2018, the company deployed approximately $380 million for acquisitions and $450 million for dividends. ppg increased its per-share dividend in october 2018, marking the 47th annual per share dividend increase and the 119th consecutive year of annual dividend payments.
ppg ended 2018 with approximately $1 billion in cash and short-term investments. the company expects continued strong cash generation in 2019.

commitments and contingent liabilities, including environmental matters ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. see item 3. "legal proceedings" and note 14, "commitments and contingent liabilities" under item 8 of this form 10-k for a description of certain of these lawsuits.
as discussed in item 3 and note 14, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.
it is ppg's policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. in management's opinion, the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company's environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg's financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. management anticipates that the resolution of the company's environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.
the company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with ppg's former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city, n.j. and associated sites ("new jersey chrome"). information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the new jersey department of environmental protection in 2021.
there are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals. considerable uncertainty exists
38 2018 ppg annual report and 10-k regarding the timing of these future events for the new jersey chrome sites. final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years. as these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.
liquidity and capital resources during the past three years, ppg has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.

2018 vs. 2017
the $64 million decrease in cash from operating activities - continuing operations was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and lower income in 2018 partially offset by lower cash taxes.
2017 vs. 2016
the $333 million increase in cash from operating activities - continuing operations was primarily due to the absence of the prior year funding of the pittsburgh corning asbestos trust (the "trust"), lower defined benefit pension contributions, lower restructuring payments and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2017 and higher working capital.
operating working capital operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. see note 4, "working capital detail" under item 8 of this form 10-k for further information related to the components of the company's operating working capital. we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.

(3)   the unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice.
other liquidity matters at december 31, 2018, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was $182 million. the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company's off-balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the "liquidity and capital resources" section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 9, "borrowings and lines of credit" under item 8 of this form 10-k.
critical accounting estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10-k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.
contingencies contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. for more information on these matters, see note 14, "commitments and contingent liabilities" and note 12, "income taxes" under item 8 of this form 10-k.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. to accomplish this, we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. the company has
42 2018 ppg annual report and 10-k established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. see note 13, "employee benefit plans" under item 8 of this form 10-k for information on these plans and the assumptions used.
business combinations in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities.
the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining which intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.
goodwill and intangible assets the company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount. fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. for more information on these matters, see note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies" under item 8 of this form 10-k.
we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10-k related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.
currency comparing exchange rates from december 31, 2017 to december 31, 2018, the u.s. dollar strengthened against all other major currencies associated with countries in which ppg operates, most notably the australian dollar, british pound, chinese yuan, euro and south korean won. as a result, consolidated net assets at december 31, 2018 decreased by approximately $167 million from december 31, 2017. comparing exchange rates from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017, the u.s. dollar was weaker against the currencies in most countries in which ppg operates, most notably the mexican peso, british pound, chinese yuan and euro. as a result, consolidated net assets at december 31, 2017 increased by approximately $231 million from december 31, 2016.
comparing exchange rates during 2018 to those of 2017, in the countries in which ppg operates, there was a favorable impact of approximately $21 million on full year 2018 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into u.s. dollars. comparing exchange rates during 2017 to those of 2016, in the countries in which ppg operates, there was an unfavorable impact of approximately $7 million on full year 2017 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into u.s. dollars.
forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. management's discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
you can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words "aim," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "project," "outlook," "forecast" and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission. also, note the following cautionary statements.
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. such factors include global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations
2018 ppg annual report and form 10-k 43
in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in the markets we serve, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including the identification of additional control deficiencies, further expenditures related to our restatement, the results of governmental actions relating to pending investigations, the results of shareholder actions relating to the restatement of our financial statements and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation. however, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.
consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or income, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10-k and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

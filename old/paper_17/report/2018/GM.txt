item 1a. risk factors we have listed below the most significant risk factors applicable to us. these risk factors are not necessarily in the order of importance or probability of occurrence:
if we do not deliver new products, services and customer experiences in response to increased competition in the automotive industry, our business could suffer.  we believe that the automotive industry will continue to experience significant change in the coming years. in addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the entrance of non-traditional participants in the automotive industry. industry participants are disrupting the historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new technologies, products, services, and methods of travel and vehicle ownership. it is strategically significant that we lead the technological disruption occurring in our industry, including consumer adoption of electric vehicles and commercialization of autonomous vehicles in a rideshare environment. to successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that are outside of our historically core business, such as autonomous and electric vehicles, digital services and transportation as a service. the process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is complex, costly, and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent. there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, or that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.
our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. we operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. producing new and improved vehicle models preserving our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars and trucks is critical to our long-term profitability. successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. it generally takes two years or more to design and develop a new vehicle, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products, may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.
our profitability is dependent upon the success of suvs and full-size pick-up trucks. while we offer a balanced portfolio of cars, crossovers, suvs and trucks, we generally recognize higher profit margins on our suvs and trucks. our success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. any shift in consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel- efficient vehicles, whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of global political instability or other reasons, could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles.
we may continue to restructure our operations in the u.s. and various other countries and initiate additional cost reduction actions, but we may not succeed in doing so.  since 2017, we have undertaken restructuring actions to lower our operating costs in response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world, including the u.s., korea and europe. as we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in asset write-downs or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. in addition, we are continuing to implement a number of operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs. for example, in late 2018, we announced certain transformation actions to drive significant cost efficiencies and realign our current
10
general motors company and subsidiaries manufacturing capacity and utilization in response to market-related volume declines in passenger cars. there is no guarantee that we will realize the anticipated savings or benefits from past or future restructuring and/or cost reduction actions in full or within the time periods we expect. in addition, these actions also subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes, litigation, negative publicity and business disruption. failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring and/or cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.
our electric vehicle strategy is dependent upon our ability to reduce the cost of manufacturing electric vehicles, as well as increased consumer adoption. we anticipate that the production and profitable sale of electric vehicles will become increasingly important to our business. our inability to reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of battery-electric vehicles may negatively impact our earnings and financial condition. we currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development of electric vehicles. the benefits from these incentives could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted, which may negatively affect our ability to sell electric vehicles at high enough prices to be profitable. in addition, our sale of electric vehicles is dependent upon consumer adoption, which could be impacted by numerous factors, including perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost; perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge; high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles; volatility in the cost of fuel; government regulations and economic incentives; and access to charging facilities.
our autonomous vehicle strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational, and regulatory risks. in recent years, we announced significant investments in autonomous vehicle technologies, including in gm cruise holdings llc (gm cruise holdings), our subsidiary that is responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. our autonomous vehicle operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies, including: our ability to continue to develop self-driving software and hardware, such as lidar sensors and other components; access to sufficient capital, including with respect to additional softbank funding that is subject to regulatory approval; risks related to the manufacture of purpose-built autonomous vehicles; and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies, some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to autonomous vehicle technologies than we do. in addition, we face risks related to the commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles on our targeted timeline or at all, including consumer acceptance, achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain, evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state regulations. to the extent accidents, cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving systems occur, we could be subject to liability, government scrutiny and further regulation. any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.
our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales, including real estate values, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment, availability of affordable financing, fluctuations in the cost of fuel, consumer confidence, political unrest and global economic conditions. for a discussion of economic and market trends, see the overview section of the md&a. we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty.
11
general motors company and subsidiaries our significant business in china subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. our business in china is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as non-traditional market participants, such as domestic technology companies. in addition, our success in china depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to infotainment and other new technologies. increased competition, increased u.s.-china trade restrictions and weakening economic conditions in china, among other things, may result in price reductions, reduced sales, profitability, and margins, and challenges to gain or hold market share. in addition to increased competition, chinese regulators have announced aggressive "green" policy initiatives and quotas for the sale of electric vehicles, which have challenging lead times.
certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government, and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china. in order to maintain access to the chinese market, we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the chinese market, at times with challenging lead times to implement such requirements. these actions may increase the cost of doing business in china and reduce our profitability. in particular, the announced intention of several chinese cities to implement new china 6 emissions regulations in july 2019 represents a risk for the sales of our chinese joint ventures.
a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit. many of our operations, primarily in china and korea, are carried out by joint ventures. in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners' interests. in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures. in addition, because we share ownership and management with one or more parties, we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture, particularly when we own a minority interest. as a result, we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by a joint venture. moreover, a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance, internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive or other actions or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other related actions for these activities.
the international scale and footprint of our operations exposes us to additional risks. we manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products. our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, and a variety of other political, economic and regulatory risks including: (1) changes in government leadership; (2) changes in labor, tax and other laws, regulations or government policies impacting our overall business model or practices or restricting our ability to manufacture, purchase or sell products consistent with market demand and our business objectives; (3) political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair our ability to source raw materials, services, components, systems and parts, or manufacture products on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our business objectives; (4) political instability or government controls over certain sectors; (5) political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies, including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, especially between china and the u.s.; (6) more detailed inspections, new or higher tariffs, for example, on products imported into or exported from the u.s.; (7) new barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements, including changes to, withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements (for example, the north american free trade agreement or its successor), or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured products; (8) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in brazil and argentina, and interest rates; (9) economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, or significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate; (10) differing local product preferences and product requirements, including government certification requirements related to, among other things, fuel economy, vehicle emissions and safety; (11) impact of compliance with u.s. and other foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions; (12) liabilities resulting from u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anti-corruption laws; (13) differing labor regulations, requirements and union relationships; (14) differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships; and (15) difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations.
12
general motors company and subsidiaries any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule. we assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world. our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets. no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. in some cases, certain facilities produce products, systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others. should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions or catastrophic weather events, the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. we may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production. any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment.
in 2019, our collective bargaining agreement with the united automobile workers will expire, and we will negotiate a new agreement. in addition, in late 2018 we announced certain restructuring actions, which included among other things, a reduction in our workforce and the unallocation of products to certain manufacturing facilities in north america. as a result, we may be subject to an increased risk of strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions and employees.
any disruption in our suppliers' operations could disrupt our production schedule. our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. our use of "just-in-time" manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory. as a result, our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules. in some instances, we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. any number of factors, including labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, contractual or other disputes with suppliers, and supplier financial difficulties or solvency problems could disrupt our suppliers' operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including the production of certain of our higher margin vehicles. if we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely.
high prices of raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers could negatively impact our profitability. increases in prices for raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, or non-ferrous metals, including aluminum, copper and plastic, may lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. changes in trade policies and tariffs, fluctuations in supply and demand, and other economic and political factors may continue to create pricing pressure for raw materials and other inputs. this could, in turn, negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.
we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results. the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry far exceeds demand. many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs. many of our competitors have responded to these relatively high fixed costs by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. as a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher costs of marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations. our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances intended to enhance their competitiveness.
domestic manufacturers in lower cost countries, such as china and india, have become competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a low-cost alternative to established entry-level automobiles. in addition, foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers, including gm and its joint venture partners. these actions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results.
competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, and there are no guarantees that gm's intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services. there may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the value of our brands and other intangible assets, and our business may be adversely affected. moreover, although gm takes reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of gm proprietary information, there can be no assurance that such efforts will
13
general motors company and subsidiaries completely deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology. we sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, we may be the target of enforcement of patents by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to infringe any third-party rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services.
security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles, owned or maintained by us, gm financial, or third-party vendors or suppliers on our behalf, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information.  we rely upon information technology systems and manufacture networked products, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and products. additionally, we and gm financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, proprietary business information of our dealers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. the secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. despite security measures and business continuity plans, these systems and products may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers, computer viruses, or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and products. the occurrence of any of these events could compromise the operational integrity of these systems and products. similarly, such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products. such events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. in addition, such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. we have experienced such events in the past and, although past events were immaterial, future events may occur and may be material.
portions of our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors due to regular maintenance efforts, such as systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to design, manufacture and sell products and services, and interrupt other business processes.
security breaches and other disruptions of our in-vehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in gm and our products. our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. these systems control various vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window and door lock functions. we have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems. however, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. in addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles, their systems or data could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing, and security of the personal identifiable information of our customers, employees, or suppliers are subject to increasingly complex, restrictive, and punitive regulations in all key market regions. under these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry, resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as brand impact or other harm to our business. in addition, increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. because many of these laws are new, there is little clarity as to their interpretation, as well as a lack of precedent for the scope of enforcement. the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. for example, in europe, the general data protection regulation came into effect on may 25, 2018, and applies to all our ongoing operations in the eu. this regulation significantly increases the potential financial penalties for noncompliance, including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover. similar regulations are coming into effect in brazil, china, and california.
14
general motors company and subsidiaries our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations and policies that can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business. we are significantly affected by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio, particularly regulations relating to emissions and fuel economy standards. meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging, especially when standards may not be harmonized across jurisdictions. we anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact). these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions and interpretations, may result in substantial costs, including civil or criminal penalties. in addition, an evolving but un-harmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect revenue. refer to the "environmental and regulatory matters" section of item 1. business for further information on these requirements. we also expect that manufacturers will continue to be subject to increased scrutiny from regulators globally.
we expect that to comply with current or even revised fuel economy and emission control requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of electric vehicles, as well as develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all at increased cost levels. there are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, however. there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs.
in the current uncertain regulatory framework, environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial. alleged violations of safety, fuel economy or emissions standards could result in legal proceedings, the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, fines, restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items. any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.
many of our advanced technologies, including autonomous vehicles, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. any current or future regulations in these areas could impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.
we could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings.  we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation (both in the u.s. and elsewhere), stockholder litigation, labor litigation in various countries (including korea and brazil) and proceedings related to the ignition switch recall. in addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. a negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result in the imposition of damages, including punitive damages, substantial fines, significant reputational harm, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs. in addition, we may become obligated to issue additional shares (adjustment shares) of up to 30 million shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment to take into account stock dividends, stock splits and other transactions) to the motors liquidation company (mlc) guc trust (guc trust) under a provision of the amended and restated master sale and purchase agreement between us and general motors corporation and certain of its subsidiaries in the event that allowed general unsecured claims against the guc trust, as estimated by the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york (bankruptcy court), exceed $35.0 billion. the guc trust stated in public filings that allowed general unsecured claims were approximately $31.9 billion as of december 31, 2018. for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business.  government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns. under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for free repairs. at present, the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. the costs to complete a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform. concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like autonomous, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements, and reputational damage. these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the company's products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.
15
general motors company and subsidiaries we currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. from time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs.
we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the u.s. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the u.s. internal revenue service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. in addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks and uncertainties, including those arising from potential changes in laws and/or regulations in the countries in which we do business, the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws, and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate. for example, the impact of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the tax act), which was enacted on december 22, 2017, may differ from the company's previously recorded amounts, possibly materially, due to potential changes in the tax act (including with respect to the regulations promulgated thereunder) or changes to its interpretation. if our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.
we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers in north america, south america and asia/pacific. gm financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. any reduction in gm financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.
the primary factors that could adversely affect gm financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the sufficiency, availability and cost of sources of financing, including credit facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; higher than expected vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles gm financial leases to customers; fluctuations in interest rates and currencies; and changes to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.
further, as an entity operating in the financial services sector, gm financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results. compliance with these laws and regulations requires that gm financial maintain forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on gm financial's ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing. laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. the failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.
our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates, changes in laws or regulations, changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns. our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.
our future funding requirements for our u.s. defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in laws and regulations. future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. we estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions.
there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.
16
general motors company and subsidiaries factors which affect future funding requirements for our u.s. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-u.s. plans. certain plans outside the u.s. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our non-u.s. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. forward-looking statements in this md&a are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. refer to the "forward-looking statements" section of this md&a and item 1a. risk factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
non-gaap measures unless otherwise indicated, our non-gaap measures discussed in this md&a are related to our continuing operations and not our discontinued operations. our non-gaap measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (ebit)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; core ebit-adjusted; earnings per share (eps)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (etr-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (roic-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. our calculation of these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. as a result, the use of these non-gaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related u.s. gaap measures.
these non-gaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. furthermore, these non-gaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve roic-adjusted. management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. further, our board of directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. for these reasons we believe these non-gaap measures are useful for our investors.
ebit-adjusted ebit-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. examples of adjustments to ebit include but are not limited to impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. for ebit-adjusted and our other non-gaap measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-gaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item.
core ebit-adjusted  core ebit-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our core consolidated operating results. core ebit-adjusted begins with ebit-adjusted and excludes the ebit-adjusted results of gm cruise. prior to the three months ended june 30, 2018 core ebit-adjusted excluded the ebit-adjusted results of autonomous vehicle operations, including gm cruise, maven and our investment in lyft, inc. (lyft). the measure was changed to align with segment reporting. all periods presented have been recast to reflect the changes.
eps-diluted-adjusted eps-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted eps results on a consistent basis. eps-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less income (loss) from discontinued operations on an after-tax basis, adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
etr-adjusted etr-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. etr-adjusted is calculated as income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for eps-diluted-adjusted divided by income before income taxes less adjustments.
roic-adjusted roic-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. we define roic-adjusted as ebit-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by roic-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of capital leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (opeb) liabilities; and average
19
general motors company and subsidiaries automotive net income tax assets during the same period. adjustments to the average equity balances exclude assets and liabilities classified as either assets held for sale or liabilities held for sale.
adjusted automotive free cash flow adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for ebit-adjusted purposes. refer to the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a for additional information.

overview our management team has adopted a strategic plan to transform gm into the world's most valued automotive company. our plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will redefine the future of personal mobility through our zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion vision while also strengthening the core of our business: earning customers for life by delivering winning vehicles, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; leading in technology and innovation, including electrification, autonomous, data connectivity; growing our brands; making tough, strategic decisions about which markets and products in which we will invest and compete; building profitable adjacent businesses and targeting 10% core margins on an ebit-adjusted basis.
in addition to our ebit-adjusted margin improvement goal, through 2018 we fully realized our financial targets of $6.5 billion in total annual operational and functional cost savings compared to 2014 costs.
for the year ending december 31, 2019 we expect eps-diluted of between $5.17 and $6.00 and eps-diluted-adjusted of between $6.50 and $7.00. the following table reconciles expected eps-diluted under u.s. gaap to expected eps-diluted-adjusted and includes the future impact of the expected adjustment related to transformation activities:

we face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in a number of countries across the globe due to, among other factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emissions standards, foreign exchange volatility, rising materials prices, trade policy and political uncertainty. as a result of these conditions, we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital, as well as our cost structure in order to maintain a low breakeven point. refer to item 1a. risk factors for a discussion of these challenges. we expect transformation activities to drive approximately $6.0 billion of annual cash savings by the end of 2020, resulting from reductions in automotive and other cost of sales in our consolidated financial statements, as well as reduced capital expenditures. this target includes approximately $4.5 billion of cost savings, to be achieved through staffing, manufacturing and product initiatives. as we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. these additional actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges which may have a material impact on our results of operations.

general motors company and subsidiaries gmna industry sales in north america were 21.5 million units in the year ended december 31, 2018 representing a decrease of 0.1% compared to the corresponding period in 2017. u.s. industry sales were 17.7 million units in the year ended december 31, 2018.
our total vehicle sales in the u.s., our largest market in north america, totaled 3.0 million units for market share of 16.7% in the year ended december 31, 2018 representing a decrease of 0.4 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2017. we continue to lead the u.s. industry in market share.
in november 2018 we announced plans to accelerate steps to improve our overall business performance including the reorganization of global product development staffs, the realignment of manufacturing capacity in response to market-related volume declines in passenger cars and a reduction of our salaried workforce. we recorded charges of $1.2 billion in the year ended december 31, 2018 and expect to record additional charges of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in 2019. these charges are primarily considered special for ebit-adjusted, eps diluted-adjusted, and adjusted automotive free cash flow purposes.
we estimate gmna's breakeven point at the u.s. industry level to be in the range of 10.0 to 11.0 million units. we expect to sustain a strong ebit-adjusted margin in 2019 on continued strength of the u.s. industry light vehicle sales, favorable vehicle mix and continued focus on overall cost savings partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities and tariffs, as well as pricing pressures.
the uaw contract ratified in november 2015 expires in september 2019. for discussion of the risks related to a significant labor disruption at one of our facilities, refer to item 1a. risk factors.
gmi industry sales in china were 26.5 million units in the year ended december 31, 2018 representing a decrease of 6.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2017. our total vehicle sales in china were 3.6 million units for a market share of 13.8% in the year ended december 31, 2018, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2017. we continue to see strength in sales of our cadillac vehicles, and chevrolet outperformed the passenger vehicle industry. baojun and wuling sales were impacted by the market slowdown in less developed cities and market shift away from mini commercial vehicles. our automotive china jvs generated equity income of $2.0 billion in the year ended december 31, 2018. in 2019 we expect industry sales to remain relatively flat with a continuation of pricing pressures, a more challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and new energy vehicles as well as a weaker chinese yuan against the u.s. dollar, which will continue to put pressure on our operations in china. while we expect china equity income to be moderately down, we expect to sustain strong china equity income by focusing on improvements in vehicle mix, cost efficiencies, and downstream performance optimization.
outside of china, many markets across the segment continue to improve, resulting in industry sales of 26.7 million units, representing an increase of 5.0% in the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017. this increase was due primarily to increases in india and brazil. our total vehicle sales were 1.2 million units for a market share of 4.7% in the year ended december 31, 2018, representing a decrease of 0.4 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2017.
in february 2018 we announced the closure of a facility and other restructuring actions in korea. we recorded charges of $1.1 billion consisting of $0.6 billion in non-cash asset impairments and other charges and $0.5 billion in employee separation charges in the year ended december 31, 2018. we incurred $0.8 billion in cash outflows resulting from these korea restructuring actions for employee separations and statutory pension payments in the year ended december 31, 2018. the charges are considered special for ebit-adjusted, eps-diluted-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow reporting purposes. refer to note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for information related to these restructuring actions.
in connection with these restructuring actions, the korea development bank (kdb) purchased approximately $0.7 billion of gm korea company's (gm korea) class b preferred shares from gm korea (gm korea preferred shares) in 2018. in conjunction with the gm korea preferred share issuance we agreed to provide gm korea future funding, if needed, not to exceed $2.8 billion through december 31, 2027, inclusive of $2.0 billion of planned capital expenditures through 2027. the actions being taken to address gm korea's financial and operational performance have and may continue to result in litigation, negative publicity, business disruption, and labor unrest. refer to note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

the ignition switch recall has led to various inquiries, investigations, subpoenas, requests for information and complaints from agencies or other representatives of u.s., federal, state and canadian governments. in addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits. such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of material damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies. refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
takata matters in may 2016 nhtsa issued an amended consent order requiring takata to file defect information reports (dirs) for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain phased-stabilized ammonium nitrate-based propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multi-year, risk-based schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers. nhtsa concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of time, temperature cycling and environmental moisture.
although we do not believe there is a safety defect at this time in any unrecalled gm vehicles within scope of the takata dirs, in cooperation with nhtsa we have filed preliminary dirs covering certain of our gmt900 vehicles, which are full-size pickup trucks and suvs. we have also filed petitions for inconsequentiality with respect to the vehicles subject to those preliminary dirs. nhtsa has consolidated our petitions and will rule on them at the same time.
while these petitions have been pending, we have provided nhtsa with the results of our long-term studies and the studies performed by third-party experts, all of which form the basis for our determination that the inflators in these vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair should ultimately be required.
we believe these vehicles are currently performing as designed and our inflator aging studies and field data support the belief that the vehicles' unique design and integration mitigates against inflator propellant degradation and rupture risk. for example, the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles, and include features such as greater venting, unique propellant wafer configurations, and machined steel end caps. the inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system. also, these vehicles have features that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed, such as larger interior volumes and standard solar absorbing windshields and side glass.
accordingly, no warranty provision has been made for any repair associated with our vehicles subject to the preliminary dirs and amended consent order. however, in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the vehicles subject to current or future takata dirs under the amended consent order in the u.s., we estimate a reasonably possible impact to gm of approximately $1.2 billion.
gm has recalled certain vehicles sold outside of the u.s. to replace takata inflators in those vehicles. there are significant differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the u.s. we continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators. additional recalls, if any, could be material to our results of operations and cash flows. we continue to monitor the international situation.

automotive financing - gm financial summary and outlook we believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental gm financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. the expansion of gm financial's leasing program results in increased exposure to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. used vehicle prices in 2018 held at similar levels as compared to 2017. we expect a decrease of 4% to 5% in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to continued increases in the industry supply of used vehicles. the following table summarizes the residual value as well as the number of units included in gm financial equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):

gmi total net sales and revenue in the year ended december 31, 2018 total net sales and revenue decreased due primarily to: (1) decreased wholesale volumes in korea due to the closure of a facility, in argentina primarily driven by lower industry volumes, and in asia/pacific due to the withdrawal from the indian and south african markets in 2017, partially offset by an increase in brazil primarily due to an increase in sales of the chevrolet onix, tracker and equinox; (2) unfavorable other due primarily to the foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the brazilian real and argentine peso against the u.s. dollar; partially offset by (3) favorable pricing related to carryover vehicles in argentina and brazil.
in the year ended december 31, 2017 total net sales and revenue increased due primarily to: (1) favorable pricing related to carryover vehicles in argentina and brazil and in egypt to mitigate the impact of the weakening egyptian pound against the u.s. dollar; (2) favorable mix driven by the increased sales of chevrolet cruze in brazil and argentina; and (3) increased wholesale volumes associated with the chevrolet onix in brazil and argentina, partially offset by decreased wholesale volumes across multiple product lines in asia/pacific, the middle east and africa; (4) flat other due primarily to the foreign currency effect resulting from the strengthening of the brazilian real and korean won against the u.s. dollar, offset by the depreciation of the argentine peso and egyptian pound against the u.s. dollar and decreased parts and accessories sales in the middle east.

liquidity and capital resources we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. we expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations and future debt issuances. we also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. our future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on three objectives: (1) reinvest in our business; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet; and (3) return available cash to shareholders. our known future material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of $8.0 billion to $9.0 billion in 2019 as well as payments for engineering and product development activities; (2) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls, the settlements of the multi-district litigation and any other recall-related contingencies; (3) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (4) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our board of directors; and (5) payments to purchase shares of our common stock authorized by our board of directors.
our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "forward-looking statements" section of this md&a and item 1a. risk factors, some of which are outside of our control.
we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long-term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. these actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations such as our pension plans, as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions, investments with joint venture partners and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. in september 2018, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes to pre-fund $0.6 billion in certain mandatory contributions to our u.k. and canada pension plans due in 2019 through 2021.
our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our board of directors, not less than once annually. management reaffirmed and our board of directors approved the capital allocation program, which includes reinvesting in our business at an average target roic-adjusted rate of 20% or greater, maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including an average automotive target cash balance of $18 billion, and returning available cash to shareholders.
as part of our capital allocation program, our board of directors authorized programs to purchase $9.0 billion in aggregate of our common stock which were completed in the three months ended september 30, 2016 and 2017. we announced in january 2017 that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional $5.0 billion of our common stock with no expiration date, subsequent to completing the remaining portion of the previously announced programs. we completed $1.6 billion of the $5.0 billion program through december 31, 2018, which included $0.1 billion purchased in the three months ended march 31, 2018 in conjunction with the sale of gm common stock by the uaw retiree medical benefits trust (new veba). from inception of the program in 2015 through january 25, 2019 we had purchased an aggregate of 302 million shares of our outstanding common stock under our common stock repurchase program for $10.6 billion.
automotive liquidity total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and funds available under credit facilities. the amount of available liquidity is subject to intra-month and seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.

general motors company and subsidiaries we manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. approximately 90% of our cash and marketable securities were managed within north america and at our regional treasury centers at december 31, 2018. we have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.
our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars and include investments in u.s. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities. our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. the majority of our current investments in debt securities are with a/a2 or better rated issuers.
we use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. at december 31, 2017 the total size of our credit facilities was $14.5 billion, which consisted principally of our two primary revolving credit facilities. in april 2018 we amended and restated our two existing revolving credit facilities and entered into a third facility, increasing our aggregate borrowing capacity from $14.5 billion to $16.5 billion. these facilities consist of a 364-day, $2.0 billion facility, a three-year, $4.0 billion facility and a five-year, $10.5 billion facility. the facilities are available to us as well as certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, including gm financial. the three-year, $4.0 billion facility allows for borrowings in u.s. dollars and other currencies and includes a letter of credit sub-facility of $1.1 billion. the five-year, $10.5 billion facility allows for borrowings in u.s. dollars and other currencies. the 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allows for borrowing in u.s. dollars only. we have allocated the 364-day, $2.0 billion facility for exclusive use by gm financial. total automotive available credit under the facility remained unchanged at $14.5 billion at december 31, 2018. in january 2019 we entered into a new three-year unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing capacity of $3.0 billion, reducing to $2.0 billion in july 2020. the facility will be used to fund costs related to the transformation activities announced in november 2018 and to provide additional financial flexibility.
we did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017. gm financial did not have any borrowings against our credit facility designated for their exclusive use at december 31, 2018 or the remainder of our revolving credit facilities at december 31, 2018 and 2017. refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. we had intercompany loans from gm financial of $0.6 billion and $0.4 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, which consisted primarily of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to gm financial. refer to note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in may 2018 we entered into an agreement with kdb to fund capital expenditure requirements of gm korea. in the year ended december 31, 2018 kdb purchased $0.7 billion of gm korea preferred shares. additionally we agreed to provide future funding to gm korea if needed, not to exceed $2.8 billion through december 31, 2027, inclusive of $2.0 billion of planned capital expenditures through 2027. refer to note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.
in september 2018 we issued $2.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with an initial weighted average interest rate of 5.03% and maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2049. the notes are governed by the same indenture that was used in past issuances, which contains terms and covenants customary of these types of securities including limitations on the amount of certain secured debt we may incur. the net proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes were used to repay $1.5 billion of debt in october 2018 upon maturity, pre-fund $0.6 billion in certain mandatory contributions for our u.k. and canada pension plans due in 2019 through 2021, and for other general corporate purposes.
gm financial's board of directors declared and paid a dividend of $0.4 billion on its common stock in october 2018. future dividends from gm financial will depend on a number of factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.

critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
product warranty and recall campaigns the estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.
we accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable, which is generally at the time of sale.
the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall campaigns, the number of vehicles per recall campaign, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall campaign. these estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns. costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. these estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.
the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the take rate, and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. a 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.2 billion.
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.
sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. a change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in automotive net sales and revenue.
valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases, which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms which typically range from two to five years. at the beginning of the lease an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. the expected residual value is based on third-party data which considers inputs including recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. realization of the
38
general motors company and subsidiaries residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions. the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle prior to or at the end of the contract, we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is below the expected residual value estimated at the inception of the lease.
the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases, net (vehicles in thousands):
december 31, 2018         december 31, 2017
cars              379                       450
trucks            296                       285
crossovers        917                       818
suvs              111                        99
total           1,703                     1,652
at december 31, 2018 the estimated residual value of our leased assets at the end of the lease term was $31.4 billion. we periodically review the adequacy of the depreciation rates. if we believe that the expected residual values of the leased assets have changed, we revise the depreciation rate to ensure the net investment in the operating leases reflects the revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term. such adjustments to the depreciation rate would result in a change in depreciation expense on leased assets which is recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. the following table illustrates the effect of a 1% change in the estimated residual values at december 31, 2018, which would increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of our operating lease portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant:
impact to depreciation expense cars                             $49
trucks                            73
crossovers                       150
suvs                              42
total                           $314
we also evaluate the carrying value of the operating leases aggregated by vehicle make, year and model into leased asset groups, check for indicators of impairment and test for impairment to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable accounting standards. a leased asset group is considered impaired if impairment indicators exist and the undiscounted expected future cash flows (including the expected residual value) are lower than the carrying value of the asset group. we believe no impairment indicators existed during 2018, 2017 or 2016.
pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. our pension obligations include korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.
in december 2018 an investment policy study was completed for the u.s. pension plans. as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 6.6% at december 31, 2017 to 6.4% at december 31, 2018. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-u.s. plans is determined in a similar manner to the u.s. plans.
another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. we estimate the assumed discount rate for u.s. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount
39
general motors company and subsidiaries rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.
the society of actuaries (soa) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended december 31, 2018. we reviewed our recent mortality experience and have updated our base mortality assumptions in the u.s. this change in assumption decreased the december 31, 2018 u.s. pension and opeb plans' obligations by $0.3 billion. we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our december 31, 2018 u.s. pension and opeb plans obligations.
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $4.7 billion and $4.0 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017. the year-over-year change is primarily due to lower than expected asset returns partially offset by the increase in discount rates. at december 31, 2018 $2.1 billion of the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor (primarily 10% of the projected benefit obligation (pbo)) and subject to amortization. the weighted-average amortization period is approximately sixteen years resulting in amortization expense of $0.1 billion in 2019.
the underfunded status of the u.s. pension plans decreased by $0.7 billion in the year ended december 31, 2018 to $5.1 billion due primarily to: (1) a favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of $4.1 billion; and (2) other favorable changes including contributions, demographic gains and assumption changes of $0.3 billion; partially offset by (3) service and interest cost of $2.3 billion; and (4) an unfavorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $1.4 billion.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances.

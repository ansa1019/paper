item 1a.   risk factors.

the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations.
business and industry risks commercial truck market demand is variable. the company's business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves. negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the company's equipment and services. the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves, which are principally north america and europe. demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors.
competition and prices. the company operates in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect the company's sales and pricing. financial results depend largely on the ability to develop, manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand.
production costs and supplier capacity. the company's products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the company's financial results or use of its production capacity. many of the company's suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers, and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company. supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers' products exceeds their production capacity. unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase the company's cost of doing business or disrupt the company's or its suppliers' operations.
liquidity risks, credit ratings and costs of funds. disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the company's sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of customers, dealers and suppliers. a lowering of the company's credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets. the company's financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt. if the markets for commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future, the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets. this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers.
the financial services industry is highly competitive. the company's financial services segment competes with banks, other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing, higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates, which may lead to decreased margins, lower market share or both. a decline in the company's truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the company's financial services segment.
the financial services segment is subject to credit risk. the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer, dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans, leases and derivative contracts with the company. although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral, in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company, there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company, resulting in credit losses.
interest-rate risks. the financial services segment is subject to interest-rate risks, because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products, increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins. pfs uses derivative contracts to match the interest rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates.
7
information technology. the company relies on information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of its business processes and activities. these computer systems and networks may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; computer viruses; or outside parties attempting to disrupt the company's business or gain unauthorized access to the company's electronic data. the company maintains and continues to invest in protections to guard against such events. examples of these protections include conducting third-party penetration tests, implementing software detection and prevention tools, event monitoring, and disaster recoverability. additionally the company maintains a cybersecurity insurance policy. despite these safeguards, there remains a risk of system disruptions, unauthorized access and data loss.
if the company's computer systems were to be damaged, disrupted or breached, it could impact data availability and integrity, result in a theft of the company's intellectual property or lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of the company's customers, suppliers and employees. security breaches could also result in a violation of u.s. and international privacy and other laws and subject the company to various litigations and governmental proceedings. these events could have an adverse impact on the company's results of operations and financial condition, damage its reputation, disrupt operations and negatively impact competitiveness in the marketplace.
political, regulatory and economic risks multinational operations. the company's global operations are exposed to political, economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates. the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities, fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems, natural calamities, wars, terrorism and labor strikes. changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the company's products, financial results and competitive position. paccar's global operations are subject to extensive trade, competition and anti-corruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs.
u.k. exit from the european union. in march 2017, the united kingdom (u.k.) invoked article 50 of their treaty with the european union signaling their intent to leave the eu. under the eu treaty the u.k. had two years to negotiate terms of their exit with the eu. although a preliminary agreement between the eu and the u.k. government was made, it was not ratified by the u.k. parliament. if the terms of the exit from the eu are not agreed by march 29, 2019, it is anticipated that the standard trade protocols of the world trade organization (wto) would become effective ("hard brexit").
the company manufactures medium- and heavy-duty daf trucks in the u.k. which are sold primarily in the u.k. and to a lesser extent in europe and other world markets. in 2018, approximately 10% of the company's worldwide truck production was manufactured in the u.k. most of the truck components used in the manufacturing of trucks in the u.k., as well as aftermarket parts are sourced from the eu. in the event of a hard brexit, it is anticipated that there would be an increase in tariffs from truck components and parts from the eu which would increase the cost of all trucks and parts in the u.k. it is expected that there would also be an increase in tariffs on trucks sold from the u.k. to the eu which would lead to higher costs for trucks imported from the u.k into the eu. the imposition of tariffs and border controls would most likely lead to longer lead times in the supply chain from the eu and the u.k. in the event of a hard brexit, the company anticipates that after a period of time, changes would be made to the supply chain to minimize the effects of tariffs and delays. the higher cost of trucks and parts may impact manufacturing and parts sales and margins which could have an adverse impact on the company's results of operations.
environmental regulations. the company's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs. the company could experience higher research and development and manufacturing costs due to changes in government requirements for its products, including changes in emissions, fuel, greenhouse gas or other regulations.
litigation, product liability and regulatory. the company's products are subject to recall for environmental, performance and safety-related issues. product recalls, lawsuits, regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the company's costs and lower profits. due to the international nature of the company's business, some products are also subject to international trade regulations, including customs and import / export related laws and regulations, government embargoes and sanctions prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries, as well as anti-corruption laws. the company's reputation and its brand names are valuable assets, and claims or regulatory actions, even if unsuccessful or without merit, could adversely affect the company's reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity.
currency exchange and translation. the company's consolidated financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries. currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company's assets, liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk, as reported in the company's financial statements. the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce, but not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
8
accounting estimates. in the preparation of the company's financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. certain of these estimates, judgments and assumptions, such as residual values on operating leases, the allowance for credit losses and product warranty are particularly sensitive. if actual results are different from estimates used by management, they may have a material impact on the financial statements. for additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates, see "critical accounting policies" under item 7 of this form 10-k.
taxes. changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates impact the company's effective tax rate. changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the company's provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

peterbilt launched its new model 579 ultraloft in the first quarter of 2018, which offers customers a high-roof, integrated cab and sleeper that enhances driver comfort and operational efficiency. the ultraloft dimensions represent an 18% increase in interior space giving drivers best-in-class living quarters. the model 579 ultraloft is an excellent tractor for long-haul routes, team driving and driver training.
kenworth introduced the w990 in the third quarter of 2018. this new conventional truck is designed to maximize performance in many customer applications including over-the-road and vocational. the kenworth model w990 features the paccar mx-13 engine rated up to 510-hp and 1,850 lb-ft of torque, the 12-speed paccar automated transmission, paccar tandem rear axles, and the kenworth trucktech+ connected truck system.
daf highlighted its leadership in fuel efficiency and advanced powertrain technology by displaying a full range of innovative vehicles at the iaa truck show in hannover, germany. daf showcased its cf electric and lf electric heavy- and medium-duty urban distribution vehicles. daf also presented its cf hybrid vehicle with the paccar mx-11 engine that delivers zero emissions in urban areas.
paccar parts continues to add global parts distribution capacity to deliver industry-leading availability and to support the growth of paccar mx engine parts sales and the global fleet service program. a new 160,000 square-foot distribution center in toronto, ontario, canada opened in october 2018.

paccar has been honored as a global leader in environmental practices by environmental reporting firm cdp, earning recognition on the 2018 cdp climate change a list. every year, over 6,000 companies disclose data about their environmental impacts, risks and opportunities to cdp for independent assessment. reporting companies receive scores of a to d- rating their effectiveness in tackling climate change and other environmental issues. paccar earned a cdp score of "a", which places paccar in the top 2% of reporting companies.
in january 2019, paccar displayed innovative electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks at the ces 2019 show in las vegas, nevada. ces is one of the world's largest showcases for technological innovation. paccar exhibited three zero emission vehicles: a battery-electric peterbilt model 579ev; a battery-electric peterbilt model 220ev; and a hydrogen fuel cell electric kenworth t680 developed in collaboration with toyota. these trucks are designed for a range of customer applications, including over-the-road transportation, port operations and urban distribution. paccar was the only commercial vehicle manufacturer displaying trucks at ces.
truck outlook truck industry retail sales in the u.s. and canada in 2019 are expected to increase to 285,000 to 315,000 units compared to 284,800 in 2018. in europe, the 2019 truck industry registrations for over 16-tonne vehicles are expected to be 290,000 to 320,000 units compared to 318,800 in 2018. in south america, heavy-duty truck industry sales in 2019 are estimated to increase to 100,000 to 110,000 units compared to 88,500 units in 2018.
parts outlook in 2019, paccar parts sales are expected to grow 5-8% compared to 2018 sales.
financial services outlook based on the truck market outlook, average earning assets in 2019 are expected to increase 3-5% compared to 2018. current high levels of freight tonnage, freight rates and fleet utilization are contributing to customers' profitability and cash flow. if current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels and new business volume would likely decline.
capital spending and r&d outlook capital investments in 2019 are expected to be $525 to $575 million, and r&d is expected to be $320 to $350 million. the company is investing for long-term growth in new truck models, integrated powertrains including zero emission electrification and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, enhanced aerodynamic truck designs, advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity, and expanded manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.

the company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its financial services operations. the company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. the company's modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. when considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. when the company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (tdr).

in 2018, total modification activity decreased compared to 2017, reflecting lower modifications for insignificant delays, credit - no concession and credit - tdrs, partially offset by higher commercial modifications. the increase in modifications for commercial reasons primarily reflects higher volumes of refinancing. the decrease in modifications for insignificant delay reflects fewer fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. the decrease in modifications for credit - no concession is primarily due to lower volumes of refinancing for customers in financial difficulty. credit - tdr modifications decreased to $13.1 million in 2018 from $20.5 million in 2017 mainly due to the contract modifications for two fleet customers in 2017.

other other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment. other also includes non-service cost components of pension (income) expense and a portion of corporate expense. other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2018 and 2017. other sg&a was $70.4 million in 2018 and $50.4 million in 2017. the increase in other sg&a was primarily due to higher compensation costs.
other income before tax decreased to $2.7 million in 2018 from $12.5 million in 2017 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses, partially offset by improved results in the winch business.
investment income increased to $60.9 million in 2018 from $35.3 million in 2017, primarily due to higher average portfolio balances and higher yields on u.s. investments due to higher market interest rates.
income taxes in 2018, the effective tax rate was 21.9% compared to 22.9% in 2017, reflecting the reduced federal tax rate of 21% enacted on december 22, 2017. the company's effective tax rate for 2018 was impacted by a one-time reduction in tax liability related to extended warranty contracts and higher realized r&d tax credits.

new loan and lease volume was $4.33 billion in 2017 compared to $4.22 billion in 2016, primarily due to higher truck deliveries in 2017. pfs finance market share on new paccar truck sales was 24.9% in 2017 compared to 26.7% in 2016.
pfs revenues increased to $1.27 billion in 2017 from $1.19 billion in 2016. the increase was primarily due to higher average operating lease earning assets, and higher used truck sales, partially offset by unfavorable effects of currency translation, which decreased pfs revenues by $.6 million in 2017.
pfs income before income taxes decreased to $261.7 million in 2017 from $305.7 million in 2016, primarily due to lower results on returned lease assets, higher borrowing rates, a higher provision for losses on receivables, and the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by higher average earning asset balances. the currency exchange impact decreased pfs income before income taxes by $1.2 million in 2017.

included in financial services "other assets" on the company's consolidated balance sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of $221.7 million at december 31, 2017 and $267.2 million at december 31, 2016. these trucks are primarily units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also includes trucks acquired from repossessions or through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales.
the company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $45.1 million in 2017 compared to $16.4 million in 2016, including losses on multiple unit transactions of $29.2 million in 2017 compared to $6.8 million in 2016. used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were $5.1 million and $3.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

•   average finance receivables increased $89.1 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2017 as a result of retail portfolio new business volume exceeding collections.

•   average debt balances increased $130.6 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2017. the higher average debt balances reflect funding for a higher average earning assets portfolio, which includes loans, finance leases, wholesale and equipment on operating lease.

•   higher portfolio yields (4.81% in 2017 compared to 4.77% in 2016) increased interest and fees by $5.3 million. the higher portfolio yields reflect higher lending volumes in north america which have higher market rates than europe.

•   higher borrowing rates (1.7% in 2017 compared to 1.5% in 2016) were primarily due to higher debt market rates in north america, partially offset by lower debt market rates in europe.

•   the currency translation effects reflect a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the mexican peso and the british pound, partially offset by a strengthening euro.

•   a higher volume of used truck sales increased operating lease, rental and other revenues by $9.7 million and increased depreciation and other expenses by $8.5 million.

•   results on returned lease assets increased depreciation and other expenses by $31.0 million, primarily due to higher losses on sales of returned lease units.

•   average operating lease assets increased $223.8 million (excluding foreign exchange effects), which increased revenues by $56.5 million and related depreciation and other expenses by $47.9 million.

•   revenue per asset increased $5.5 million primarily due to higher rental income. cost per asset increased $5.1 million due to higher depreciation expense, partially offset by lower vehicle operating expenses.

the company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its financial services operations. the company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. the company's modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. when considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. when the company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (tdr).

in 2017, total modification activity decreased compared to 2016, reflecting lower volumes of refinancing for commercial reasons, primarily in the u.s. the decrease in modifications for insignificant delay reflects fewer fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. credit - tdr modifications decreased to $20.5 million in 2017 from $31.6 million in 2016 mainly due to the contract modifications for two fleet customers in 2016.

accounts 30+ days past due were .5% at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, reflecting lower past dues in europe as well as mexico, australia and other, offset by an increase in the u.s. and canada. the company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.
when the company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. the company modified $.6 million and $2.6 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively, which were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:

modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at december 31, 2017 and 2016. the effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at december 31, 2017 and 2016.
the company's 2017 and 2016 annualized pre-tax return on average assets for financial services was 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively. the decrease was due primarily to higher losses on used trucks in 2017.

other other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment. other also includes the ec charge, non-service cost components of pension (income) expense and a portion of corporate expense. other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2017 and 2016. other sg&a was $50.4 million in 2017 and $44.2 million in 2016. the increase in other sg&a was primarily due to higher labor related costs.
other income (loss) before tax was an income of $12.5 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $852.4 million in 2016, which included the impact of the $833.0 million ec charge.
investment income increased to $35.3 million in 2017 from $27.6 million in 2016, primarily due to higher average u.s. portfolio balances and higher yields on u.s. investments due to higher market interest rates.
income taxes in 2017, the effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 53.8% in 2016. the lower rate is due to the 2017 one-time impact from the change in u.s. tax law as explained below and the unfavorable 2016 impact of the one-time non-deductible expense of $833.0 million for the ec charge.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted new federal income tax legislation, the tax cuts and jobs act ("the tax act"). the tax act lowered the u.s. statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a one-time transition tax on the company's foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from u.s. income tax and created a modified territorial system. as a result, the company recorded a provisional amount of $304.0 million of deferred tax benefits, due to the re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities at the new lower statutory tax rate. in addition, the company recorded a provisional amount of $130.6 million of tax expense on the company's foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from u.s. income tax.

2018 compared to 2017:
operating activities: cash provided by operations increased by $276.5 million to $2.99 billion in 2018 from $2.72 billion in 2017. higher operating cash flows reflect higher net income of $2.20 billion in 2018 compared to $1.68 billion in 2017, which includes a net deferred tax benefit of $173.9 million primarily due to the 2017 tax act. additionally, there were higher cash inflows of $195.3 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses as purchases of goods and services exceeded payments. the higher cash inflows were offset by a higher increase in financial services segment wholesale receivables of $240.3 million and a higher increase in net purchases of inventory of $182.8 million. in addition, the higher cash inflows were offset by an increase of $98.9 million in sales-type finance leases and dealer direct loans, whereby originations exceeded cash receipts in 2018 ($27.0 million) compared to cash receipts exceeding origination in 2017 ($71.9 million). the higher cash inflows were also offset by a net change in derivatives of $82.5 million which was mainly related to the settlement of matured interest rate contracts.
investing activities: cash used in investing activities decreased by $33.9 million to $1.93 billion in 2018 from $1.96 billion in 2017. lower net cash used in investing activities reflects a $506.4 million increase from marketable debt securities, as there were $315.6 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities in 2018 compared to $190.8 million in net purchases of marketable debt securities in 2017. in addition, there were higher proceeds from asset disposals of $183.0 million. the inflows were partially offset by higher net originations from retail loans and direct financing leases of $541.8 million, higher cash used in the acquisition of equipment on operating leases of $71.5 million, and higher payments for property, plant and equipment of $34.2 million.
financing activities: cash provided by financing activities was $71.1 million in 2018 compared to cash used in financing activities of $393.8 million in 2017. in 2018, the company issued $2.34 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.76 billion and increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $625.9 million. in 2017, the company issued $1.67 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.90 billion and increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $352.1 million. this resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $1.21 billion in 2018, $1.09 billion higher than the cash provided by borrowing activities of $125.2 million in 2017. the company paid $804.3 million in dividends in 2018 compared to $558.3 million in 2017; the increase of $246.0 million was primarily due to a special dividend paid in january 2018 that was higher than the special dividend paid in january 2017. in 2018, the company also repurchased 5.8 million shares of common stock for $354.4 million. there were no stock repurchases in 2017.
2017 compared to 2016:
operating activities: cash provided by operations increased by $415.0 million to $2.72 billion in 2017. higher operating cash flows reflect higher net income of $1.68 billion in 2017, compared to net income of $521.7 million in 2016, which includes payment of the $833.0 million ec charge. in addition, there were higher cash inflows of $342.2 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses as purchases of goods and services exceeded payments. the higher cash inflows were offset by wholesale receivables on new trucks of $673.6 million as originations exceeded cash receipts in 2017 ($272.0 million) compared to cash receipts exceeding originations in 2016 ($401.6 million). additionally, there was a higher cash usage of $214.0 million from inventory due to $149.9 million in net inventory purchases in 2017 versus $64.1 million in net inventory reductions in 2016. finally, there was a higher cash outflow for payment of income taxes of $160.0 million.
30
investing activities: cash used in investing activities increased by $400.3 million to $1.96 billion in 2017 from $1.56 billion in 2016. higher net cash used in investing activities reflects $463.7 million in marketable debt securities as there was $190.8 million in net purchases of marketable debt securities in 2017 compared to $272.9 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities in 2016. in addition, there were higher net originations of retail loans and direct financing leases of $87.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. the outflows were partially offset by lower cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of $166.5 million.
financing activities: cash used in financing activities was $393.8 million in 2017 compared to cash used in financing activities of $823.5 million in 2016. the company paid $558.3 million in dividends in 2017 compared to $829.3 million in 2016; the decrease of $271.0 million was primarily due to a lower special dividend paid in january 2017 than the special dividend paid in january 2016. in 2016, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $70.5 million, while there were no stock repurchases in 2017. in 2017, the company issued $1.67 billion of term debt, increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $352.1 million and repaid term debt of $1.90 billion. in 2016, the company issued $1.99 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.63 billion and reduced its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $322.8 million. this resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $125.2 million in 2017, $78.3 million higher than the cash provided by borrowing activities of $46.9 million in 2016.
credit lines and other:
the company has line of credit arrangements of $3.50 billion, of which $3.27 billion were unused at december 31, 2018. included in these arrangements are $3.00 billion of syndicated bank facilities, of which $1.00 billion expires in june 2019, $1.00 billion expires in june 2022 and $1.00 billion expires in june 2023. the company intends to replace these credit facilities on or before expiration with facilities of similar amounts and duration. these credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. there were no borrowings under the syndicated bank facilities for the year ended december 31, 2018.
as of june 30, 2018, the company completed the repurchase of $300.0 million of the company's common stock under the authorization approved in september 2015. on july 9, 2018, paccar's board of directors approved another plan to repurchase up to $300.0 million of the company's outstanding common stock. as of december 31, 2018, $260.1 million of shares have been repurchased under this plan. on december 4, 2018, the company's board of directors approved a plan to repurchase an additional $500.0 million of paccar's outstanding common stock upon completion of the prior plan.
truck, parts and other the company provides funding for working capital, capital expenditures, r&d, dividends, stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations. management expects this method of funding to continue in the future.
over the past decade, the company's combined investments in worldwide capital projects and r&d totaled $6.04 billion, and have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and enhanced the quality and operating efficiency of the company's premium products.
capital investments in 2019 are expected to be $525 to $575 million, and r&d is expected to be $320 to $350 million. the company is investing for long-term growth in new truck models, integrated powertrains including zero emission electrification and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, enhanced aerodynamic truck designs, advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity, and expanded manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.
the company conducts business in certain countries which have been experiencing or may experience significant financial stress, fiscal or political strain and are subject to the corresponding potential for default. the company routinely monitors its financial exposure to global financial conditions, global counterparties and operating environments. as of december 31, 2018, the company's exposures in such countries were insignificant.
financial services the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets and, to a lesser extent, bank loans. an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies.
31
the company issues commercial paper for a portion of its funding in its financial services segment. some of this commercial paper is converted to fixed interest rate debt through the use of interest-rate swaps, which are used to manage interest-rate risk.
in november 2018, the company's u.s. finance subsidiary, paccar financial corp. (pfc), filed a shelf registration under the securities act of 1933. the total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for pfc as of december 31, 2018 was $4.90 billion. the registration expires in november 2021 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period.
as of december 31, 2018, the company's european finance subsidiary, paccar financial europe, had €1.35 billion available for issuance under a €2.50 billion medium-term note program listed on the professional securities market of the london stock exchange. this program replaced an expiring program in the second quarter of 2018 and is renewable annually through the filing of new listing particulars.
in april 2016, paccar financial mexico registered a 10.00 billion peso medium-term note and commercial paper program with the comision nacional bancaria y de valores. the registration expires in april 2021 and limits the amount of commercial paper (up to one year) to 5.00 billion pesos. at december 31, 2018, 7.75 billion pesos were available for issuance.
in august 2018, the company's australian subsidiary, paccar financial pty. ltd. (pfpl), registered a medium-term note program. the program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. the total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for pfpl as of december 31, 2018 was 150.0 million australian dollars.
in the event of a future significant disruption in the financial markets, the company may not be able to issue replacement commercial paper. as a result, the company is exposed to liquidity risk from the shorter maturity of short-term borrowings paid to lenders compared to the longer timing of receivable collections from customers. the company believes its cash balances and investments, collections on existing finance receivables, syndicated bank lines and current investment-grade credit ratings of a+/a1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability. a decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the company's ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the company's ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability. paccar believes its financial services companies will be able to continue funding receivables, servicing debt and paying dividends through internally generated funds, access to public and private debt markets and lines of credit.

reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial measures:
this form 10-k includes "adjusted net income (non-gaap)" and "adjusted net income per diluted share (non-gaap)", which are financial measures that are not in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), since they exclude the one-time tax benefit from the tax cuts and jobs act ("the tax act") in 2017 and the non-recurring european commission charge in 2016. these measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-gaap financial measures used by other companies. in addition, the form 10-k includes the financial ratios noted below calculated based on non-gaap measures.
management utilizes these non-gaap measures to evaluate the company's performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding significant non-recurring items that are not representative of underlying operating trends.
reconciliations from the most directly comparable gaap measures of adjusted net income (non-gaap) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-gaap) are as follows:

impact of environmental matters:
the company, its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment. the company believes its policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred.
the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters. in certain of these matters, the company has been designated as a "potentially responsible party" by domestic and foreign environmental agencies. the company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future. expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $1.2 million, $1.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively. while the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined, management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the company's consolidated cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
34
critical accounting policies:
the company's significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements. in the preparation of the company's financial statements, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. the following are accounting policies which, in the opinion of management, are particularly sensitive and which, if actual results are different from estimates used by management, may have a material impact on the financial statements.
operating leases trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note f of the consolidated financial statements. in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles, the company considers the length of the lease term, the truck model, the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand. operating lease terms generally range from three to five years. the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30% and 70% of original equipment cost. if the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the company's estimated residual value, a gain or loss will result.
future market conditions, changes in government regulations and other factors outside the company's control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts. residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant. a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term.
during 2018, 2017 and 2016, market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally lower than the residual values on the equipment, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of $31.0 million, $45.5 million and $9.6 million, respectively.
at december 31, 2018, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was $2.41 billion. a 10% decrease in used truck values worldwide, if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the company's operating leases, would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording an average of approximately $69 million of additional depreciation per year.
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses related to the company's loans and finance leases is disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements. the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. the retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and sales-type finance leases, net of unearned interest. the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer's financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases, obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets. in determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest, generally over three to five years, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves.
the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment. finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled. in addition, all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired. generally, impaired accounts are on non-accrual status. impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments.
impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent. large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral. when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the company's recorded investment, no reserve is recorded. small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below.

the company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data and current market conditions. information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse. the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the company's borrowers and their ability to repay. after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management's estimate of incurred credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio.
the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions. as accounts become past due, the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases. the company's experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 30% and 70%. over the past three years, the company's year-end 30+ days past due accounts have ranged between .4% and .5% of loan and lease receivables. historically, a 100 basis point increase in the 30+ days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 3 to 39 basis points of receivables. at december 31, 2018, 30+ days past dues were .4%. if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 1.4% as of december 31, 2018, the company's estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of $2 to $33 million depending on the extent of the past dues, the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors.
product warranty product warranty is disclosed in note i of the consolidated financial statements. the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of recoveries. management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through quality-improvement programs; however, actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve. historically those adjustments have not been material. over the past three years, warranty expense as a percentage of truck, parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 1.3% and 1.6%. if the 2018 warranty expense had been .2% higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2018, warranty expense would have increased by approximately $44.3 million.

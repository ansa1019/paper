item 1a. risk factors the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. the information set forth in this item 1a "risk factors" should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report, including item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters could affect us, our customers, and the markets we serve. congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry. railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb, which has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb, whether under new or existing laws, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to negotiate prices for rail services, on railway operating revenues, and on the efficiency of our operations. this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines.
railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the dot and the dhs (which regulate most aspects of our operations) related to safety and security. the rail safety improvement act of 2008, the surface transportation extension act of 2015, and the implementing regulations promulgated by the fra (collectively "the ptc laws and regulations") require us (and each other class i railroad) to implement, on certain mainline track where intercity and commuter passenger railroads operate and where tih hazardous materials are k 10
transported, an interoperable positive train control system (ptc). ptc is a set of highly advanced technologies designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, speed-related derailments, and certain other accidents caused by human error, but ptc will not prevent all types of train accidents or incidents. we have met the december 31, 2018 deadline under the ptc laws and regulations to install all hardware and to implement ptc on some of those rail lines. the ptc laws and regulations also require us to fully implement ptc on the remainder of those rail lines by december 31, 2020. in addition, other railroads' implementation schedules could impose additional interoperability requirements and accelerated timelines on us, which could impact our operations over other railroads if not met.
full implementation of ptc will result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures, and ptc implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses, and increased claims and litigation costs.
our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. the risk of incurring environmental liability, for acts and omissions, past, present, and future, is inherent in the railroad business. this risk includes property owned by us, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants.
environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these properties. moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.
concern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on ghg emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs, decrease the amount of traffic handled, and decrease the value of coal reserves we own.
in addition, legislation and regulation related to ghgs could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers. even without legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry and our customers that (1) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, including coal, (2) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (3) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy.
as a common carrier by rail, we must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk. transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property (including environmental) damage, and compromise critical parts of our rail network. the cost of a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage. we have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages (see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements); however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.
we may be affected by general economic conditions. prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions could affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry. economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers.
significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and locomotives. in addition, workforce demographics and training requirements, particularly for engineers and conductors, could have a negative impact on our ability to meet short-term demand for rail service. unpredicted increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks.
k 11
we may be affected by energy prices. volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including, but not limited to: the economy; demand for transportation services; business related to the energy sector, including crude oil, natural gas, and coal; fuel prices; and fuel surcharges.
we face competition from other transportation providers. we are subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time, pricing, and quality and reliability of service. while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. any future improvements, expenditures, legislation, or regulation materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate (such as granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption of autonomous commercial vehicles) could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations. our ability to provide rail service to customers in the u.s. and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers (including shortlines and regional railroads) with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers, or in our relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in our inability to meet our customers' demands or require us to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies. additionally, any significant consolidations, mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach.
we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations. if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could experience a service interruption, a security breach, or other operational difficulties. we also face cybersecurity threats which may result in breaches of systems, or compromises of sensitive data, which may result in an inability to access or operate systems necessary for conducting operations and providing customer service, thereby impacting our efficiency and/or damaging our corporate reputation. additionally, if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service.
the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations. approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. if unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations. additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase our costs for health care, wages, and other benefits.
we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters. job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer's liability act (fela), which is applicable only to railroads. fela's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system. the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded.
any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss, property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent not covered by insurance. we have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-
k 12
party property damages; however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.
severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures. severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods, fires, and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues.
we may be affected by terrorism or war. any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption. because we play a critical role in the nation's transportation system, we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government's preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.
although we currently maintain insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism, we maintain only limited insurance coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in our care, custody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism. in addition, premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future.
we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets. we consumed approximately 472 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2018. fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies.
due to the capital intensive nature, as well as the industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment. additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials. changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials.
the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity. we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, including the issuance of debt instruments, as well as the sale of certain receivables. significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial position due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds. instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial position, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes.
overview we are one of the nation's premier transportation companies.  our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 19,500 route miles in 22 states and the district of columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern united states, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.  norfolk southern is a major transporter of industrial products, including chemicals, agriculture, and metals and construction materials. in addition, the railroad operates the most extensive intermodal network in the east and is a principal carrier of coal, automobiles, and automotive parts.
we achieved records for income from railway operations and railway operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses) for the year, the result of significant revenue growth, partially offset by increased operating expenses. progress on our strategic initiatives established in 2015 has created a sustainable platform positioning us for the continued execution of transformational changes that will provide greater long-term value for our shareholders.

on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax reform") was signed into law. as a result of the enactment of this law, in 2017, "purchased services and rents" included a $151 million benefit and "income taxes" included a $3,331 million benefit, which added $3,482 million to "net income" and $12.00 to "diluted earnings per share." the 2017 operating ratio was favorably impacted by 1.5 percentage points. for more information on the impact of tax reform, see note 4.
the following table adjusts our 2017 gaap financial results to exclude the effects of tax reform, specifically, the effects of remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities related to the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% (the "2017 tax adjustments"). we use these non-gaap financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making period-to-period comparisons by excluding the 2017 tax adjustments. while we believe that these non-gaap financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, these non-gaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.

income from railway operations rose in both comparisons resulting from higher railway operating revenues that more than offset higher expenses. revenue growth of 9% and 7% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, was tempered by increased adjusted operating expenses of 4% in both periods. in addition to higher income from railway operations, net income and diluted earnings per share growth in 2018 also benefited from a lower effective tax rate, primarily due to the enactment of tax reform. finally, our share repurchase programs in both years resulted in diluted earnings per share growth that exceeded that of net income.

most of our contracts include negotiated fuel surcharges, typically tied to either on-highway diesel (ohd) or west texas intermediate crude oil. approximately 90% of our revenue base is covered by these negotiated fuel surcharges, with almost 75% tied to ohd. for both 2018 and 2017, contracts tied to ohd accounted for about 90% of our fuel surcharge revenue. revenues associated with fuel surcharges totaled $657 million, $359 million, and $236 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
merchandise revenues increased in both 2018 and 2017 compared with the prior years. in 2018, revenues grew due to higher average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue, as well as higher volumes. volume gains in chemicals, agriculture, and paper, clay, and forest products were partially offset by declines in automotive and metals and construction traffic. revenue growth in 2017 was a result of higher average revenue per unit, the result of price improvements. volume was relatively flat compared to the prior year, as gains in the metals and construction group were offset by declines in automotive, agriculture, and chemicals traffic.
for 2019, merchandise revenues are expected to increase, primarily the result of pricing gains.
chemicals revenues rose in 2018 compared to a modest increase in 2017. in 2018 the rise was the result of higher volume and higher average revenue per unit, due to pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. volumes grew due to increased shipments of crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, and plastics, partially offset by a decrease in coal ash shipments. the increase in 2017 was due to higher average revenue per unit, a result of favorable mix and price improvements, which outweighed declines in volume. volume declines were the result of fewer shipments of crude oil from the bakken oil fields, lower shipments of coal ash, partially offset by an increase in shipments of plastics.
for 2019, chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase, as average revenue per unit is expected to be higher, the effect of overall pricing gains. we expect carloads to be relatively flat year-over-year, as declines in liquefied petroleum gas are expected to be offset by gains in crude oil.
agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues increased in 2018 and were flat in 2017 compared to the prior years. growth in 2018 was due to higher volume and higher average revenue per unit, a result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenues. higher ethanol and fertilizer shipments more than offset declines in soybean and corn shipments. in 2017, lower traffic volume was offset by higher revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains. volume declines in ethanol and soybeans, reflecting reduced market demand, more than offset increases in fertilizer.
k 21
for 2019, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues are expected to increase, driven by increased average revenue per unit, primarily a result of pricing gains. we expect volumes to decrease due to lower fertilizer shipments.
metals and construction revenues grew in both periods, more significantly so in 2017. in 2018, higher average revenue per unit, the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue, more than offset volume declines. volume declines in aggregates, cement, aluminum, and iron and steel were partially offset by increases in frac sand shipments for use in natural gas drilling in the marcellus and utica regions. in 2017, higher volume and average revenue per unit contributed to the rise in revenues. volume growth was a result of more frac sand shipments for use in natural gas drilling in the marcellus and utica regions and more iron and steel shipments driven by continued improvement in construction activity. these increases were partially offset by a decline in coil steel traffic due to customer sourcing changes. revenue per unit growth in 2017 was driven by favorable changes in traffic mix.
for 2019, metals and construction revenues are expected to rise, a result of increased revenue per unit driven by pricing gains, and volume growth is expected in aggregates and coil steel traffic.
automotive revenues rose in 2018, but declined in 2017 compared to the prior years. in 2018, higher average revenue per unit, driven by price increases and higher fuel surcharge revenues, more than offset volume declines. traffic declines were the result of shortages of availability of multilevel equipment and scheduled automotive plant downtime. the drop in volume in 2017 was driven mainly by decreases in u.s. light vehicle production, as well as temporary shutdowns for retooling of several ns-served facilities. average revenue per unit increased for the year, primarily the result of higher fuel surcharge revenue.
for 2019, automotive revenues are expected to increase as a result of higher volumes, reflecting increased demand at ns-served plants, and higher average revenue per unit driven by price increases.
paper, clay and forest products revenues rose in both 2018 and 2017 compared to the prior years. in 2018, higher average revenue per unit, the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue, and volume gains drove the increase. gains in pulpboard and municipal waste shipments, a result of tightened truck capacity and growth with existing customers, respectively, were partially offset by decreases in pulp, woodchip, and graphic paper traffic. the increase in 2017 was due to higher average revenue per unit, a result of pricing gains and changes in the traffic mix. traffic was flat for the year as increases in waste and pulp shipments were offset by losses in woodchip volume due to customer sourcing changes.
for 2019, paper, clay, and forest products revenues are anticipated to increase, reflecting pricing gains. we expect volume to decline slightly, as gains in lumber traffic are expected to be offset by declines in wood chips and graphic paper.
intermodal revenues increased considerably in both 2018 and 2017 compared to the prior years. the rise in 2018 was driven by higher average revenue per unit, a result of increased fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains, and higher volume. growth in 2017 was the result of higher volume and higher average revenue per unit, due to higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains.
for 2019, we expect intermodal revenues to rise, the result of increased domestic volumes and higher average revenue per unit, driven by rate increases.

domestic volume increased in both periods. the rise in 2018 benefited from continued highway conversions due to tighter capacity in the truck market, higher truckload pricing, and growth from existing accounts. in 2017, continued highway conversions and growth from existing accounts drove the increase.
for 2019, we expect higher domestic volumes driven by continued highway conversions and growth from existing accounts.
international volume increased in both years reflecting increased demand from existing customers.
for 2019, we expect continued growth in our international volume largely driven by more traffic from existing customers.
coal revenues increased in 2018 and significantly so in 2017 compared with the prior years. revenue growth in 2018 was the result of higher average revenue per unit, largely the result of pricing gains, which more than offset volume declines. the increase in 2017 was a result of higher volume, primarily in the export market, and higher revenue per unit, driven by higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains.
for 2019, coal revenues are expected to remain relatively flat year-over-year. higher export and domestic metallurgical volumes are expected to be offset by lower revenue per unit, primarily the result of lower pricing in our export market.

utility coal tonnage declined in 2018, driven by lower network velocity, decreased coal supply, inclement weather in the first quarter, and plant outages. tonnage rose in 2017, driven by market share gains, partially offset by limited coal burn due to milder weather. both periods were negatively impacted by sustained lower natural gas prices.
k 23
for 2019, we expect utility tonnage to be relatively flat year-over-year, the result of continued pressure from natural gas prices and continued expected growth in renewable and natural gas capacity.
export coal tonnage increased in both periods due to strong seaborne pricing that resulted in higher demand for u.s. coal. volume through norfolk was up 2.3 million tons, or 15%, in 2018 and 5.5 million tons, or 57%, in 2017. volume through baltimore declined 0.8 million tons, or 7%, in 2018, but rose 6.4 million tons, or 129%, in 2017.
for 2019, we expect export coal tonnage to rise due to continued demand for u.s. coal.
domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was down slightly in 2018, but up in 2017. the decline in 2018 was a reflection of customer sourcing changes. in 2017, the increase was a result of market share gains.
for 2019, domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to grow due to increased demand in domestic steel production.
industrial coal tonnage decreased in both years. in 2018, the decrease reflected customer sourcing changes and pressure from natural gas conversions. the drop in 2017 was a result of plant outages, natural gas conversions, and decreased coal burn.
for 2019, industrial coal tonnage is expected to decrease as a result of continued pressure from natural gas conversions and customer sourcing changes.

compensation and benefits decreased in 2018, reflecting changes in:
•   employment levels (down $61 million),
•   health and welfare benefit rates for agreement employees (down $34 million),
•   employment tax refund ($31 million benefit),
•   incentive and stock-based compensation (down $7 million),
•   pay rates (up $34 million), and
•   overtime and recrews (up $58 million).
in 2017, compensation and benefits increased, a result of changes in:
•   incentive and stock-based compensation (up $125 million),
•   higher health and welfare benefit rates for agreement employees (up $62 million),
•   pay rates (up $43 million),
•   increased overtime (up $24 million), and

the increase in purchased services in 2018 was largely the result of the absence of the benefit from the 2017 tax adjustments, higher intermodal volume-related costs, additional transportation and engineering activities as well as higher technology costs. in addition to the tax reform impacts discussed above, the remaining increase in purchased services expense in 2017 was a result of higher intermodal volume-related costs.
equipment rents, which includes our cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment, increased in 2018, but decreased in 2017. in 2018, the rise was due to the absence of the benefits from the 2017 tax adjustments, the impact of slower network velocity, the cost of additional short-term locomotive resources as well as growth in volume. in 2017, in addition to the benefit from the 2017 tax adjustments, the decline was a result of lower automotive volume.
fuel expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, increased in both periods. the change in both years was principally due to locomotive fuel prices (up 25% in 2018 and up 22% in 2017) which increased expenses $208 million and $143 million, respectively. locomotive fuel consumption increased 3% in 2018, but declined 1% in 2017. we consumed approximately 472 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2018, compared with 458 million gallons in 2017 and 462 million gallons in 2016.
depreciation expense increased in both periods, a reflection of growth in our roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock.

materials expense increased in 2018, due primarily to higher locomotive repair costs. in 2017, the decline was a result of lower freight car repairs.
casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters. the 2018 expense increased, primarily the result of higher derailment-related costs. the decrease in 2017 was the result of lower loss and damage, offset in part by unfavorable developments in personal injury cases.
other expense decreased in both periods, largely a result of higher gains from sales of operating properties, up $79 million and $42 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared to the prior periods. in 2018, the decline was additionally impacted by the inclusion of net rental income from operating property previously included in "other income - net" of $78 million, partially offset by increased costs as a result of the relocation of our train dispatchers to atlanta, georgia.
other income - net other income - net decreased in 2018, following an increase in 2017. the decline was driven by the absence of net rental income as discussed above and unfavorable returns from corporate-owned life insurance (coli) investments. in 2017, the rise was mainly the result of favorable returns on coli investments.
income taxes the effective income tax rate was 23.1% in 2018, compared with negative 72.8% in 2017 and 35.4% in 2016.  income taxes in 2018 benefited from the effects of the enactment of tax reform in late 2017 that lowered the federal corporate income tax rate.  income taxes in 2017 included a benefit of $3,331 million related to the effects of the enactment of tax reform from the reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities driven by the change in the federal rate.  all three years benefited from favorable tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.  both 2018 and 2016 benefited from favorable reductions in deferred taxes for state tax law changes and certain business tax credits, while 2017 and 2016 benefited from higher returns from corporate-owned life insurance.
the statute of limitations on internal revenue service (irs) examinations has expired for all years prior to 2015.  our consolidated federal income tax return for 2015 is currently being audited by the irs.  we do not expect that the resolution of the examination will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources cash provided by operating activities, our principal source of liquidity, was $3.7 billion in 2018, $3.3 billion in 2017, and $3.0 billion in 2016. the increases in both 2018 and 2017 were primarily the result of improved k 26
operating results. we had working capital deficits of $729 million and $396 million at december 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $446 million and $690 million at december 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations.
contractual obligations at december 31, 2018, were comprised of interest on fixed-rate long-term debt, long-term debt (note 9), unconditional purchase obligations (note 17), operating leases (note 10), long-term advances from conrail, agreements with consolidated rail corporation (crc) (note 6), and unrecognized tax benefits (note 4):

cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion in 2018, compared with $1.5 billion in 2017, and $1.8 billion in 2016.  in 2018, higher property additions drove the increase. the decline in 2017 was a reflection of lower cash outflows for property additions and a drop in corporate-owned life insurance investments.
capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the "railway property" section of part i of this report on form 10-k. for 2019, we expect capital spending to approximate 16% to 18% of revenues.
cash used in financing activities was $2.3 billion in 2018, compared with $2.0 billion in 2017, and $1.3 billion in 2016.  both year-over-year comparisons reflect increased repurchases of common stock and higher debt repayments. in 2018, the increase was also impacted by higher dividend payments, but tempered by increased proceeds from borrowings. in 2017, lower proceeds from borrowings also contributed to the rise.
share repurchases totaled $2.8 billion in 2018, $1.0 billion in 2017, and $803 million in 2016 for the purchase and retirement of 17.1 million (including 7.0 million shares repurchased for $1.2 billion under the asr program, see note 15), 8.2 million, and 9.2 million shares, respectively.  as of december 31, 2018, 39.4 million shares remain authorized by our board of directors for repurchase.  the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.
in february of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.15% senior notes due 2048. in august of 2018, we issued $300 million of 3.65% senior notes due 2025, $400 million of 3.80% senior notes due 2028, $200 million of 4.15% senior notes due 2048, and $600 million of 5.10% senior notes due 2118 (see note 9).

we discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 9, and we have authority from our board of directors to issue an additional $1.2 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale, all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise. our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 42.0% at december 31, 2018, compared with 37.5% at december 31, 2017.
upcoming annual debt maturities are disclosed in note 9.  overall, our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  these estimates and assumptions may require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.  accordingly, we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1.
pensions and other postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions (note 12).  these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans' assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.  in addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.  we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance).  we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm's studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities.
in recording our net pension benefit, we assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 8.25%, which was supported by the long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception, as well as our expectation of future returns. a one-percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $22 million change in pension expense. we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually, and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality, they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future. the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.  we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.  we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.
properties and depreciation most of our assets are long-lived railway properties (note 7).  as disclosed in note 1, the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life.  see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area.
depreciation expense for 2018 totaled $1.1 billion.  our composite depreciation rates for 2018 are disclosed in note 7; a one year increase (or decrease) in the estimated average useful lives of depreciable assets would have resulted in an approximate $40 million decrease (or increase) to depreciation expense.
k 28
personal injury casualties and other claims expense, included in "materials and other" in the consolidated statements of income, includes our accrual for personal injury liabilities.
to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year, we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm. the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences. we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study. our estimate is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded.
for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury see note 17.
income taxes our net deferred tax liability totaled $6.5 billion at december 31, 2018 (note 4).  this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.  after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.  for state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. we have a $50 million valuation allowance on $425 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2018, reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized.
other matters labor agreements approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.  pursuant to the railway labor act, these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the railway labor act are completed.  we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the national carriers conference committee.  moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements.
the 2015 bargaining round is now complete with finalized agreements in place with all employees.  all of the newly negotiated agreements have moratorium provisions that will reopen the agreements for negotiation beginning january 1, 2020.
market risks at december 31, 2018, we had no outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations. market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31, 2018, and amounts to an increase of approximately $1.4 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31, 2018. we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
new accounting pronouncements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see note 1.
k 29
inflation in preparing financial statements, gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.  as a capital-intensive company, we have most of our capital invested in long-lived assets.  the replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.
forward-looking statements certain statements in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended.  these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or our achievements or those of our industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.  in some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "would," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "project," "consider," "predict," "potential," "feel," or other comparable terminology.  we have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates, beliefs, and projections.  while we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates, beliefs, and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.  these and other important factors, including those discussed in item 1a "risk factors," may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  the forward-looking statements herein are made only as of the date they were first issued, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  copies of our press releases and additional information about us is available at www.norfolksouthern.com, or you can contact our investor relations department by calling 757-629-2861.

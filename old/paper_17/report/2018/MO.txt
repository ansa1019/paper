item 1a. risk factors.
the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations, our cash flows, our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report on form 10-k.
we (1) may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec, reports to security holders, press releases and investor webcasts. you can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "continues," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "intends," "projects," "goals," "objectives," "guidance," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans, estimates and assumptions. achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. you should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria's securities. in connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this annual report on form 10-k particularly in the "business environment" sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries' businesses below in item 7. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law.
unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries.
legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions
_________________________________________________
(1) this section uses the terms "we," "our" and "us" when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context.
4
against altria and its subsidiaries, including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees. various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, tax, contraband-related claims, patent infringement, employment matters, claims for contribution and claims of competitors, shareholders and distributors.
litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. damages claimed in some tobacco-related or other litigation are significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions of dollars. the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.
in certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants' liability is joint and several. in such cases, altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment.  as a result, altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts. furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, altria or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys' fees.
although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. this risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all. as discussed in note 19. contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 19"), tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida's bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well. such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court. although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria, or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.
in certain litigation, altria and its subsidiaries may face potentially significant non-monetary remedies, which may cause reputational harm. for example, in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice, discussed in detail in note 19, the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant non-monetary remedies, including the issuance of "corrective statements."
altria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation. nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty, and significant challenges remain.
it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria, or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges. however, altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria to do so. see item 3. legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10-k ("item 3"), note 19 and exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of pending tobacco-related litigation.
significant federal, state and local governmental actions, including actions by the fda, and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on us and our tobacco subsidiaries' businesses and sales volumes.
as described in tobacco space - business environment in item 7, our cigarette subsidiaries face significant governmental and private sector actions, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold these subsidiaries responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. these actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume, and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels.
more broadly, actions by the fda and other federal, state or local governments or agencies, including those specific actions described in tobacco space - business environment in item 7, may impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products (for example, through product standards that may be proposed by the fda for nicotine and flavors), limit adult tobacco consumer choices, delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk, require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace (for example as a result of product contamination, rulemaking that bans menthol, a determination by the fda that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence, because the fda requires that a currently-marketed tobacco product proceed through the pre-market review process or because the fda otherwise determines that removal is necessary for the protection of public health), restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers, restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products, create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies, impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packing requirements, interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business, or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments. any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse
5
impact on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries. see tobacco space - business environment in item 7 for a more detailed discussion.
tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation, which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria's tobacco subsidiaries.
tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes, and significant increases in tobacco product-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the federal, state and local levels. tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments or to other low-priced or low-taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria's tobacco subsidiaries. for further discussion, see tobacco space - business environment - excise taxes in item 7.
our tobacco businesses face significant competition (including across categories) and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria, or the business of altria's tobacco subsidiaries.
each of altria's tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories. this competition also exists across categories as adult tobacco consumer preferences evolve. significant methods of competition include product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging, distribution and promotional activities.  a highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability, market share and shipment volume of our tobacco subsidiaries, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria. see tobacco space - business environment - summary in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, including e-vapor products. growth of the e-vapor product category and other innovative tobacco products has further contributed to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and has adversely affected the growth rates of other tobacco products. continued growth in these categories could have a material adverse impact on the business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position of pm usa and usstc.
pm usa also faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states. these settlements, among other factors, resulted in substantial cigarette price increases. these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers' cigarettes sold in such states. additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes, and imports of foreign lowest priced brands. usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer down-trading to lower-priced brands.
altria and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences, responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of altria or the business of altria's tobacco subsidiaries.
each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences. to be successful, they must continue to:
▪   promote brand equity successfully;
▪   anticipate and respond to new and evolving adult consumer preferences;
▪   develop, manufacture, market and distribute new and innovative products that appeal to adult consumers (including, where appropriate, through arrangements with, or investments in, third parties);
▪   improve productivity; and
▪   protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases.
see tobacco space - business environment - summary in item 7 and the immediately preceding risk factor for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, specifically the growth of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products and the effects on our tobacco operating companies.
the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions. in periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may purchase more discount brands and/or, in the case of tobacco products, consider lower-priced tobacco products, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries. while our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lower-priced products, the failure to do so could negatively impact our companies' ability to compete in these circumstances.
our financial services business (conducted through pmcc) holds investments in finance leases, principally in transportation (including aircraft), power generation, real estate and manufacturing equipment. its lessees are subject to significant competition and uncertain economic conditions. if parties to pmcc's leases fail to manage through difficult economic and
6
competitive conditions, pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses, which would adversely affect our earnings.
altria's tobacco subsidiaries and investees may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing adjacent products or processes, including innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers, which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams and/or put them at a competitive disadvantage.
altria and its subsidiaries have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into adjacent products or processes, including innovative tobacco products. some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products, while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers (within and outside the united states) products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences. examples include tobacco-containing and nicotine-containing products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke and/or constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful, such as e-vapor products. these efforts include arrangements with, or investments in, third parties such as our minority investment in juul. this minority investment subjects us to non-competition obligations restricting us from investing or engaging in the e-vapor business other than through juul, subject to limited exceptions. our tobacco subsidiaries and investees may not succeed in their efforts to introduce such new products, which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams.
further, we cannot predict whether regulators, including the fda, will permit the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk to adult consumers, the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products. nor can we predict whether adult tobacco consumers' purchasing decisions would be affected by reduced risk claims if permitted. adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products.
if our tobacco subsidiaries or investees do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk, but one or more of their competitors do succeed, our tobacco subsidiaries or investees may be at a competitive disadvantage, which could have an adverse effect on their financial performance.
significant changes in price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials or component parts could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of altria's tobacco subsidiaries.
any significant change in prices, quality or availability of tobacco, other raw materials or component parts could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries' profitability and business. for further discussion, see tobacco space - business environment -
price, availability and quality of tobacco, other raw materials and component parts in item 7.
because altria's tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers, an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries.
altria's tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers. a natural or man-made disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria's tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any key suppliers of any of altria's tobacco subsidiaries, including as a result of a key supplier's unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company, could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries. an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of altria's subsidiaries or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries.
altria's subsidiaries could decide or be required to recall products, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries.
in addition to a recall required by the fda, as referenced above, our subsidiaries could decide, or other laws or regulations could require them, to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications, suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination, or other adulteration, product misbranding or product tampering. product recalls could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries.
the failure of altria's information systems or service providers' information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries.
altria and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems, many of which are managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax requirements; engaging in marketing and e-commerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating internally and externally with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult consumers and others. we continue to make investments in
7
administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyber-threats, including human error and malicious acts. our safeguards include employee training, testing and auditing protocols, backup systems and business continuity plans, maintenance of security policies and procedures, monitoring of networks and systems, and third-party risk management.
to date, interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations. however, because technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. failure of our systems or service providers' systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could result in loss of revenue, assets, personal data, intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data, violation of applicable privacy and data security laws, damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands, operational disruptions, legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria and its subsidiaries.
unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria and its subsidiaries.
from time to time, altria and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of any such investigation, and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of a future investigation.
a challenge to our tax positions could adversely affect our tax rate, earnings or cash flow.
tax laws and regulations, such as the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax reform act"), are complex and subject to varying interpretations. a successful challenge to one or more of altria's tax positions could give rise to additional liabilities, including interest and potential penalties, as well as adversely affect our tax rate, earnings or cash flows.
international business operations subject altria and its subsidiaries to various united states and foreign laws and regulations, and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs.
while altria and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states, they do engage (directly or indirectly) in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption.  although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law, no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees, investees or third parties. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs.
altria may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions.
our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions. the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance.  as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent.
acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria's credit rating, and altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction.
from time to time, altria considers acquisitions or investments and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition or investment or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in juul (although we continue to maintain investment grade ratings). any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.
furthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment.
disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect altria's access to these markets, earnings and dividend rate.
access to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability, pricing, credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.
altria may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
8
we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. this calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions, regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences, success of planned new product introductions, competitive activity and tobacco-related taxes. certain events can also trigger an immediate review of intangible assets. if an impairment is determined to exist in either situation, we will incur impairment losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. in the fourth quarter of 2018, altria incurred $209 million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to altria's decision to refocus its innovative product efforts and the impairment of the columbia crest trademark (see note 4. goodwill and other intangible assets, net to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a more detailed discussion).
competition, unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect ste. michelle's wine business.
ste. michelle's business is subject to significant competition, including from many large, well-established domestic and international companies. the adequacy of ste. michelle's grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industry-wide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions, particularly in eastern washington. supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices, which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste. michelle's sales. in addition, federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies. new regulations or revisions to existing regulations, resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste. michelle's wine business. for further discussion, see wine segment - business environment in item 7.
altria's reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in ab inbev and the dividends paid by ab inbev on shares owned by altria may be adversely affected by various factors, including foreign currency exchange rates and ab inbev's business results and stock price.
for purposes of financial reporting, the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are translated into u.s. dollars from various local currencies. in addition, ab inbev pays dividends in euros, which we convert into u.s. dollars. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar against these currencies, our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer u.s. dollars and the dividends that we receive from ab inbev will convert into fewer u.s. dollars.
dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are also subject to the risks encountered by ab inbev in its business. for example, in october 2018, ab inbev announced a 50% rebase in the dividends it pays to its shareholders, which will result in a reduction of cash dividends altria receives from ab inbev. as discussed in the discussion and analysis - critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7, if the carrying value of our investment in ab inbev exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired, which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on altria's consolidated financial position or earnings. we cannot provide any assurance that ab inbev will successfully execute its business plans and strategies. earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are also subject to fluctuations in ab inbev's stock price, for example through mark-to-market losses on ab inbev's derivative financial instruments used to hedge certain share commitments.
we received a substantial portion of our consideration from the ab inbev transaction in the form of restricted shares subject to a five-year lock-up. furthermore, if our percentage ownership in ab inbev were to decrease below certain levels, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, suffer a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the ab inbev board of directors and be unable to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting.
upon completion of the ab inbev transaction, we received a substantial portion of our consideration in the form of restricted shares that cannot be sold or transferred for a period of five years following the ab inbev transaction, subject to limited exceptions. these transfer restrictions will require us to bear the risks associated with our investment in ab inbev for a five-year period that expires on october 10, 2021. further, in the event that our ownership percentage in ab inbev were to decrease below certain levels, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the ab inbev board of directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and our use of the equity method of accounting for our investment in ab inbev could be challenged.
the tax treatment of the consideration altria received in the ab inbev transaction may be challenged and the tax treatment of the ab inbev investment may not be as favorable as altria anticipates.
while we expect the equity consideration that we received from the ab inbev transaction to qualify for tax-deferred treatment, we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and, if they do, what the outcome of any such challenge will be. in addition, there is a risk that the tax treatment of our investment in ab inbev may not be as favorable as we anticipate.
9
antitrust clearance required for the conversion of our non-voting juul shares into voting shares may not be obtained in a timely manner or at all, and the expected benefits of the juul transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all.
antitrust clearance required for the conversion of the non-voting juul shares held by us into voting shares may not be obtained in a timely manner or at all, and such clearance may be subject to unanticipated conditions. unless and until such antitrust clearance is obtained, including expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, our juul shares will not have voting rights and we will not be entitled to certain other rights, including the right to appoint any directors to the juul board of directors. accordingly, failure to obtain antitrust clearance would adversely affect us, including because it would substantially limit our rights with respect to our investment in juul and would prevent us from accounting for our investment in juul using the equity method.
in addition, regardless of whether antitrust clearance is obtained, the expected benefits of the juul transaction, such as any equity earnings and receipt of cash dividends, may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all, including due to the risks encountered by juul in its business, such as operational risks and regulatory risks at the international, federal and state levels, including actions by the fda; unanticipated impacts on juul's relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties; potential disruptions to juul's management or current or future plans and operations due to the juul transaction; or domestic or international litigation developments, investigations, or otherwise.  see item 7. tobacco space - business environment for a discussion of certain fda-related regulatory risks applicable to the e-vapor category. failure to realize the expected benefits of our juul investment could adversely affect the value of the investment. as discussed in the discussion and analysis - critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7, if a qualitative assessment of impairment of our juul investment were to indicate that its fair value is less than its carrying value, the investment would be written down to its fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on altria's consolidated financial position or earnings.
our investment in juul includes non-competition, standstill and transfer restrictions that prevent us from gaining control of juul. furthermore, if our percentage ownership in juul were to decrease below certain levels, we would lose certain of our governance, consent, preemptive and other rights with respect to our investment in juul and may be unable to account for the investment under the equity method.
the shares of juul we hold generally cannot be sold or otherwise transferred for a six-year period that expires on december 20, 2024, subject to limited exceptions. we have also generally agreed not to compete with juul in the e-vapor space for at least six years, which may be extended at our election. in addition, following receipt of antitrust clearance, our designees will comprise no more than one third of the members of the juul board of directors. as a result, juul's strategy and its material decisions are not controlled by us, and the terms of our agreements with juul mean that we are required to bear the risks associated with our investment in juul for at least a six-year period. further, in the event that our ownership percentage in juul were to decrease below certain levels due to transfers by us or otherwise, or if we elect not to extend our non-competition obligations beyond six years, we would lose some or all of our board designation rights, preemptive rights, consent rights and other rights with respect to our investment in juul. loss of these rights could adversely affect us by impairing our ability to influence juul and may prevent us from accounting for our investment under the equity method.
our proposed investment in cronos may not be completed within the anticipated timeframe or at all, and the expected benefits of the cronos transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all.
on december 7, 2018, we agreed to acquire common shares representing a 45% equity interest in cronos and a warrant to acquire common shares representing an additional 10% equity interest in cronos. the proposed transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval, which may take longer than expected. we cannot provide any assurance that the proposed transaction will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of the proposed transaction. there can also be no assurance that, if we complete the cronos transaction, we will be able to realize its expected benefits, including due to the risks encountered by cronos in its business, such as operational risks and legal and regulatory risks at the international, federal and state levels; unanticipated impacts on cronos's relationships with third parties, its management, or its current or future plans and operations due to the cronos transaction; or domestic or international litigation developments, investigations, or otherwise.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, and the discussion of cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a.
description of the company for a description of altria, see item 1. business, and background in note 1. background and basis of presentation to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 1").
altria's reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless products and wine. the financial services and the
13
innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of pmcc and the relative financial contribution of altria's innovative tobacco products businesses to altria's consolidated results.
as discussed in note 1, on january 1, 2018, altria adopted several accounting standard updates ("asu"). in connection with the adoption of two of these asus (asu no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash and asu no. 2017-07, compensation-retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost), altria restated certain prior year amounts.
executive summary consolidated results of operations the changes in altria's net earnings and diluted earnings per share ("eps") attributable to altria for the year ended december 31, 2018, from the year ended december 31, 2017, were due primarily to the following:

see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis.
▪   fewer shares outstanding: fewer shares outstanding during 2018 compared with 2017 were due primarily to shares repurchased by altria under its share repurchase programs.
▪   change in tax rate: the change in tax rate was driven primarily by the tax reform act, which reduced the u.s. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. for further discussion, see note 15.
▪   operations: the increase of $12 million in operations shown in the table above was due primarily to the following:
▪   higher earnings from altria's equity investment in ab inbev; and
▪   higher income from the smokeless products segment;
partially offset by:
▪   lower income from the smokeable products and wine segments; and
▪   higher investment spending in the innovative tobacco products businesses.
for further details, see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis.
2019 forecasted results in january 2019, altria forecasted that its 2019 full-year adjusted diluted eps growth rate is expected to be in the range of 4% to 7% over its 2018 full-year adjusted diluted eps base of $3.99. this forecasted growth rate excludes the 2019 forecasted expense items in the second table below. altria's 2019 guidance reflects its expectation for a higher full-year adjusted effective tax rate, primarily resulting from lower dividends from ab inbev; increased interest expense from the debt incurred from the cronos and juul transactions; savings from the cost reduction program announced in december 2018, which altria expects to build over the course of the year to an annualized level of approximately $575 million; and increased investments related to pm usa's lead market plans for launching iqos, once authorized by the fda. the guidance assumes little-to-no earnings or cash contributions from the cronos and juul investments. altria expects the adjusted diluted eps growth to come in the last three quarters of 2019, with a mid-single digit decline in the first quarter. in the first quarter of 2019, altria will have the increased interest expense without the full benefits of the cost reduction program and one fewer shipping day in the smokeable products segment. altria expects its 2019 full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of approximately 23.5% to 24.5%.

altria's full-year adjusted diluted eps guidance and full-year forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. these items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, loss/gain on ab inbev/sabmiller business combination, ab inbev special items, certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer ("npm") adjustment disputes under the 1998 master settlement agreement (such dispute resolutions are referred to as "npm adjustment items" and are more fully described in health care cost recovery litigation - npm adjustment disputes in note 19).
altria's management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on altria's reported diluted eps and reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, may be infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. as a result, altria does not provide a corresponding united states generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted eps guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast.
the factors described in item 1a represent continuing risks to this forecast.

altria reports its financial results in accordance with u.s. gaap. altria's management reviews certain financial results, including diluted eps, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items, including those items noted above. altria's management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria's underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. altria's management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis. altria's adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate. altria's management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria's chief operating decision maker (the "codm") for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. these adjusted financial measures are not consistent with u.s. gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
discussion and analysis critical accounting policies and estimates note 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria's consolidated financial statements. in most instances, altria must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under u.s. gaap.
the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in altria's consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between altria's estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of altria's consolidated financial statements:
▪consolidation: the consolidated financial statements include altria, as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. investments in which altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. equity investments in which altria does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for as an investment in an equity security. all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
15
▪revenue recognition: on january 1, 2018, altria adopted asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) and all related asu amendments.
altria's businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. while altria's businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type, all sales contracts are similarly structured. these contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer. all performance obligations are satisfied within one year; therefore, costs to obtain contracts are expensed as incurred and unsatisfied performance obligations are not disclosed. there is no financing component because altria expects, at contract inception, that the period between when altria transfers product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less.
altria's businesses define net revenues as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. altria's businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale (which do not include excise taxes on cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco or wine billed to customers).
altria's businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer. altria's businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer. altria's businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in altria's consolidated statements of earnings. altria's businesses record an allowance for returned goods, based principally on historical volume and return rates, which is included in other accrued liabilities on altria's consolidated balance sheets. altria's businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on altria's consolidated balance sheets.
payment terms vary depending on product type. altria's businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue, which is included in other accrued liabilities on altria's consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized. pm usa receives payment in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product. usstc receives substantially all payments within one business day of the customer obtaining control of the product. ste. michelle receives substantially all payments from customers within 45 days of the customer obtaining control of the product. amounts due from customers are included in receivables on altria's consolidated balance sheets.
for further discussion, see note 3. revenues from contracts with customers to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
▪depreciation, amortization, impairment testing and asset valuation: altria depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes its definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.
altria reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates. for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. if altria determines that an impairment exists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.
substantially all of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded by altria at december 31, 2018 relate to the 2017 acquisition of nat sherman, the 2009 acquisition of ust and the 2007 acquisition of middleton. altria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria to perform an interim review. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value. if the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values are determined using discounted cash flows.
goodwill by reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets at december 31, 2018 were as follows:
(in millions)           goodwill         indefinite-livedintangible assets cigarettes                   $22                                      $172

cigars                        77                                     2,640
wine                          74   233
total                     $5,196                                   $11,846
during 2018, altria recorded goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $111 million and $44 million, respectively, related to altria's decision in the fourth quarter of 2018 to refocus its innovative product efforts, which includes nu mark's discontinuation of production and distribution of all e-vapor products.
in addition, during 2018, altria completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
16
assets. upon completion of this testing, altria concluded, in the wine segment, that the columbia crest trademark of $54 million was fully impaired as columbia crest has been negatively impacted by an accelerated decline in the $7 to $10 premium wine segment, increased competition and reduction in trade support. the results of the 2018 quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for the other reporting units and trademarks are indicated below.
at december 31, 2018, the estimated fair values of the cigarettes and cigars reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets within those reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values.
at december 31, 2018, the estimated fair values of the smokeless products reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible assets within the reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying values, with the exception of the skoal trademark. at december 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the skoal trademark exceeded its carrying value of $3.9 billion by approximately 20%. skoal continues to be impacted by slowing category volumes and increased competitive activities due to higher pricing and adult tobacco consumer movement among tobacco products.
at december 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the wine reporting unit did not substantially exceed its carrying value. the estimated fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets within the wine reporting unit, with the exception of columbia crest (discussed above), substantially exceeded their carrying values. at december 31, 2018, the wine reporting unit exceeded its carrying value of $1.5 billion by approximately 14%. the wine reporting unit continues to be impacted by the slowing growth rate in the premium wine category and higher trade inventories.
during 2017 and 2016, altria's quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.
in 2018, altria used an income approach to estimate the fair values of all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows. the weighted-average discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 10%.
in performing the 2018 discounted cash flow analysis, altria made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, income, growth rates and discount rates. the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria's long-term financial forecast, which is used by altria's management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. the assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of altria's indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. the perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2%. fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria's control.
although altria's discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed, there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows. the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and, therefore, altria's impairment conclusions: general economic conditions; federal, state and local regulatory developments; category growth rates; consumer preferences; success of planned product expansions; competitive activity; and income and tobacco-related taxes. for further discussion of these factors, see operating results by business segment - tobacco space - business environment below.
while altria's management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are reasonable, actual performance in the short-term or long-term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.
for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see note 4. goodwill and other intangible assets, net to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
altria reviews its investment in ab inbev for impairment by comparing the fair value of its investment to its carrying value. if the carrying value of altria's investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired and impairment is recognized in the period identified. the factors used to make this determination include the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, ab inbev's financial condition and near-term prospects, and altria's intent and ability to hold its investment in ab inbev until recovery.
the fair value of altria's equity investment in ab inbev at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 was $13.1 billion and $22.1 billion, respectively, compared with its carrying value of $17.7 billion and $18.0 billion, respectively. at december 31, 2018, the fair value of altria's equity investment in ab inbev was less than its carrying value by approximately 26%. at february 22, 2019, the fair value of altria's equity investment in ab inbev was approximately $14.7 billion (approximately 17% below its carrying value). altria concluded that the decline in fair value of its investment in ab inbev below its carrying value is temporary and, therefore, no impairment was recorded. this conclusion is based on: (i) the fair value of altria's equity investment in ab inbev having historically exceeded its carrying value since october 2016, when altria obtained its ownership interest in ab inbev, (ii) the period of time that ab inbev shares have traded below altria's carrying value (began in september 2018) and the magnitude by which the carrying value of altria's investment in ab inbev exceeds its fair value, (iii) ab inbev's global platform (world's largest brewer by volume and one of the world's top five consumer products companies by revenue) with strong market positions in key markets, geographic diversification, experienced management team, financial condition, expected earnings and history of performance, and (iv) altria's ownership of restricted shares being subject to a five-year lock-up (subject to limited exceptions) ending october 10, 2021,
17
which altria believes provides sufficient time to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value of its investment in ab inbev.
if altria were to conclude that the decline in fair value is other than temporary, altria would determine and recognize, in the period identified, the impairment of its investment in ab inbev, which could result in a material adverse effect on altria's consolidated financial position or earnings. for additional information, see note 7.
altria reviews its investment in juul for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators. if a qualitative assessment indicates that altria's investment in juul is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is written down to its fair value. at december 31, 2018, there was no indication of impairment. for additional information, see note 8.
▪marketing costs: altria's businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. these consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. consumer engagement program payments are made to third parties. altria's businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in altria's consolidated statements of earnings. for interim reporting purposes, altria's businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.
▪contingencies: as discussed in note 19 and item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria and its subsidiaries, including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees. in 1998, pm usa and certain other u.s. tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 master settlement agreement (the "msa") with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. pm usa and certain other u.s. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi, florida, texas and minnesota (together with the msa, the "state settlement agreements"). pm usa's portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers' domestic cigarette shipments, including roll-your-own cigarettes, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due. in addition, pm usa, middleton, nat sherman and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca. payments under the state settlement agreements and the fda user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, operating income, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment. altria's subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales. altria's subsidiaries recorded approximately $4.5 billion, $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in connection with the state settlement agreements and fda user fees.
altria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. at the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed in note 19 and item 3: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.
▪employee benefit plans: as discussed in note 17. benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 17"), altria provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits. altria records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s. gaap, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. altria reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.
altria recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years.
at december 31, 2018, altria's discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations increased from 3.7% to 4.4% at december 31, 2018. altria presently anticipates a decrease of approximately $15 million in its 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense versus 2018, excluding amounts in each year related to termination, settlement and curtailment. this anticipated decrease is due primarily to lower amortization of unrecognized losses, partially offset by higher interest costs, each driven by the impact of higher discount rates. assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease in altria's discount rates would increase altria's pension and postretirement expense by approximately $46
18
million, and a 50 basis point increase in altria's discount rates would decrease altria's pension and postretirement expense by approximately $42 million. similarly, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) altria's pension and postretirement expense by approximately $38 million. see note 17 for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates.
▪income taxes: significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. altria records a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
altria recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings.
altria recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2018, 2017 and 2016 as a result of various tax events, including the impact of the tax reform act.
the main provisions of the tax reform act that impact altria include: (i) a reduction in the u.s. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, and (ii) changes in the treatment of foreign-source income, commonly referred to as a modified territorial tax system.
the transition to a modified territorial tax system required altria to record a deemed repatriation tax and an associated tax basis benefit in 2017. the tax impact related to the tax basis benefit and the deemed repatriation tax was based on provisional estimates as of january 18, 2018, substantially all of which were related to altria's share of ab inbev's accumulated earnings and associated taxes. altria recorded adjustments to the provisional estimates in 2018. the accounting for the repatriation tax is complete; therefore, no further adjustments to the provisional estimates are required.

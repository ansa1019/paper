item 1a. risk factors.
our business faces significant risks. these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks. these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report.
risks relating to our business we operate in the highly competitive health care industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.
each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment. in our soft contact lens business, coopervision faces intense competition from competitors' products, in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses, and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market. our largest competitors in the contact lens business, johnson & johnson vision care, inc. and alcon (owned by novartis ag) may have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development budgets, larger sales forces, greater market penetration and/or larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision. they offer competitive products and differentiated materials, plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses. the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products. our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully, on a timely basis in the americas, emea and asia pacific, and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products. any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend, in part, on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities. our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
to a lesser extent, coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery.
there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future, for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers, or that our competitors' newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervision's contact lens business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the contact lens industry also continues to evolve with respect to the introduction of new distribution and fulfillment models and service technologies which may conflict with coopervision's strategy or interfere with its customers' relationships and loyalty. for example, more contact lenses are being fulfilled directly to the consumer by manufacturers and wholesalers via online platforms, telemedicine is gaining popularity and more vision correction prescriptions are being provided through online refractive exams rather than in office by an eye care practitioner. coopervision's failure to adapt to the threats posed by
22
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries these new and emerging distribution models and internet driven services may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in the women's health care market, competitive factors include technological and scientific advances, product quality, price and effective communication of product information to physicians, hospitals, patients and ivf clinics. coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas, some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products, which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products.
acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks.
we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years. as part of our growth strategy, particularly at coopersurgical and at coopervision, we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses. future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization and/or impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. coopervision acquired paragon vision sciences and blueyes in fiscal 2018; procornea and grand vista llc in fiscal 2017. coopersurgical acquired paragard and lifeglobal in fiscal 2018; wallace in fiscal 2017. these acquisitions added operations to coopervision and coopersurgical, respectively, and expanded their international businesses. the acquisitions have, correspondingly, added risks we could face with respect to acquisitions and include:
•   failure to successfully obtain the anticipated revenues, margins and earnings benefits;
•   difficulties in, and expenses related to, the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired company and establishment of appropriate accounting controls and reporting procedures and other regulatory compliance procedures, including but not limited to third party compliance and due diligence;
•   increased leverage and the risk of lack of access to available financing, including financing for the acquisition or refinancing of debt owed by us on a timely basis and on reasonable terms;
•   risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;
•   potential loss of employees;
•   an inability to identify and consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;
•   diversion of management's attention away from other business concerns;
•   expenses of any undisclosed or potential liabilities, contingent liabilities or indemnification obligations of the acquired company;
•   expenses, including restructuring expenses, to shut-down our own locations or terminate our employees;
•   application of and compliance with new and unfamiliar regulatory frameworks such as pharmaceutical regulation applicable to our paragard iud;
•   failure to successfully obtain or maintain reimbursements under the third party payor plans, including but not limited to governmental programs, due to complex reporting and payment obligations;
•   a dilution of earnings per share; and
23
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries
•   risks inherent in accounting allocations and the risk that we are required to record significant adjustments to the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period.
product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate, and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products.
product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the health care industry in which coopersurgical competes. coopersurgical has historically purchased, leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others. over the past few years, coopersurgical has invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organizational growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy. coopervision, both internally and externally with third parties, invests in new product development, including the development of silicone hydrogel-based contact lenses. while much of coopervision's research and development activities are performed internally, it also uses external research and development investment in collaborations and joint development with third parties. research and development time commitments, higher feasibility risk with longer term projects, greater dependence on, and reduced control over, third party deliverables, the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial. there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and, as a result, justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval. in addition, our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies, such as contact lenses with anti-microbial or anti-allergenic features, or "smart" contact lenses which incorporate electronics that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products. competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses, such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia. failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
if our products are not accepted by the market, we will not be able to sustain or expand our business.
certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced, and we cannot assure that any of them, assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals, will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits. the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors, some of which are out of our control, including:
•   acceptance of our products by eye care and health care practitioners;
•   the cost competitiveness of our products;
•   consumer reluctance to try and use a new product;
•   regulatory and legislative requirements;
•   adequate coverage and reimbursement by third party payors;
•   the earlier release of competitive products, such as new silicone hydrogel products, into the market by our competitors; and
•   the emergence of newer and more competitive products.
24
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products.
technological developments in the eye care, family and women's health care, and diagnostics testing industries, such as new surgical procedures or medical devices, and genetic testing technology may limit demand for our products and services. corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products. if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction, the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease. we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses.
our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results.
a significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the united states, and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions. we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america, latin america and europe. over half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended october 31, 2018 and 2017, were derived from the sale of products outside the united states. we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future. international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks, including:
•   we may have difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;
•   we may have difficulty gaining market share in countries such as japan and china because of regulatory restrictions and customer preferences;
•   we may find it difficult to grow in emerging markets such as china, india, russia, brazil and other developing nations due to, among other things, customer acceptance, undeveloped and/or unfamiliar distribution channels, regulatory restrictions and changes, and business knowledge of these new markets;
•   tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the united states, and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions, including the tariffs recently enacted and proposed by the u.s. government on various imports from china and by the chinese government on certain u.s. goods, the scope and duration of which remain uncertain;
•   we may find it difficult to comply with a variety of united states and foreign legal, compliance and regulatory requirements such as the foreign corrupt practices act, the dodd-frank act, the u.k. bribery act and international data security and privacy laws;
•   we may find it difficult to manage a large organization spread throughout various countries;
•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results;
•   foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states;
•   failure to comply with united states department of commerce and other nations' import-export controls may result in fines and/or penalties;
•   general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy;
25
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries
•   foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including but not limited to increased enforcement of potentially conflicting and ambiguous anti-bribery laws;
•   we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; and
•   we may be subject to unforeseen economic or political events in certain countries that may have an impact on our customers' ability or preferences to buy our products.
as we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. however, any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our operating results.
current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business.
over the last few years in the united states and globally, market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth. foreign countries, in particular the euro zone, have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues. concerns about the euro zone's sovereign debt in recent years have caused uncertainty and disruption in the financial markets globally. while the global financial markets have showed general signs of improvement, uncertainty remains.
any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets, continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers. it may limit our ability, and the ability of our customers, to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal 2018. uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other business partners. if our customers' financial conditions are adversely affected, customers may reduce their purchases of our products or we may not be able to collect accounts receivable, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations or financial results.
coopervision and coopersurgical are encountering consolidation in their customer bases and emergence of more centralized large customer groups and retail chains. due to this trend, global and regional key account customers now represent a larger proportion or concentration of our business and any disruption to these relationships may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.
the results of the united kingdom's referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.
we are a multinational company headquartered in the united states with worldwide operations, with significant business operations in europe, including in the united kingdom. in june 2016, a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum. in march 2017, the government of the united kingdom formally gave notice of its intent to withdraw from
26
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries the european union. serving this notice began a two-year period for the united kingdom to negotiate terms for its withdrawal from the european union. at this time, it is not certain what steps, may be taken to facilitate the united kingdom's exit from the european union, which has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union.
this development has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will have and how such withdrawal could affect, or whether it could have a material adverse effect on, our business, financial condition and operating results.
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.
we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness.
our indebtedness could:
•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;
•   result in greater interest rate risk and volatility;
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and
•   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including our obligation to repay our credit facilities under certain circumstances, or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all.
our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, which could adversely affect our business, earnings and financial condition.
we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt.
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt. in order to maintain a desired mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variable-rate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements, without exchange of the underlying principal amounts. we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively and, which could adversely affect our business, earnings and financial condition.
27
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results.
as a result of our international operations, currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position. our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling, euro and japanese yen. we are also exposed to the danish krone, swedish krona, australian dollar and canadian dollar among other currencies. we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than u.s. dollars. to the extent we are unable to materially offset non-nonfunctional currency flows, exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. because our consolidated financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into u.s. dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a period-over-period comparative basis. although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our non-functional currency obligations or balances, these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely.
we face risks associated with disruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes, or idle or excess capacity could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position.
we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell. any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, integration difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disaster, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events), enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in non-compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cgmp) or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective. while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products, our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete. conversely, excess or idle capacity, which could result from acquisitions, inaccurate sales forecasting or unexpected manufacturing efficiencies, could significantly impact our profitability and near term financial condition.
coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses, which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues, primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom, puerto rico, hungary, costa rica and the united states. coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in connecticut, texas, new york, denmark, costa rica and united kingdom. in november 2017, coopersurgical purchased a manufacturing facility in costa rica to consolidate a portion of global manufacturing. we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets, and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site. before we can use a second manufacturing site, we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities, and because this process is expensive, we generally have not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site. if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility, it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product, which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales, profitability and market share.
28
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries coopervision distributes products out of the united states, the united kingdom, belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities. coopersurgical's products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in connecticut, denmark and the netherlands. coopersurgical is currently shifting its primary distribution facility from denmark to venlo, netherlands. any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, challenges related to system implementation, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disaster, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events) or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations, our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted, our products could be subject to recall, and sales and profitability could suffer.
our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal, state and foreign regulatory requirements, including the fda's cgmp for medical devices, known as the qsr regulations, which govern the procedures related to the design, testing, production processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage, importing, exporting and shipping of our products. we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices. in addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies, including the fda, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. failure to comply with qsr requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements or to respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to, among other things, warning letters, significant fines, injunctions, suspension of approvals, seizures, recalls or import holds of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. as a result, any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability.
we rely on independent suppliers in our supply chain for raw materials, packaging materials and components, mechanical equipment and some finished goods; we could experience inventory shortages if any of these suppliers encounter a manufacturing or distribution disruption our businesses utilize various chemicals, packaging materials, components, parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source. however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole or primary suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens, certain medical devices and ivf products. we also source mechanical equipment and in certain instances finished goods from oem suppliers. supply of these goods, items and materials is protected by contractual agreements, availability of alternative suppliers and/or safety stocks. however, if current suppliers fail to supply sufficient goods, items or materials to us on a timely basis, or at all for any reason, we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in our supply of products. for example, among other situations, some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products, including myday, biofinity, avaira and clariti, are supplied by a sole supplier, and the failure of a key or sole supplier to timely supply sufficient items and materials necessary for the manufacture of our silicone hydrogel contact lenses could in turn disrupt our supply of those lenses to the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, our business could suffer.
we consider our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks and licensing agreements, to be an integral component of our business. we attempt to protect our intellectual property
29
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation. our claims, even if meritorious, may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights. in addition, litigation can:
•   be expensive and time consuming to prosecute or defend;
•   result in a finding that we do not have certain intellectual property rights or that such rights lack sufficient scope or strength;
•   divert management's attention and resources; or
•   require us to license our intellectual property.
we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products. we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved. patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time, which may last until patents are issued, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months, we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions. the patents we own could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents.
both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on proprietary technology which is unpatented. it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements, which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. however, we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable.
we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products. to maintain the value of our trademarks, we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks. we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications, and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties. enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages, including the inability to continue using certain trademarks.
the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states. adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and
30
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries selling competing products, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others.
our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries, some of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, as well as other third parties, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products. in the contact lens industry, coopervision, its competitors and other third parties hold patents covering contact lens designs, business methods, processes and materials. claims that our products, business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology.
significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries. for example, coopervision in the past faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products. third parties have made, and may make in the future, claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology. any claims, even those without merit, could:
•   be expensive and time consuming to defend;
•   cause us to cease making, licensing or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;
•   require us to redesign or re-engineer our products, if feasible;
•   divert management's attention and resources; or
•   require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a necessary product, component or process.
we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation. any royalty or licensing agreement, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of some of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology, in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market, could adversely affect our business.
we could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings, including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products.
we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury. we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers, distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand. additionally, we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims, including negligence, relating to our provision of certain service offerings, including our genetic testing services and their accuracy. consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is the
31
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries subject of a claim or recall, or has been counterfeited. we handle some risk with third-party carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations. there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls, legal claims relating to our service offerings, or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products, in the future.
we face risks related to environmental matters.
our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and requirements, including those governing discharges to the air and water, the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health. we have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements. future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or the enforcement thereof, or the discovery of contamination at our facilities, may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. such laws and requirements are constantly changing, are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations. as a manufacturer of various products, we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims.
increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results.
determination of the company's effective tax rate and evaluation of its tax positions is uncertain with rapidly changing enactment, interpretation and enforcement of tax regulations by taxing authorities globally. when tax matters arise, several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate, which would have an adverse effect on the company's operating results. any resolution of a tax matter may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws. we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
the united kingdom enacted a new diverted profits tax (dpt) as of april 1, 2015 on profits of multinationals that they deemed artificially diverted from the united kingdom. the tax rate is 25%. dpt is intended to apply in two situations; (a) where a foreign company has artificially avoided having a taxable presence in the united kingdom and (b) where a group adopts a structure which lacks economic substance in order to divert profits from the united kingdom.
the united kingdom tax authorities (u.k. tax authorities) have begun an inquiry regarding the application of dpt to us for fiscal year 2015. we believe that the transactions in question were at arm's length with no intention to divert profit from the united kingdom and therefore are outside the intended reach of the dpt.
on december 20, 2017, the u.k. tax authorities issued a dpt charging notice of approximately gbp 31 million with respect to the transfer out of the united kingdom of certain intellectual property rights in
32
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries connection with the 2014 acquisition of sauflon pharmaceutical ltd. although the taxes were paid on the transfer, the u.k. tax authorities are challenging the value assigned to such property. we have contested the charging notice. the process for resolving such a notice can be lengthy and could involve litigation. the dpt legislation provides a one-year review period; however, it requires prepayment of the charging notice to be made within 30 days of its issuance. as required, the payment of gbp 31.0 million was made on january 19, 2018.
the company believes final resolution of the transfer value of intellectual property with the u.k. tax authorities is imminent. the outcome of final resolution is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states. our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions.
we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles, and changes in u.s. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. for example, the 2017 u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (2017 act) significantly changed income tax laws that affect u.s. corporations. we made significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of this new law and in our calculations of the provisional amounts reflected in our financial statements. consistent with sec guidance, the company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the 2017 act and recorded provisional income tax expense of $214.6 million in the financial statements for fiscal 2018. the u.s. treasury department, the internal revenue service (irs), and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the 2017 act will be applied or otherwise administered, and additional accounting guidance or interpretations may be issued in the future that is different from our current interpretation. as we further analyze the new law and collect relevant information to complete our computations of the related accounting impact, we may adjust the provisional amounts that could materially affect our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. in addition, other countries are considering fundamental tax law changes. any changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also impact our tax liabilities.
we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period.
33
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs.
we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states. this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns, discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan. a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.
we manage our businesses utilizing complex integrated software and hardware information technology operating systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded; an interruption or disruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to incur excessive costs.
we utilize complex integrated software and hardware operating systems, including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems, to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth. regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected. we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan, test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements, and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation. however, we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed. we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance, support and/or upgrade of these systems.
we are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (erp) system at coopervision. implementing a new erp system is not only costly but complex and difficult. implementing a new erp system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery. there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our new erp system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts.
cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication; a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems or cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business, force us to incur excessive costs or cause reputational harm.
the size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches. any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. we maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.
34
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business could suffer.
if we fail to recruit, develop and retain the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to obtain new customers, develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer. the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel. our success also depends on our ability to recruit, develop and retain and motivate highly skilled sales, marketing, engineering and scientific personnel. competition for these persons in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel.
provisions of our governing documents and delaware law, may have anti-takeover effects.
certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors. these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations. we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which could have anti-takeover effects.
risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products and services our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business.
our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda, and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. in the united states, the fda regulates virtually all aspects of medical device and pharmaceutical design, development, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling (including, for example, unique device identifier regulations), storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, promotion, advertising and distribution, as well as product import and export. our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions, including injunctions, fines, warning letters, suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution or product seizures. in the most egregious cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible.
our medical devices and pharmaceutical products require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions. medical devices and drug products may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. the process of obtaining, renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the fda, can be costly and time consuming. there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur, which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. in addition, the fda and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products, increase the cost of compliance, impose additional regulatory requirements on us, or otherwise impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products.
modifications and enhancements to medical devices and drug products also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change
35
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries in its intended use, design or manufacture. the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the fda may review any manufacturer's decision. we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application, but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions. if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position. we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications, if required.
any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our product candidates. if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results may be adversely affected.
the fda's and other regulatory authorities' policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. for example, in december 2016, the 21st century cures act (cures act), was signed into law. the cures act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and medical devices and spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is unclear. if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. we also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the united states, such as new policies introduced by the trump administration, or abroad.
increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals and potential decreased demand for our genetic testing services.
we offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth. regulatory and legislative proposals addressing oversight of genetic testing have been introduced in the united states, and we expect that new proposals will be introduced from time to time both in the united states and in foreign countries in the future. although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including ivds, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to ldt. we believe our tests fall within the definition of an ldt. as a result, we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda's enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions. however, our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda. legislative proposals addressing the fda's oversight of ldts have been introduced by congress in the past and new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future. the likelihood that congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the fda's ability to enforce its medical device regulations with respect to certain ldts is difficult to predict at this time. if the fda ultimately begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to ldts, our genetic tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the fda, the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the fda or instruction by congress. if the fda imposes
36
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries significant changes to the regulation of ldts it could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.
any new fda enforcement policies affecting ldts or new legislation, regulations or guidance may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our products and to develop and introduce new products in the future, which could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.
if we fail to comply with applicable federal, state, local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.
we are subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 (clia), a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. our clinical laboratory must be certified under clia in order for us to perform testing on human specimens. in addition, our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under clia so that we can offer them in our laboratory. clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. the law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state. our laboratories are located in the united states, and internationally in canada and the united kingdom, and we must maintain the requisite licenses in each jurisdiction.
development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to receive, or delay in receiving, foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business.
in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets (for example, the french sunshine act of 2013), duties and tax requirements. many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda.
in many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility. to date, we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations. however, our failure to receive, or delays in the receipt of, relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls, even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval, which could harm our reputation, business and financial results.
after a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including the fda's qsr regulations, which require manufacturers to follow, among other things, design, testing, production, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or "off-label" uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious
37
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries injury if the malfunction were to recur. the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. medical device manufacturers, such as coopervision and coopersurgical, may, under their own initiative, recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found, or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons. the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products. in addition, the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results.
changes in legislation and government regulation of the health care industry both in the united states and internationally, as well as third-party payors' efforts to control the costs of health care could materially adversely affect our business.
the aca made extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states. among the provisions of the aca, of greatest importance to the medical device industry and pharmaceutical industry are the following:
•   establishment of the patient-centered outcomes research institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
•   reporting and disclosure requirements on medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers for certain payments or other "transfers of value" made to physicians and physicians family members, certain healthcare facilities, and any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and physician family members, and any payments or other "transfers of value" to such owners. manufacturers are required to submit reports to the centers for medicare &amp; medicaid services (cms) by the 90th day of each calendar year;
•   absent new legislation, a 2.3 percent excise tax, currently suspended, will be reinstated as of january 1, 2020, on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the united states, with limited exceptions, which exceptions include all contact lenses;
•   payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models;
•   creation of the independent payment advisory board which has authority to recommend certain changes to reduce medicare spending and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if congress doesn't act on the recommendations;
•   establishment of a center for medicare innovation at cms to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower medicare and medicaid spending; and
•   an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the medicaid drug rebate program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively.
these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our fertility, office and surgical products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts. there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca, and we expect there will be additional
38
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries challenges and amendments to the aca in the future. additionally, recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries. major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations.
other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted. the budget control act of 2011, among other things, created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress. the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reductions to several government programs. these reductions include aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on april 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect until 2025 unless additional action is taken by congress. the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, among other things, further reduced medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. in addition, the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015, among other things, repealed the formula by which medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians' participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations.
we expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products, or result in additional pricing pressures. also, any adoption of health care reform proposals on a state-by-state basis could require us to develop state-specific marketing and sales approaches. we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business.
in addition, third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside the united states or abroad, increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care. these cost-control methods include prospective payment systems, capitated rates, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, requiring pre-authorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering health care. although cost controls or other requirements imposed by third-party payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices, this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may enroll as in-network providers and suppliers with certain payors. although, becoming an in-network provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates, it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels. thus, these payor relationships, or any similar relationships we may establish in the future, may not result in acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base. we cannot predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests. if we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests, our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer.
on april 5, 2017, the european parliament passed the medical devices regulation, which repeals and replaces the eu medical devices directive. unlike directives, which must be implemented into the
39
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries national laws of the european economic area (eea) member states, the regulations would be directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of eea member state laws implementing them) in all eea member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among eea member states. the medical devices regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eea for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
the medical devices regulation will, however, only become applicable in 2020 and the in-vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation will become applicable in 2022. once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:
•   strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
•   establish explicit provisions on manufacturers' responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
•   improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
•   set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the eu; and
•   strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
these modifications may have an impact on the way we conduct our business in the eea and an adverse impact on our overall business operations and financial results.
the costs of complying with the requirements of federal and state laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
state and federal laws and regulations, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa) govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability and integrity of individually identifiable information, including protected health information (phi). hipaa establishes basic national privacy and security standards for protection of phi by covered entities such as our genetics testing subsidiaries and the business associates with whom such entities contract for services, including another one of our subsidiaries, eye care prime llc, which offers value-added software solutions for eye care professionals. hipaa requires both covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures for phi that is used or disclosed, and to adopt administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect phi. when we are acting as a business associate, our clients that are covered entities are mandated by hipaa to enter into written agreements with us - known as business associate agreements - that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa. our genetics testing subsidiaries are likewise required to enter into business associate agreements with any of their business associates.
40
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries mandatory penalties for hipaa violations can be significant. a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. if a person knowingly or intentionally obtains or discloses phi in violation of hipaa requirements, criminal penalties may also be imposed.
we maintain safeguards that we believe are reasonable and appropriate to protect the privacy and security of phi and other personally identifiable information consistent with applicable law and our contractual obligations; however, our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, viruses, hackers, and other potential sources of security breaches. in addition, we may not be able to prevent incidences of inappropriate use or unauthorized access to phi by our employees or contractors. any such breaches could result in exposure to liability under federal and state laws and/or under our contractual arrangements and could adversely impact our business.
we are also subject to laws and regulations in countries other than united states covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. eu member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. for example, the eu data protection directive, as implemented into national laws by the eu member states, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the processing of personal data. the new eu-wide general data protection regulation (gdpr) entered into force in may 2016 and became applicable on may 25, 2018, replacing the current data protection laws of each eu member state. the gdpr implemented more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities.
any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by european data protection authorities, fines and penalties (for example, of up to 20,000,000 euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) under the gdpr and eprivacy regulation), litigation and/or adverse publicity, including by consumer advocacy groups, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and/or could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business.
laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may be subject to various federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, physician self-referral laws and false claims laws. violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including medicare, medicaid, veterans administration health programs and tricare. similarly, if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws, because of the complex
41
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries and far-reaching nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws.
massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to health care practitioners that sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals, sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to health care practitioners located within the state. additionally, the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs. other states (e.g., california, vermont and nevada) have adopted similar laws. these laws and regulations act to limit our marketing practices, require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance, and expose us to additional liabilities.
in addition, the aca, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and certain criminal health care fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. the aca also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute. in addition, federal government price reporting laws, changed by the aca to, among other things, increase the minimum medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program and offer such rebates to additional populations, that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on our marketed drugs. participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products, increased infrastructure costs and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts.
any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, changes in these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
ethical, legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests.
genetic testing has raised ethical, legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. government authorities could, for social or other purposes, limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. similarly, these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use, or physicians to be reluctant to order, genetic tests even if permissible. these and other ethical, legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance and adoption of our tests or reduce the potential markets for our tests, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
note numbers refer to "notes to consolidated financial statements" in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
results of operations in this section, we discuss the results of our operations for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under "capital resources and liquidity." within the tables presented, percentages are calculated based on the underlying whole-dollar amounts and, therefore, may not recalculate exactly from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes.
outlook overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and general health care markets. however, events affecting the economy as a whole, including but not limited to the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by foreign currency volatility, global tax reform, debt concerns, the uncertainty caused by the united kingdom's upcoming withdrawal from the european union, and the trend of consolidations within the health care industry, impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our future performance.
coopervision - we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using silicone hydrogel aquaform® technology and phosphorylcholine technology (pc) technologytm. we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as single-use and monthly wearing options. coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration using recently introduced products, and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets, including through acquisitions.
coopervision acquired the following entities during fiscal 2018:
•   blueyes on january 4, 2018 - a long-standing distribution partner, which has a leading position in the distribution of contact lenses to the optical and pharmacy sector in israel
•   paragon vision sciences on december 1, 2017 - a leading provider of ortho-k specialty contact lenses and oxygen permeable rigid contact lens materials coopervision acquired the following entities in fiscal 2017:
•   procornea on august 3, 2017 - a netherlands based manufacturer of specialty contact lenses, which expanded coopervision's access to myopia (nearsightedness) management markets with new products
•   grand vista llc on june 30, 2017 - a distributor in russia of soft contact lenses our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our desired future levels of sales growth and profitability. coopervision manufactures and markets a wide variety of silicone hydrogel contact lenses within the daily, two-week and monthly modalities along with manufacturing some of these lenses as toric and/or multifocal lenses, including but not limited to biofinity®, myday®, avaira vitality® and clariti®. single-use lenses are designed for daily replacement and frequently replaced lenses are designed for two-week or monthly replacement. we expect increasing demand for clariti® 1day and myday® products, as well as future single-use products.
50
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations coopersurgical - our coopersurgical business competes in the general health care market with a focus on advancing the health of women, babies and families through a diversified portfolio of products and services focusing on women's health, fertility, diagnostics and contraception. coopersurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies, products and services that complement its business model.
coopersurgical acquired the following entities and assets during fiscal 2018:
•   lifeglobal group on april 3, 2018 - a privately held company that specializes primarily in ivf media. lifeglobal's product categories include media products, ivf laboratory air filtration products and dishware. this acquisition fits coopersurgical product portfolio and strengthens our fertility media offerings
•   paragard on november 1, 2017 - coopersurgical acquired the assets of the paragard iud business from teva for $1.1 billion. paragard broadens and strengthens coopersurgical's current women's health product portfolio and it is the only non-hormonal, long lasting, reversible contraceptive option approved by the fda and available in the united states. iuds represent a large and growing segment of the contraceptive market and this acquisition allows coopersurgical to accelerate growth providing opportunities for operational synergies.
in fiscal 2017, coopersurgical acquired wallace within fertility, the ivf segment of smiths medical international ltd. wallace manufactures a range of ivf and ob/gyn products.
we intend to continue investing in coopersurgical's business with the goal of expanding our integrated solutions model within the areas of women's health, fertility, diagnostics and contraception.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, coopersurgical recognized an impairment charge of $24.4 million on the intangible assets acquired from recombine inc. (recombine) as the cash flows expected to be generated by this asset group over its estimated remaining life were not sufficient to recover its carrying value. coopersurgical acquired recombine in fiscal 2016, a clinical genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening. in connection with the impairment charge, on june 1, 2018, coopersurgical announced the exit of the carrier screening and non-invasive prenatal testing (nipt) product lines in fertility. exit and restructuring charges which were substantially completed at the end of fiscal 2018, consisted primarily of compensation and benefits to terminated employees, were approximately $10.0 million. the net loss from both product lines are not material to the company's consolidated results of operations.

(the 2016 credit agreement). this agreement, maturing on march 1, 2021, provides for a multi-currency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion (the 2016 revolving credit facility) and a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $830.0 million (the 2016 term loan facility). we paid down $705.0 million of the 2016 term loan facility in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 and had $125.0 million outstanding at october 31, 2018. see note 4. debt of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the company believes that current cash, cash equivalents and future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet the company's anticipated cash needs, including working capital needs, capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements included in this annual report. to the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our liquidity needs such as that for acquisitions, share repurchases, cash dividends or other activities as we execute our business strategy, we anticipate that additional funds will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.

coopervision fiscal 2017 net sales growth was partially offset by foreign exchange rate fluctuations which had a negative impact on net sales of $19.8 million. americas net sales growth was primarily due to market gains of silicone hydrogel contact lenses including biofinity, clariti and myday, partially offset by a decrease in sales of older hydrogel lens products. emea net sales growth was largely due to market gains of silicone hydrogel contact lenses including biofinity, clariti and myday, offset by a decrease in sales of older hydrogel products and weakening foreign currencies, primarily the british pound, compared to the prior year against the united states dollar for the first three fiscal quarters and euro, for the first half of the fiscal year. net sales in the asia pacific region grew on market gains of silicone hydrogel and hydrogel lenses, including biofinity, clariti and myday, partially offset by weakening foreign currencies, primarily the japanese yen, for the second half of the fiscal year.
coopervision's net sales growth was driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold, including recently introduced silicone hydrogel products. while unit growth and product mix have influenced coopervision's net sales, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth.

coopersurgical's net sales increase in fertility products compared to the prior year period was mainly due to incremental sales from products and services of acquired companies. the net sales of medical office and surgical procedures remained relatively flat in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year due to declines in sales of disposable products, partially offset by growth in recently launched products used in surgical procedures. unit growth and product mix, primarily sales of recently acquired products and services, influenced sales growth. net sales growth was partially offset by the negative impact from the weakening of foreign currencies compared to the united states dollar during the year.

•   the favorable currency impact to coopervision's cost of sales primarily led by the weakening of the british pound compared to the united states dollar; and
•   was offset by $10.9 million of primarily incremental costs associated with the impact of hurricane maria on our puerto rico manufacturing facility, $5.7 million of product write off costs related to the product transition from avaira sphere to avaira vitality, and $0.6 million of facility start up in fiscal 2017. fiscal 2016 gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher restructuring and integrations costs.
coopersurgical's gross margin in fiscal 2018 was positively impacted by the inclusion of our paragard iud product with higher gross margin; however, it was offset by:
•   $49.3 million of inventory step-up relating to the paragard and lifeglobal acquisitions; and
•   $16.2 million of primarily integration and acquisition costs.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations coopersurgical's decrease in gross margin in fiscal 2017, compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a change in product mix arising from sales of acquired lower margin fertility products and services. cost of sales included $5.8 million of integration costs compared to $4.4 million in fiscal 2016.

coopervision's sequential increase in sga in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017 and 2016 was due to investments to support our long-term objectives, including increased headcount, investments in information technology and higher distribution expenses to support revenue growth. coopervision's sga in fiscal 2018 included $8.7 million of integration and third-party consulting costs.
coopervision's sga in fiscal 2017 included $9.1 million of legal costs related to unilateral pricing policy (upp) and $4.7 million of acquisition and integration costs, compared to $2.9 million of upp costs and $9.0 million of restructuring and integration costs in fiscal 2016.
the increases in coopersurgical's sga in the fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales were primarily due to the addition of paragard marketing expenses and sales headcount investment to support growth. coopersurgical's sga in fiscal 2018, included approximately $10.0 million of carrier screening and nipt exit costs and $24.0 million primarily related to acquisition and integration expenses of acquired companies.
the increase in coopersurgical's sga in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 in absolute dollars was primarily due to the inclusion of operating expenses of acquired companies and investment in headcount to support growth. coopersurgical's sga included $16.3 million primarily related to acquisition and integration expenses of acquired companies compared to $11.3 million in fiscal 2016.
the increases in corporate sga in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 were primarily due to $6.2 million of compensation costs related to executives' retirements. the increase in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to share based compensation related expenses.

the increases in amortization expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in recent acquisitions in coopervision and coopersurgical, primarily paragard which increased amortization expense by $70.8 million.
impairment of intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, coopersurgical recognized an impairment charge of $24.4 million on the intangible assets acquired from recombine inc. as the cash flows expected to be generated by this asset group over its estimated remaining life were not sufficient to recover its carrying value. coopersurgical acquired recombine inc., a clinical genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening, in fiscal 2016. in connection with the impairment charge, on june 1, 2018, coopersurgical announced the exit of the carrier screening and nipt product lines in fertility. exit and restructuring charges which were substantially completed at the end of fiscal 2018, consisted primarily of compensation and benefits to terminated employees, were approximately $10.0 million. the net loss from both product lines are not material to the company's consolidated results of operations.

the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales reflects higher average debt balances mainly due to the $1.425 billion term loan entered into on november 1, 2017 to primarily fund the paragard acquisition and higher interest rates. fiscal 2018 interest expense also included $2.5 million write off of debt issuance costs related to partial prepayments of the 2016 term loan and $1.7 million of bridge loan facility fees that were incurred related to the paragard acquisition.
the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales reflect higher average debt balances as a result of debt incurred in connection with acquisitions as well as higher interest rates. fiscal 2017 interest expense also included $2.2 million of bridge loan facility fees that were incurred related to the paragard acquisition.

foreign exchange loss primarily resulted from the revaluation and settlement of foreign currencies-denominated balances. other income in fiscal 2018 is primarily from the realization of a puerto rico research and development credit of $14.2 million as we had the intent and ability to sell the credit.
other expense in fiscal 2017 includes a $0.2 million foreign exchange loss on forward contracts related to an acquisition. other expense in fiscal 2016 includes a $0.6 million foreign exchange loss on forward contracts related to an acquisition and a $0.4 million loss related to extinguishment of debt.
provision for income taxes the company's effective tax rate (etr) was 57.9%, 5.3% and 7.0% for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the etr in fiscal 2018 increased in comparison to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the 2017 act which was partially offset by a shift in the geographic mix of income. the etr in fiscal 2017 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2016 due to the shift in the geographic mix of income as well as excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.
the etr for 2018 was greater than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax expense related to the enactment of the 2017 act. the etr for 2017 and 2016 was less than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate because a majority of our taxable income was earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income significantly impacted our overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we operate are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states. the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the u.s. federal statutory tax rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the fiscal years presented include the united kingdom, barbados and puerto rico. see note 5. income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

share-based compensation plans we grant various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares and restricted stock units. the share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2018 was $43.2 million and $8.8 million, respectively, compared to $37.2 million and $11.4 million, respectively, in fiscal 2017. as of october 31, 2018, there was $79.2 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to non-vested awards. see note 8. stock plans of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black-scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value. the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2018 would have increased by approximately $5.69. to determine the stock price volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the company's stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2018 would have increased by approximately $1.91.

working capital the decrease in working capital at the end of fiscal 2018 from the end of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in accrued and other current liabilities ($122.4 million) mainly due to an increase in charge backs, an increase in short term notes payable ($13.7 million), an increase in accounts payable ($4.3 million) and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents ($11.1 million). this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable ($58.1 million) from increased revenue, an increase in prepayments and other current assets ($76.0 million) primarily from the $42.0 million (gbp 31 million) payment to u.k. tax authorities relating to dpt, and an increase in inventories ($14.7 million).
at october 31, 2018, our inventory months on hand were 6.3 compared to 6.5 at october 31, 2017. the $14.7 million increase in inventories was primarily due to increase in finished goods and raw materials to support product launches and production levels. our days sales outstanding (dso) remained flat at 53 days at october 31, 2018 and at october 31, 2017.
we have reviewed our needs in the united states and have determined there is sufficient cash to fund working capital without repatriating cash from our foreign subsidiaries. for purposes of recording the provisional tax expense for the year ended october 31, 2018, we are no longer asserting that earnings from our foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. however, the company has not completed its analysis and will make a final decision within the measurement period. if the company changes its assertion to not indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings, there will be more flexibility in using the cash from our foreign operations to fund future working capital in the united states.

operating cash flow cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 is one of our major sources of liquidity, at $668.9 million compared to $593.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $509.6 million in fiscal 2016. cash provided by operating activities increased by $75.3 million in fiscal 2018. this increase in cash flow provided by operating activities primarily consists of an increase of $182.5 million in non-cash items, from $226.9 million in the fiscal 2017 to $409.4 million in fiscal 2018, and increase in assets and liabilities of $125.8 million. this increase was offset by a decrease in net income of $233.0 million from $372.9 million in fiscal 2017 to $139.9 million in fiscal 2018, primarily due to $214.6 million of provisional tax expense related to the 2017 act.
the $182.5 million increase from non-cash items compared to fiscal 2017 is primarily due to a $86.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a $50.5 million release of a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired mainly from paragard, impairment of intangibles of $24.4 million and an increase in share-based compensation expense of $6.0 million.
the $125.8 million increase in the net cash from changes in assets and liabilities compared to fiscal 2017 is mainly due to an increase in long-term liabilities of $150.7 million, primarily from a provisional tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation of deferred foreign earnings under the 2017 act of $141.5 million, a $25.9 million increase in the net changes of inventories, driven by acquisitions and higher raw materials to support production levels, and a $62.3 million increase in accrued liabilities mainly due to increase in charge backs. this increase is partially offset by a $34.4 million decrease in net changes in receivables, a $51.1 million decrease in changes to prepayments and other assets primarily due to a $42.0 million payment to the u.k. tax authorities, a $22.1 million decrease in net changes to accounts payable and a $5.5 million decrease in accrued income taxes.
cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was at $593.6 million compared to $509.6 million in fiscal 2016. fiscal 2017 results include $372.9 million of net income and non-cash items primarily made up of $188.4 million related to depreciation and amortization, $37.2 million of share-based compensation and $6.1 million of loss on disposal of property, partially offset by $7.1 million related to deferred income taxes. cash flow from operating capital reflect the changes in operating assets and liabilities, which are primarily a $25.1 million increase in accounts receivable, driven by higher revenue, an increase in inventories of $30.9 million, driven by higher raw materials to support production levels and inventories from acquisitions, and other assets of $13.8 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable of $25.0 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $18.9 million, and an increase in other long term liabilities of $9.8 million. the $84.0 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 is primarily due to the increase in net income and inclusion of excess tax benefit from share based compensation awards in operating activities from the adoption of asu2016-09.
investing cash flow cash used in investing activities increased by $1,136.2 million to $1,517.5 million in fiscal 2018. the increase was driven by a $66.4 million increase in capital expenditures, primarily to invest in the

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations expansion of distribution and manufacturing capacity, and an increase in payments for business and asset acquisitions of $1,069.8 million. the increase in payments related to acquisitions was largely due to the acquisition of paragard as discussed in outlook above and in note 2. acquisitions of the consolidated financial statements.
cash used in investing activities of $381.3 million in fiscal 2017 was for capital expenditures of $127.2 million primarily to increase manufacturing capacity and payments of $254.1 million primarily related to acquisitions in fiscal 2017. in fiscal 2017, payments related to the acquisitions are procornea holding b.v, wallace and grand vista llc.
financing cash flow cash provided by financing activities increased by $1,072.3 million to $844.4 million in fiscal 2018. the increase was driven by a $1,012.1 million increase of net proceeds from short and long-term debt primarily due to additional debt taken on to fund the paragard acquisition, and $7.1 million increase in net proceeds related to share-based compensation awards. no share repurchases were made in fiscal 2018 compared to $55.0 million in fiscal 2017.
cash used in financing activities of $227.9 million in fiscal 2017 was driven by $211.7 million net repayments of short term debt, $55.0 million for repurchase of common stock, $5.3 million net payments related to share-based compensation awards, $4.3 million of payments of contingent consideration for prior acquisitions and $2.9 million for dividends, partially offset by $49.2 million net proceeds from long term debt.
the 2017 term loan agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, as well as financial covenants that require the company to maintain a certain total leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio (each as defined in the 2017 term loan agreement) consistent with the 2016 credit agreement. as defined, in both the 2017 term loan agreement and the 2016 credit agreement, we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3.00 to 1.00, and a total leverage ratio of no higher than 3.75 to 1.00. at october 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the interest coverage ratio at 10.66 to 1.00 and the total leverage ratio at 2.21 to 1.00.
at october 31, 2018, we had $1.425 billion outstanding under the 2017 term loan agreement, $125.0 million outstanding under the 2016 term loan facility and $560.5 million available under the 2016 revolving credit facility.
at october 31, 2018, we had $77.7 million in cash & cash equivalents, predominantly outside the united states.
on november 1, 2018, subsequent to the fiscal year ended october 31, 2018, the company entered into a 364-day, $400.0 million, senior unsecured term loan agreement by and among the company, the lenders party thereto and pnc bank, national association, as administrative agent which matures on october 31, 2019 (the 2018 term loan agreement). the company used the funds to partially repay outstanding borrowings under the 2016 revolving credit facility. see note 14. subsequent event of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
share repurchases in december 2011, our board of directors authorized the 2012 share repurchase program and through subsequent amendments, the most recent in march 2017, the total repurchase authorization was increased from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion of the company's common stock. the program has no expiration date

(1) as of october 31, 2018, we had recorded $153.8 million of income tax liabilities related to the provisional one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the 2017 act, which will be payable in eight annual installments. the first installment is classified as a current income tax payable on our consolidated balance sheet. the remaining installment amounts will be equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal 2020 through 2023, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025, and 25% in fiscal year 2026.
the expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2028 are disclosed in note 9. employee benefits of the consolidated financial statements.
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, about $68.9 million of our long-term income taxes payable have been excluded from the table above. however, other long-term liabilities, included in our consolidated balance sheet, include these uncertain tax positions. see note 5. income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
inflation and changing prices inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years.

the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting pronouncements information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1. accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements.
estimates and critical accounting policies management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap). we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods.
•   revenue recognition - we recognize product net sales, net of discounts, returns and rebates in accordance with related accounting standards and sec staff accounting bulletins. as required by these standards, we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller's price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. for contact lenses as well coopersurgical's office and surgical products, fertility and diagnostic products and services, this occurs when title and risk of ownership transfers to our customers, and/or when services are rendered. we believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. we record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, chargebacks, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. we record taxes collected from customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in net sales.
•   valuation of goodwill - we evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist in accordance with related accounting standards. we performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2018, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. we performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2017 and concluded that we had no impairment of goodwill in that year.
goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. if our common stock price trades below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, we may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of our goodwill that could be material, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets, stockholders' equity and financial condition.
we test goodwill impairment in accordance with asu 2017-04, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. we perform a qualitative assessment to test each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit. based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its
68
the cooper companies, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations carrying amount, the fair value of a reporting unit will be compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge will be recognized for the carrying amount which exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. our reporting units are the same as our business segments - coopervision and coopersurgical - reflecting the way that we manage our business.
•   business combinations - we routinely consummate business combinations. results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. we recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. key assumptions routinely utilized in allocation of purchase price to intangible assets include projected financial information such as revenue projections for companies acquired. as of the acquisition date, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
•   income taxes - we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. to determine the tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material.
regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense.

item 7a.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk eastman has exposure to various market risks principally due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the pricing of various commodities, and interest rates. in an effort to manage these risks, the company employs various strategies, including pricing, inventory management, and hedging. the company enters into derivative contracts which are governed by policies, procedures, and internal processes set forth by its board of directors.
the company determines its exposures to market risk by utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates.
foreign currency risk due to a portion of the company's operating cash flows and borrowings being denominated in foreign currencies, the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business. the company manages most foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets. to mitigate foreign currency risk, from time to time, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period and denominated in foreign currencies, and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. additionally, the company, from time to time, enters into non-derivative and derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. the foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-
denominated borrowings. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency derivative and non-derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
at december 31, 2018 , the market risk associated with certain cash flows under these derivative transactions assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the u.s. dollar relative to these foreign currencies was $28 million, with an additional $3 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in those foreign currency rates. at december 31, 2017 , the market risk associated with cash flows under these derivative transactions assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the u.s. dollar relative to those currencies was $45 million, with an additional $5 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in those exchange rates.
since the company utilizes currency-sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value from those instruments is generally offset by an increase in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions.
in january 2018, eastman entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps and designated these swaps to hedge a portion of its net investment in a euro functional currency denominated subsidiary against foreign currency fluctuations. these contracts involve the exchange of fixed u.s. dollars with fixed euro interest payments periodically over the life of the contracts and an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. the fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps include €150 million ( $180 million ) maturing january 2021 and €266 million ( $320 million )
maturing august 2022.
in october 2018, eastman entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps and designated these swaps to hedge a portion of its net investment in a euro functional currency denominated subsidiary against foreign currency fluctuations. these contracts involve the exchange of fixed u.s. dollars with fixed euro interest payments periodically over the life of the contracts and an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. the fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps include €165 million ( $190 million ) maturing january 2024, €104 million ( $120 million )
maturing march 2025, and €165 million ( $190 million ) maturing february 2027.
63
at december 31, 2018 , a 10 percent fluctuation in the euro currency rate would have had a $240 million impact on the designated net investment values in the foreign subsidiaries. at december 31, 2017 , a 10 percent fluctuation in the euro currency rate would have had a $149 million impact on the designated net investment values in the foreign subsidiaries. as a result of the designation of the euro-denominated borrowings and designated cross-
currency interest rate swaps as hedges of the net investments, foreign currency translation gains and losses on the borrowings and designated cross-currency interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of the "change in cumulative translation adjustment" within "other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
therefore, a foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-denominated borrowings or the foreign currency change in the designated cross-currency interest rate swaps.
commodity risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its raw materials and energy, as well as contract sales of certain commodity products. to mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, ethylene, and benzene, as well as selling prices for ethylene, the company enters into derivative transactions, from time to time, to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period. at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 , the market risk associated with these derivative contracts, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent and no corresponding change in the selling price of finished goods, was $25 million and $30 million, respectively, with an additional $3 million of exposure at both dates for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter.
interest rate risk eastman is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long-term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. the nature and amount of the company's long-term and short-term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. the company manages global interest rate exposure as part of regular operational and financing strategies. the company had variable interest rate borrowings
(including credit facility borrowings and commercial paper borrowings) of $293 million and $589 million at december
31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. these borrowings represented approximately 5 percent and 10 percent of total outstanding debt and bore weighted average interest rates of 2.53 percent and 1.89 percent at december 31, 2018 and
2017 , respectively. a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change annualized interest expense by approximately $1 million as of both december 31, 2018 and 2017 .
eastman may enter into interest rate swaps, collars, or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to the company's borrowing costs. as of both december 31, 2018 and 2017 , the company had an interest rate swap outstanding with a notional value of $75 million. for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, the company uses a hypothetical 10
percent increase in interest rates. the corresponding market risk of the interest rate swap hedging the interest rate risk on the 3.8% bonds maturing march 2025 was $1 million as of both december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 .

definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
1.  significant accounting policies financial statement presentation the consolidated financial statements of eastman chemical company ("eastman" or the "company") and subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted ("gaap") in the united states and of necessity include some amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. future actual results could differ from such current estimates. the consolidated financial statements include assets, liabilities, sales revenue, and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained.
eastman accounts for other joint ventures and investments in minority-owned companies where it exercises significant influence on the equity basis. intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
certain prior period data has been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to conform to current period presentation. as of january 1, 2018:
eastman's primary measure of operating performance for all periods presented is earnings before interest and
•  taxes ("ebit") on a consolidated and segment basis. previously, the company's primary measure of operating performance was operating earnings.
as discussed below, the new accounting standard for the presentation of net periodic benefit costs requires the company to present non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs (interest cost, expected return on plan assets, curtailment gains or losses, amortization of prior service costs or credits, and mark-to-market gains or losses) separately from service cost. these non-service cost components were
•  reclassified from "cost of sales", "selling, general and administrative expenses", and "research and development expenses" line items and are now included in a new line item, "other components of post-employment (benefit) cost, net" on the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings for all periods presented. this reclassification does not change prior period ebit, earnings before income taxes, or net earnings and, accordingly, management does not consider this change to have a material impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
recently adopted accounting standards accounting standards update ("asu") 2014-09 revenue recognition (accounting standards codification ("asc") 606): on january 1, 2018, eastman adopted this standard under the modified retrospective method, such that revenue for all periods prior to january 1, 2018 continue to be reported under the previous standard, which resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $53 million after tax for products shipped but not delivered as of december 31, 2017.
under the new standard, the company recognizes revenue when performance obligations of the sale are satisfied. the majority of the company's terms of sale have a single performance obligation to transfer products. accordingly, the company recognizes revenue when control has been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products. under the previous revenue recognition accounting standard, the company recognized revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, generally upon the delivery of goods.
changes in the accounting required by this new standard did not materially impact the company's financial statements and related disclosures when comparing 2018 under the new revenue standard to previous years under the prior standard. for further information, see note 22, "revenue recognition" .
asu 2016-01 financial instruments: on january 1, 2018, eastman adopted this standard relating to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. this standard requires equity investments (except equity method and consolidated investments) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. management has concluded that changes in its accounting required by the new standard did not materially impact the company's financial statements and related disclosures. in february 2018, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu 2018-03 as an update to the standard described above which was adopted on july
1, 2018. management has concluded that changes in its accounting required by the update did not materially impact the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2016-16 income taxes - intra-entity transfers: on january 1, 2018, eastman adopted this standard under the modified retrospective method resulting in a beginning retained earnings decrease of $39 million . under this standard, the company is required to recognize the income tax consequence of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
72
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements asu 2017-05 other income - gains and losses from derecognition of nonfinancial assets: on january 1, 2018, eastman adopted this standard in conjunction with the revenue recognition standard mentioned above. this standard clarifies the scope of nonfinancial asset derecognition and the accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. this adoption had no impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures in the current period.
asu 2017-07 compensation - retirement benefits: on january 1, 2018, eastman adopted this standard retrospectively for income statement effects and prospectively for balance sheet effects. this standard is intended to improve the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs by requiring the reporting of the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. the other components of net periodic benefit costs (interest cost, expected return on plan assets, curtailment gains or losses, amortization of prior service costs or credits, and mark-to-
market gains or losses) are to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of income from operations, if presented. management has concluded that changes in its accounting required by this new standard did not materially impact the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2017-12 derivatives and hedging: on january 1, 2018, eastman adopted this standard on a modified retrospective basis for income statement impacts and prospectively for presentation and disclosure resulting in a beginning retained earnings increase of $2 million related to ineffectiveness recognized in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" ("aoci") which was recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position under the previous standard. this standard is intended to simplify the application of hedge accounting and improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in the financial statements. management has included the additional disclosures required by this standard in note 9, "derivative and non-derivative financial instruments" .
asu 2017-04 intangibles - goodwill and other: on october 1, 2018, eastman adopted this standard on a prospective basis beginning with the assessments performed in the fourth quarter 2018. fasb issued this standard as a part of its simplification initiative that bases the impairment of goodwill on any difference for which the carrying value is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit.
accounting standards issued but not adopted as of december 31, 2018
asu 2016-02 leases: in february 2016, the fasb issued this standard on lease accounting. the new standard establishes two types of leases for lessees: finance and operating. both finance and operating leases will have associated right-of-use assets and liabilities initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted. the new standard is to be applied under a modified retrospective approach wherein practical expedients have been allowed that will not require reassessment of current leases at the effective date. in july 2018, the fasb issued update asu 2018-11 that allows entities to initially apply the new leases standard prospectively at the adoption date with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption as necessary. the company will adopt this standard beginning first quarter 2019, and anticipates adopting under the optional prospective method which will have a material impact, on a gross basis, on the company's consolidated statements of financial position. in preparation for adoption, management continues lease accounting system testing and development of related internal controls and disclosures.
asu 2016-13 financial instruments - credit losses: in june 2016, the fasb issued this standard relating to credit losses. the amendments require a financial asset (including trade receivables) to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected through the use of allowances for credit losses valuation account. the income statement will reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, beginning after december
15, 2018. in november 2018, the fasb issued amendment 2018-19 to clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of this sub-topic but instead, impairment of such operating lease receivables should be accounted for in accordance with topic 842, leases (2016-02 above). the new standard application is mixed among the various elements that include modified retrospective and prospective transition methods. management does not expect that changes in its accounting required by the new standard will materially impact the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
73
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements asu 2018-02 income statement - reporting comprehensive income: in february 2018, the fasb issued this standard that allows the reclassification from aoci to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ("tax reform act"). the amount of the reclassification is the effect of the change in the u.s.
federal corporate income tax rate on the gross deferred tax amounts and related valuation allowances related to items remaining in aoci. this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period, for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. the company will adopt this standard beginning first quarter 2019, and it is not expected to have a material impact to the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2018-13 fair value measurement - disclosure framework - changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement: in august 2018, the fasb issued this update as a part of its disclosure framework project to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to financial statements. this standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption was permitted upon issuance of this update and an entity is permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of this update and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until the effective date. certain disclosure amendments are to be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented, while other amendments are to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. management is currently evaluating implementation options and impact on the company's related disclosures.
asu 2018-14 retirement benefits - disclosure framework - changes to the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans: in august 2018, the fasb issued this update as a part of its disclosure framework project to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to financial statements. this standard is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. upon adoption, this update is to be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. management is currently evaluating the impact on the company's related disclosures.
asu 2018-15 internal-use software - customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract: in august 2018, the fasb issued this update. this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. this standard is to be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. management is currently evaluating implementation options and impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
2018-16 derivatives and hedging - inclusion of the secured overnight financing rate ( " sofr") overnight index swap
("ois") rate as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes: in october 2018, the fasb issued this update that permits the use of the ois rate based on sofr as a u.s. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. for entities that have already adopted 2017-12, above, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. the company will adopt this standard beginning first quarter 2019, and anticipates adopting on a prospective basis for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships.
2018-18 collaborative arrangements - clarifying the interaction between topic 808 (collaborative arrangements) and topic 606 (revenue from contracts with customers): in november 2018, the fasb issued clarification in regards to which contracts are accounted for under topic 808 and topic 606 as well as alignment of guidance between the two topics. this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted. upon adoption, this update is to be applied retrospectively to the date of initial application of topic 606. management is currently evaluating the impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements fair value measurements eastman records recurring and non-recurring financial assets and liabilities as well as all non-financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. these fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels. level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the company's assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. an asset or liability's classification within the various levels is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. eastman maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. the company calculates the allowance based on an assessment of the risk in the accounts receivable portfolio. write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. allowance for doubtful accounts was $11 million and $12 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. the company does not enter into receivables of a long-term nature, also known as financing receivables, in the normal course of business.
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. eastman determines the cost of most raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories in the united states and switzerland by the last-in, first-out ("lifo")
method. the cost of all other inventories is determined by the average cost method, which approximates the first-
in, first-out ("fifo") method. the company writes-down its inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
properties eastman records properties at cost. maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings; replacements and betterments are capitalized. when eastman retires or otherwise disposes of assets, it removes the cost of such assets and related accumulated depreciation from the accounts. the company records any profit or loss on retirement or other disposition into earnings. asset impairments are reflected as increases in accumulated depreciation for properties that have been placed in service. in instances when an asset has not been placed in service and is impaired, the associated costs are removed from the appropriate property accounts.
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense is calculated based on historical cost and the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally using the straight-line method. estimated useful lives for buildings and building equipment generally range from 20
to 50 years. estimated useful lives generally ranging from 3 to 33 years are applied to machinery and equipment in the following categories: computer software (3 to 5 years); office furniture and fixtures and computer equipment (5
to 10 years); vehicles, railcars, and general machinery and equipment (5 to 20 years); and manufacturing-related improvements (20 to 33 years). accelerated depreciation is reported when the estimated useful life is shortened and continues to be reported in cost of sales.
amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets is generally determined using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
for additional information, see note 4, "goodwill and other intangible assets" .
75
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements impairment of long-lived assets definite-lived assets properties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by eastman are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the review of properties and equipment is performed at the asset group level and the review of definite-lived intangible assets is performed at the asset level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. if the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. an impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants .
goodwill eastman conducts testing of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. the testing of goodwill is performed at the "reporting unit" level which the company has determined to be its "components". components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a "business"
as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by company operating segment management. the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities.
on october 1, 2018, management adopted asu 2017-04 intangibles - goodwill and other to simplify the annual goodwill impairment testing process. a reporting unit's goodwill is considered to be impaired when the reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. the company uses an income approach and applies a fair value methodology based on discounted cash flows in testing the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit. key assumptions and estimates used in the company's 2018 goodwill impairment testing included projections of revenues, expenses, and cash flows determined using the company's annual multi-year strategic plan and a market participant tax rate. the most critical assumptions are the estimated discount rate and a projected long-term growth rate. the company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made. however, actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the company's estimates. in addition, the use of different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different determinations. in order to determine the discount rate, the company uses a market participant weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") approach. the wacc is calculated incorporating weighted average returns on debt and equity from market participants. therefore, changes in the market, which are beyond the control of the company, may have an impact on future calculations of estimated fair value.
indefinite-lived intangible assets eastman conducts testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired when the fair value, as established by appraisal or based on discounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than the respective carrying value.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of various tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. the company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, to test indefinite-lived intangible assets. the estimated fair value of tradenames is determined based on an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant wacc plus a risk premium.

investments the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of eastman and all its subsidiaries and entities or joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained.
76
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements investments in affiliates over which the company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis. under the equity method of accounting, these investments are included in other noncurrent assets. the company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in "other (income)
charges, net", and its share of "other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax" ("oci") located in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings and in the appropriate component of aoci located in the consolidated statements of financial position.
pension and other postretirement benefits eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. under its other postretirement benefit plans in the u.s., eastman provides life insurance for eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007. eastman provides a subsidy for pre-medicare health care and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 that will end on december 31, 2021. company funding is also provided for eligible medicare retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 with a health reimbursement arrangement. the estimated amounts of the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company's assumptions related to discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase or decrease for employees, and health care cost trends. the estimated cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation.
eastman's pension and other postretirement benefit plans costs consist of two elements: 1) ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service credits; and 2) mark-to-market ("mtm") gains and losses recognized annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, primarily resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets. any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement, or significant plan changes are recognized in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs.
for additional information, see note 10, "retirement plans" .
environmental costs eastman accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the company accrues the minimum undiscounted amount. this undiscounted accrued amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years and the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.
the company also establishes reserves for closure and post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and surface impoundments. when these types of assets are constructed or installed, a loss contingency reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements.
the company recognizes the asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. these future estimated costs are charged to earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. if the company changes its estimate of the environmental asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses charged to earnings will be impacted.
the current portion of accruals for environmental liabilities is included in payables and other current liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other long-term liabilities. these accruals exclude claims for recoveries from insurance companies or other third parties. environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, or mitigate or prevent future contamination. the cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to expense as incurred.
for additional information see note 12, "environmental matters and asset retirement obligations" .
77
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements derivative and non-derivative financial instruments eastman uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
counterparties to the derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance and the company diversifies its positions among such counterparties to reduce its exposure to counterparty risk and credit losses. the company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties on an ongoing basis.
the company's derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position and measured at fair value. for qualifying derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value are reported as a component of aoci in the consolidated statements of financial position and recognized in earnings when the hedged items affect earnings. for qualifying derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value are reported as
"long-term borrowings" on the consolidated statements of financial position and recognized in earnings when the hedged items affect earnings. for qualifying derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges, the net change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged is reported as a component of "cumulative translation adjustment" ("cta") within aoci located in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. any hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings, the initial value of the excluded component, using a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument. changes in the fair value of nonqualifying derivatives or derivatives that are not designated as hedges, are recognized in current earnings. hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively for all hedges that no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment. cash flows from derivative instruments designated as hedges are reported in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.
for additional information, see note 9, "derivative and non-derivative financial instruments" .
litigation and contingent liabilities eastman and its operations from time to time are, and in the future, may be, parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. the company accrues a contingent loss liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the company accrues the minimum amount. the company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.
revenue recognition and customer incentives as noted above, on january 1, 2018, eastman adopted asu 2014-09 revenue recognition (asc 606). for accounting policy and elections, see note 22, "revenue recognition" .
restructuring of operations eastman records restructuring charges for costs incurred in connection with consolidation of operations, exited business or product lines, or shutdowns of specific sites that are expected to be substantially completed within twelve months. these restructuring charges are recorded as incurred, and are associated with site closures, legal and environmental matters, demolition, contract terminations, obsolete inventory, or other costs and charges directly related to the restructuring. the company records severance charges for employee separations when the separation is probable and reasonably estimable. in the event employees are required to perform future service, the company records severance charges ratably over the remaining service period of those employees. for additional information, see note 15, "asset impairments and restructuring charges, net" .
share-based compensation eastman recognizes compensation expense in the financial statements for stock options and other share-based compensation awards based upon the grant-date fair value over the substantive vesting period. for additional information, see note 17, "share-based compensation plans and awards" .
78
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements income taxes the provision for (benefit from) income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. the provision for (benefit from)
income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of eastman's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.
the company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision.
in conjunction with its evaluation of the provisions of the tax reform act, in 2018, the company made an accounting policy election to account for taxes resulting from the global intangible low-tax income ("gilti") as a component of the provision for income taxes.

2018
in fourth quarter 2018, as a result of the annual impairment test of goodwill, the company recognized a $38 million goodwill impairment in the crop protection reporting unit (part of the additives & functions products ("afp")
segment). the impairment was primarily driven by an increase in the wacc applied to the impairment analysis and the estimated impact of future regulatory changes. the company used an income approach and applied a fair value methodology based on discounted cash flows in testing the carrying value of goodwill for the crop protection reporting unit.
as of december 31, 2018, the reported balance of goodwill included accumulated impairment losses of $61 million ,
$12 million , and $14 million in the afp segment, chemical intermediates ("ci") segment, and other segments, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, the reported balance of goodwill included accumulated impairment losses of
$23 million , $12 million , and $14 million in the afp segment, ci segment, and other segments, respectively.

7.  income taxes as previously reported, the company recognized a provisional net tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2017 , resulting from the tax reform act. in 2017, the company recognized a $339 million estimated net tax benefit, primarily resulting from the tax reform act and a tax loss from outside-u.s. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center. the net tax benefit included a $533 million benefit from the one-time revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income of $71 million and $123 million in changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with tax law changes and outside-u.s. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center.
as of december 31, 2018 the company considers the accounting under sab 118 for the impacts of the tax reform act to be complete. in preparing the amounts as of december 31, 2018 the company considered notices, revenue procedures, and proposed regulations issued by the internal revenue service and authoritative accounting guidance to date. in
2018, the company recognized an adjustment to the 2017 net tax benefit which decreased earnings by $20 million primarily related to the one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income and changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with tax law changes and outside-u.s. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center.
as of december 31, 2018, the u.s. department of treasury has issued a number of proposed regulations related to implementation of the provisions of the tax reform act and certain states may issue clarifying guidance regarding state income tax conformity to the current federal tax code. finalization of these regulations in 2019 or future periods may result in changes in the period of enactment to the amounts currently reported in the consolidated statements of financial position.
81
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the income tax payable for the transition tax will be paid over eight years. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, a non-current income tax payable of approximately $56 million and $60 million , respectively, attributable to the transition tax is reflected in "other long-term liabilities" of the consolidated statements of financial position.
in conjunction with its evaluation of the provisions of the tax reform act, in 2018, the company made an accounting policy election to account for taxes resulting from gilti as a component of the provision for income taxes.

the 2018 effective tax rate includes the impact of the u.s. corporate tax rate reduction resulting from the tax reform act and the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction. the 2018 effective tax rate also includes a $20
million increase to the provision for income taxes resulting from adjustments to the provisional net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017 resulting from tax law changes, primarily the tax reform act. these adjustments related to the one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income and changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with tax law changes and outside-u.s. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center.
the 2017 effective tax rate includes a $339 million net tax benefit, primarily resulting from the tax reform act, and a tax loss from outside-u.s. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center, a $20 million benefit due to amendments to prior years' domestic income tax returns, and a $30
million benefit reflecting the finalization of prior years' foreign income tax returns. the 2017 effective tax rate also includes an $8 million tax benefit due to a tax ruling permitting deductibility of a liquidation loss on a previously impaired site.
the 2016 effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of $16 million related to foreign tax credits as a result of the amendment of prior year income tax returns, a $16 million one-time benefit for the restoration of tax basis for which depreciation deductions were previously limited, and a $9 million tax benefit primarily due to adjustments to the tax provision to reflect the finalization of 2014 foreign income tax returns.

as of december 31, 2018 , the company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1.3 billion . as of december 31, 2017, the company had accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1.2 billion , which was subject to the one-time transition tax of $71 million on deferred foreign income as required by the tax reform act. beginning january 1, 2019, the company is not asserting indefinite reinvestment on short-term liquid assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. all other foreign earnings, including basis differences of certain foreign subsidiaries, continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested.
for certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, income and losses directly flow through to taxable income in the u.s. these entities are also subject to taxation in the foreign tax jurisdictions. net operating loss carryforwards exist to offset future taxable income in foreign tax jurisdictions and valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred related tax assets if it is more likely than not that this benefit will not be realized. changes in the estimated realizable amount of deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses for these entities could result in changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the foreign tax jurisdiction. at the same time, because these entities are also subject to tax in the u.s., a deferred tax liability for the expected future taxable income will be established concurrently. therefore, the impact of any reversal of valuation allowances on consolidated income tax expense will be only to the extent that there are differences between the u.s. statutory tax rate and the tax rate in the foreign jurisdiction. a valuation allowance of $20 million at december 31, 2018
has been provided against the deferred tax asset resulting from these operating loss carryforwards.
at december 31, 2018 , foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaled $2.5 billion . of this total, $145 million will expire in 1 to 20 years and $2.4 billion have no expiration date. a valuation allowance of approximately $304
million has been provided against such net operating loss carryforwards.
84
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements at december 31, 2018 , federal net operating loss carryforwards of $12 million were available to offset future taxable income, which expire from 2028 to 2030. at december 31, 2018 , foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $64 million were available to reduce possible future u.s. income taxes and which expire from 2019 to
2028. as a result of the tax reform act, the company may no longer be able to utilize the solutia, inc. ("solutia")
u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards; therefore, management established a full valuation allowance of $48 million on the remaining deferred tax asset as of december 31, 2018 .
at december 31, 2018 , a valuation allowance of $36 million was established against state tax credits that the company may not be able to utilize.
a partial valuation allowance of $54 million has been established for the solutia state net operating loss carryforwards. the valuation allowance will be retained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, or the related statute expires.

all of the unrecognized tax benefits would, if recognized, impact the company's effective tax rate.
interest, net of tax, related to unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as a component of income tax expense. as of january 1, 2018 , eastman had accrued a liability of $6 million for interest, net of tax, and $1 million for estimated tax penalties. during 2018 , the company recognized $4 million of expense for interest, net of tax, and no penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, no income for interest, net of tax, and no penalties, associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations. at december 31, 2018 , the company had accrued balances of $10 million for interest, net of tax benefit, and $1 million for penalties.
as of january 1, 2017 , eastman had accrued a liability of $4 million for interest, net of tax, and $1 million for tax penalties. during 2017 , the company recognized $3 million of expense for interest, net of tax, and no penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, offset by $1 million of income for interest, net of tax, and no penalties, associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations. at december 31, 2017, the company had accrued balances of $6 million for interest, net of tax benefit, and $1 million for penalties.
as of january 1, 2016 , eastman had accrued a liability of $4 million for interest, net of tax, and $1 million for tax penalties. during 2016 , the company recognized $1 million of expense for interest, net of tax, and no penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, offset by $1 million of income for interest, net of tax, and no of penalties, associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations. at december 31, 2016 , the company had accrued balances of $4 million for interest, net of tax benefit, and $1 million for penalties.
85
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements eastman files income tax returns in the united states and various state and foreign jurisdictions. the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011 for eastman legal entities and years before 2002 for solutia legal entities. with few exceptions, eastman is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011. solutia and related subsidiaries are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for years before 2000. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2011.
it is reasonably possible that, as a result of the resolution of federal, state, and foreign examinations and appeals, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next twelve months by up to $8 million .

million principal). total consideration for these redemptions were $806 million ( $800 million total principal and
$6 million for the early redemption premiums) and are reported as financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. the early repayment resulted in a charge of $7 million for early debt extinguishment costs which were primarily attributable to the early redemption premiums and related unamortized costs. the book value of the redeemed debt was $799 million .

borrowings under this facility are subject to interest at an agreed spread above libor and euribor plus administration and insurance fees and are classified as short-term. the amount of outstanding borrowings under this facility were $112 million at december 31, 2018 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.70 percent .
the credit and a/r facilities and other borrowing agreements contain customary covenants and events of default, some of which require the company to maintain certain financial ratios that determine the amounts available and terms of borrowings. the company was in compliance with all covenants at both december 31, 2018 and december 31,
2017 .
fair value of borrowings eastman has classified its total borrowings at december 31, 2018 and 2017 under the fair value hierarchy as defined in the accounting policies in note 1, "significant accounting policies" . the fair value for fixed-rate debt securities is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments and is classified as level 2.
the fair value for the company's other borrowings primarily under the 2021 term loan, commercial paper, a/r facility, and receivables facility equals the carrying value and is classified as level 2. at december 31, 2018 and
2017 , the fair value of total borrowings was $6,216 million and $6,980 million , respectively. the company had no borrowings classified as level 1 or level 3 as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 .

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
9.  derivative and non-derivative financial instruments overview of hedging programs eastman is exposed to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. to mitigate these market risks and their effects on the cash flows of the underlying transactions and investments in foreign subsidiaries, the company uses various derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, when appropriate, in accordance with the company's hedging strategy and policies. designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk. the derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. the change in the hedge instrument is reported as a component of aoci located in the consolidated statements of financial position and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
foreign currency exchange rate hedging eastman manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. to manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets. to manage the remaining exposure, the company enters into currency option and forward cash flow hedges to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period and denominated in foreign currencies (principally the euro). additionally, the company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contract cash flow hedges to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
commodity hedging certain raw material and energy sources used by eastman, as well as sales of certain commodity products by the company, are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply and demand conditions, economic variables and other unpredictable factors. this volatility is primarily related to the market pricing of propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, ethylene, and benzene. in order to mitigate expected fluctuations in market prices, from time to time, the company enters into option and forward contracts and designates these contracts as cash flow hedges. the company currently hedges commodity price risks using derivative financial instrument transactions within a rolling three year period. the company weights its hedge portfolio more heavily in the first year with declining coverage over the remaining periods.
interest rate hedging eastman's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. to manage interest rate risk effectively, the company, from time to time, enters into cash flow interest rate derivative instruments, primarily forward starting swaps and treasury locks, to hedge the company's exposure to movements in interest rates prior to anticipated debt offerings. these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.
fair value hedges fair value hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk. the derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated fair value of the underlying exposures being hedged. the net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying fair value hedges is recognized in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
88
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements interest rate hedging eastman's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. to manage the company's mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively, from time to time, the company enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. these swaps are designated as hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt obligations and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps.
net investment hedges net investment hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. the net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying net investment hedges is reported as a component of the cta within aoci located in the consolidated statements of financial position. recognition in earnings of amounts previously recognized in cta is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation.
for derivative cross-currency interest rate swap net investment hedges, gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in cta within aoci and recognized in earnings through the periodic swap interest accruals. the cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges are included as part of "other long-term liabilities" or "other noncurrent assets" within the consolidated statements of financial position.
in january 2018, eastman entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps and designated these swaps to hedge a portion of its net investment in a euro functional currency denominated subsidiary against foreign currency fluctuations. these contracts involve the exchange of fixed u.s. dollars with fixed euro interest payments periodically over the life of the contracts and an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. the fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps include €150 million ( $180 million ) maturing january 2021 and €266 million ( $320 million )
maturing august 2022.
in october 2018, eastman entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps and designated these swaps to hedge a portion of its net investment in a euro functional currency denominated subsidiary against foreign currency fluctuations. these contracts involve the exchange of fixed u.s. dollars with fixed euro interest payments periodically over the life of the contracts and an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. the fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps include €165 million ( $190 million ) maturing january 2024, €104 million ( $120 million )
maturing march 2025, and €165 million ( $190 million ) maturing february 2027.

fair value measurements for additional information on fair value measurement, see note 1, "significant accounting policies" .
all the company's derivative assets and liabilities are currently classified as level 2. level 2 fair value is based on estimates using standard pricing models. these standard pricing models use inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. the fair value of commodity contracts is derived using forward curves supplied by an industry recognized and unrelated third party. in addition, on an ongoing basis, the company tests a subset of its valuations against valuations received from the transaction's counterparty to validate the accuracy of its standard pricing models.
counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance and the company diversifies its positions among such counterparties to reduce its exposure to counterparty risk and credit losses. the company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties on an ongoing basis. the company did not realize a credit loss during the years ended december 31,
2018 or 2017 .
all the company's derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, which provide for the option to settle contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day and in the same currency. in addition, these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event. the company does not have any cash collateral due under such agreements.

the company enters into foreign exchange derivatives denominated in multiple currencies which are transacted and settled in the same quarter. these derivatives are not designated as hedges due to the short-term nature and the gains or losses on these derivatives are marked-to-market in line item "other (income) charges, net" of the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. the company recognized a net loss of $13 million and net gain of $1 million during 2018 and 2017 , respectively, on these derivatives.
pre-tax monetized positions and mtm gains and losses from raw materials and energy, currency, and certain interest rate hedges that were included in aoci included losses of $112 million at december 31, 2018 and losses of $214
million at december 31, 2017 . losses in aoci decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily as a result of a decrease in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the euro. if realized, approximately $10 million in pre-
tax losses will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months.

defined contribution plans eastman sponsors a defined contribution employee stock ownership plan (the "esop"), which is a component of the eastman investment plan and employee stock ownership plan ("eip/esop"), under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code. eastman made a contribution in february 2019 to the eip/esop for substantially all u.s. employees equal to 5 percent of their eligible compensation for the 2018 plan year. employees may allocate contributions to other investment funds within the eip from the esop at any time without restrictions. allocated shares in the esop totaled 2,119,614 ; 2,130,176 ; and 2,183,950 shares as of december 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
dividends on shares held by the eip/esop are charged to retained earnings. all shares held by the eip/esop are treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share.
in 2006, the company amended its eip/esop to provide a company match of 50 percent of the first 7 percent of an employee's compensation contributed to the plan for employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007. employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007, are also eligible for the contribution to the esop as described above.
charges for domestic contributions to the eip/esop were $67 million , $64 million , and $63 million for 2018 , 2017
, and 2016 , respectively.
defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans pension plans eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits.
effective january 1, 2000, the company's eastman retirement assistance plan, a u.s. defined benefit pension plan, was amended. employees' accrued pension benefits earned prior to january 1, 2000 are calculated based on previous plan provisions using the employee's age, years of service, and final average compensation as defined in the plans.
the amended plan uses a pension equity formula to calculate an employee's retirement benefits from january 1, 2000
forward. benefits payable will be the combined pre-2000 and post-1999 benefits. employees hired on or after january
1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in eastman's u.s. defined benefit pension plans.
benefits are paid to employees from trust funds. contributions to the trust funds are made as permitted by laws and regulations. the pension trust funds do not directly own any of the company's common stock.
pension coverage for employees of eastman's non-u.s. operations is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. the company systematically provides for obligations under such plans by depositing funds with trustees, under insurance policies, or by book reserves.
other postretirement benefit plans under its other postretirement benefit plans in the u.s., eastman provides life insurance for eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007. eastman provides a subsidy for pre-medicare health care and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 that will end on december 31, 2021. company funding is also provided for eligible medicare retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 with a health reimbursement arrangement. a few of the company's non-u.s. operations have supplemental health benefit plans for certain retirees, the cost of which is not significant to the company.

in fourth quarter 2016, eastman changed benefits provided to retirees by an eastman other postretirement benefit plan which triggered a remeasurement of the plan's obligation. the remeasurement resulted in a pre-tax reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $106 million which will be amortized as a prior service credit from aoci over approximately eight years. the remeasurement was included in the 2016 year end remeasurement process.
in third quarter 2016, the company announced a change to a uk defined benefit pension plan which triggered an interim remeasurement of the plan obligation resulting in a mtm loss of $30 million . the mtm loss was primarily due to a lower discount rate at the third quarter 2016 remeasurement date compared to december 31, 2015. the lower discount rate was reflective of changes in global market conditions and interest rates on high-grade corporate bonds. the plan was remeasured in fourth quarter 2016 as part of the annual mtm remeasurement process.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in first quarter 2016, the company changed the approach used to calculate service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the company elected to calculate service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. the change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation or the annual net periodic benefit cost or credit of the plans because the change in the service and interest costs will be offset in the mtm actuarial gain or loss which typically is recognized in the fourth quarter of each year or in any other quarters in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. the change in the approach for full-year
2016 pre-tax expense was an increase to service cost of approximately $2 million and a reduction in interest cost of approximately $22 million compared to the previous method. the net reduction of approximately $20 million was offset by a mtm loss as part of the annual remeasurement of the plans in fourth quarter 2016.
the estimated prior service credit for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from aoci into net periodic cost in 2019 is $39 million .

a 6.50 percent rate of increase in per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed for 2019 . the rate is assumed to decrease gradually to five percent in 2025 and remain at that level thereafter. a one percent increase or decrease in health care cost trend would have had no material impact on the 2018 service and interest costs or the 2018 benefit obligation, because the company's contributions for benefits are fixed.
in 2017, the company performed a five year experience study on assumptions for the u.s. plans, including a review of the mortality tables. as a result of the study, the company has updated the mortality assumptions used to a modified rp-2017 table with a modified mp-2017 improvement scale and no collar adjustment.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the fair value of plan assets for the u.s. pension plans at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.8 billion and $2.1
billion , respectively, while the fair value of plan assets at december 31, 2018 and 2017 for non-u.s. pension plans was $713 million and $773 million , respectively. at december 31, 2018 and 2017 , the expected weighted-
average long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.43 percent and 7.48 percent, respectively. the expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on non-u.s. pension plans assets was 4.49 percent and 4.83
percent at december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

investment strategy eastman's investment strategy for its defined benefit pension plans is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to meet or exceed the plan's actuarially assumed long-term rate of return and to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. a periodic asset/liability study is conducted in order to assist in the determination and, if necessary, modification of the appropriate long-term investment policy for the plan. the investment policy establishes a target allocation range for each asset class and the fund is managed within those ranges. the plans use a number of investment approaches including investments in equity, real estate, and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable in order to achieve this target allocation. the plans also invest in private equity and other funds. diversification is created through investments across various asset classes, geographies, fund managers, and individual securities. this investment process is designed to provide for a well-diversified portfolio with no significant concentration of risk. the investment process is monitored by an investment committee that includes senior management.
eastman's investment strategy for its veba trust is to invest in intermediate-term, well diversified, high quality investment instruments, with a primary objective of capital preservation.
the expected rate of return for all plans was determined primarily by modeling the expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments held by the plans and the targeted allocation percentage against various potential economic scenarios.
the company made no contributions to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans in 2018 or 2017 . for 2019 calendar year, there are no minimum required cash contributions for the u.s. defined benefit pension plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, and the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.
the estimated future benefit payments, reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:

estimated future payments of debt securities assumes the repayment of principal upon stated maturity, and actual amounts and the timing of such payments may differ materially due to repayment or other changes in the terms of such debt prior to maturity.
eastman had various purchase obligations at december 31, 2018 totaling approximately $2.8 billion over a period of approximately 30 years for materials, supplies, and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. the company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under noncancelable operating leases totaling
$248 million over a period of approximately 40 years. of the total lease commitments, approximately 50 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; approximately 40 percent relate to railcars; and approximately 10 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment. rental expense, net of sublease income, was $103 million , $94 million , and
$90 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
amounts in other liabilities represent the current estimated cash payments required to be made by the company primarily for pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental loss contingency reserves, accrued compensation benefits, uncertain tax liabilities, one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income under the tax reform act, and commodity and foreign exchange hedging in the periods indicated. due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, management is unable to determine the timing of payments related to uncertain tax liabilities and these amounts are included in the "2024 and beyond"
line item.
guarantees eastman has operating leases with terms that require the company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease as well as other guarantees. disclosures about each group of similar guarantees are provided below.
residual value guarantees the company has operating leases with terms that require the company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease. these residual value guarantees totaled $68 million at december
31, 2018 and consist primarily of leases for railcars that will expire beginning in second quarter 2019. residual guarantee payments that become probable and estimable are recognized as rent expense over the remaining life of the applicable lease. management's current expectation is that the likelihood of material residual guarantee payments is remote.
101
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements other guarantees guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, and other parties when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified triggering events occur. non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company. the company's current other guarantees include guarantees relating to intellectual property, environmental matters, and other indemnifications and have arisen through the normal course of business.
the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims, if they were to occur. these other guarantees have terms up to 30 years with maximum potential future payments of approximately $35 million in the aggregate, with none of these guarantees being individually significant to the company's operating results, financial position, or liquidity. management's current expectation is that future payment or performance related to non-performance under other guarantees is remote.
other off balance sheet arrangements the company has off balance sheet uncommitted non-recourse factoring facilities that include customer specific receivables in the united states and europe. the company sells the receivables at face value, less a transaction fee, which substantially equals the carrying value and fair value with no gain or loss recognized. there is no continuing involvement with these receivables once sold and no credit loss exposure. the total amount of receivables sold during 2018 and 2017 were $169 million and $35 million , respectively.
in october 2018, eastman added an uncommitted non-recourse factoring facility under which the company sells undivided interests in certain receivables and provides servicing at market rates with no credit loss exposure. the company sells the receivables at face value, less a transaction fee, which substantially equals the carrying value and fair value with no gain or loss recognized. the total amount of receivables sold during 2018 was $50 million .
12.  environmental matters and asset retirement obligations certain eastman manufacturing facilities generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies. in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("prp") by the u.s. environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for certain cleanup costs. in addition, the company will incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and post-closure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act. reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with eastman's policies described in note 1, "significant accounting policies" . although the resolution of uncertainties related to these environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, because of the availability of legal defenses, the company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and, if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. the company's total reserve for environmental loss contingencies was $296 million and $304 million at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 , respectively.
environmental remediation and environmental asset retirement obligations the company's total environmental reserve that management believes to be probable and reasonably estimable for environmental contingencies, including remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, is included as part of
"payables and other current liabilities" and "other long-term liabilities" in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows:

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements environmental remediation estimated future environmental expenditures for undiscounted remediation costs ranged from the best estimate or minimum of $271 million to the maximum of $508 million and from the best estimate or minimum of $280 million to the maximum of $483 million at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 , respectively. the best estimate or minimum estimated future environmental expenditures are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable and include the amounts accrued at both december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 .
costs of certain remediation projects included in the environmental reserve are subject to a cost-sharing arrangement with monsanto company ("monsanto") under the provisions of the amended and restated settlement agreement effective february 28, 2008 (the "effective date"), into which solutia entered with monsanto upon its emergence from bankruptcy (the "monsanto settlement agreement"). under the provisions of the monsanto settlement agreement, solutia, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of eastman on july 2, 2012, shares responsibility with monsanto for remediation at certain locations outside of the boundaries of plant sites in anniston, alabama and sauget, illinois (the "shared sites"). solutia is responsible for the funding of environmental liabilities at the shared sites up to a total of $325 million from the effective date. if remediation costs for the shared sites exceed this amount, such costs will thereafter be shared equally between solutia and monsanto. including payments by solutia prior to its acquisition by eastman, $93 million had been paid for costs at the shared sites as of december 31, 2018 . as of december 31, 2018 , an additional $203 million has been accrued for estimated future remediation costs at the shared sites, over a period of approximately 30 years .
reserves for environmental remediation include liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years . the amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are included within "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. changes in the reserves for environmental remediation liabilities for twelve months ended 2018 are summarized below:

environmental asset retirement obligations an asset retirement obligation is an obligation for the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. eastman recognizes a sset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. the associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful life. environmental asset retirement obligations consist of primarily closure and post-closure costs. for sites that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate recognized to date for these environmental asset retirement obligation costs was $25
million and $24 million at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 , respectively.
other environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, or mitigate the possibility of future contamination. the cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to expense as incurred. eastman's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $274 million , $257 million , and $267 million in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively, and include operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, engineering costs, and construction costs. the cash expenditures above include environmental capital expenditures of approximately $44
million , $38 million , and $45 million in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.
103
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company also has contractual asset retirement obligations not associated with environmental liabilities.
eastman's non-environmental asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the future closure of leased manufacturing assets at pace, florida and oulu, finland. these recognized non-environmental asset retirement obligations were $46 million and $49 million at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 , respectively, and is included as part of "other long-term liabilities" in the consolidated statements of financial position.
13.  legal matters from time to time, eastman and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. while the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company established a benefit security trust in 1997 to provide a degree of financial security for unfunded obligations under certain unfunded plans and contributed to the trust a warrant to purchase up to 6 million shares of common stock of the company for par value. the warrant, which remains outstanding, is exercisable by the trustee if the company does not meet certain funding obligations, which obligations would be triggered by certain occurrences, including a change in control or potential change in control, as defined, or failure by the company to meet its payment obligations under certain covered unfunded plans. such warrant is excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the conditions upon which the warrant becomes exercisable have not been met.
the additions to paid-in capital in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 are primarily for compensation expense of equity awards and employee stock option exercises.
in february 2014, the company's board of directors authorized repurchase of up to $1 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. the company completed the $1 billion of repurchases in may 2018, acquiring a total of
12,215,950 shares. in february 2018, the company's board of directors authorized repurchase of up to $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interests of the company. as of december 31, 2018 , a total of 2,470,755 shares have been repurchased under this authorization for a total of $248 million . during 2018 , the company repurchased

17.  share-based compensation plans and awards
2017 omnibus stock compensation plan eastman's 2017 omnibus stock compensation plan ("2017 omnibus plan") was approved by stockholders at the may 4,
2017 annual meeting of stockholders and shall remain in effect until its fifth anniversary. the 2017 omnibus plan authorizes the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors to grant awards, designate participants, determine the types and numbers of awards, determine the terms and conditions of awards and determine the form of award settlement. under the 2017 omnibus plan, the aggregate number of shares reserved and available for issuance is 10 million , which consist of shares not previously authorized for issuance under any other plan. the number of shares covered by an award is counted against this share reserve as of the grant date of the award. shares covered by full value awards (e.g. performance shares and restricted stock awards) are counted against the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under the plan as 2.5 shares for every one share covered by the award. any stock distributed pursuant to an award may consist of, in whole or in part, authorized and unissued stock, treasury stock, or stock purchased on the open market. under the 2017 omnibus plan and previous plans, the forms of awards have included restricted stock and restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights ("sars"), and performance shares. the 2017 omnibus plan is flexible as to the number of specific forms of awards, but provides that stock options and sars are to be granted at an exercise price not less than 100 percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the grant .
109
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements director stock compensation subplan eastman's 2018 director stock compensation subplan ("directors' subplan"), a component of the 2017 omnibus plan, remains in effect until terminated by the board of directors or the earlier termination of the 2017 omnibus plan.
the directors' subplan provides for structured awards of restricted shares to non-employee members of the board of directors. restricted shares awarded under the directors' subplan are subject to the same terms and conditions of the 2017 omnibus plan. the directors' subplan does not constitute a separate source of shares for grant of equity awards and all shares awarded are part of the 10 million shares authorized under the 2017 omnibus plan. shares of restricted stock are granted on the first day of a non-employee director's initial term of service and shares of restricted stock are granted each year to each non-employee director on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders.
it has been the company's practice to issue new shares rather than treasury shares for equity awards for compensation plans, including the 2017 omnibus plan and the directors' subplan, that require settlement by the issuance of common stock and to withhold or accept back shares awarded to cover the related income tax obligations of employee participants. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by non-employee directors are not eligible to be withheld or acquired to satisfy the withholding obligation related to their income taxes. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by specified senior management level employees are accepted by the company to pay the exercise price of stock options in accordance with the terms and conditions of their awards.
compensation expense for 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , total share-based compensation expense (before tax) of approximately $64 million , $52
million , and $36 million , respectively, was recognized in "selling, general and administrative expense" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings for all share-based awards of which approximately $9 million , $8 million , and $7 million , respectively, related to stock options. the compensation expense is recognized over the substantive vesting period, which may be a shorter time period than the stated vesting period for qualifying termination eligible employees as defined in the forms of award notice. approximately
$3 million for 2018 , and $2 million for both 2017 and 2016 , of stock option compensation expense was recognized each year due to qualifying termination eligibility preceding the requisite vesting period.
stock option awards options have been granted on an annual basis to non-employee directors under the directors' subplan and predecessor plans and by the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors under the 2017 omnibus plan and predecessor plans to employees. option awards have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's stock on the date of grant. the term of options is 10 years with vesting periods that vary up to three years. vesting usually occurs ratably over the vesting period or at the end of the vesting period. the company utilizes the black scholes merton option valuation model which relies on certain assumptions to estimate an option's fair value.
the weighted average assumptions used in the determination of fair value for stock options awarded in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 are provided in the table below:
assumptions                          2018      2017      2016
expected volatility rate           19.03%    20.45%    23.71%
expected dividend yield             2.48%     2.64%     2.31%
average risk-free interest rate     2.61%     1.91%     1.23%
expected term years                   5.1       5.0       5.0
the volatility rate of grants is derived from historical company common stock price volatility over the same time period as the expected term of each stock option award. the volatility rate is derived by mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high closing stock price data over the expected term.
the expected dividend yield is calculated using the company's average of the last four quarterly dividend yields .
the average risk-free interest rate is derived from united states department of treasury published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period as the expected term.
110
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the weighted average expected term reflects the analysis of historical share-based award transactions and includes option swap and reload grants which may have much shorter remaining expected terms than new option grants.

other share-based compensation awards in addition to stock option awards, eastman has awarded long-term performance share awards, restricted stock awards, and sars. the long-term performance share awards are based upon actual return on capital compared to a target return on capital and total stockholder return compared to a peer group ranking by total stockholder return over a three year performance period. the awards are valued using a monte carlo simulation based model and vest pro-rata over the three year performance period. the number of long-term performance award target shares granted for the 2018-2020, 2017-2019, and 2016-2018 periods were 310 thousand , 357 thousand , and 427 thousand , respectively. the target shares granted are assumed to be 100 percent. at the end of the three-year performance period, the actual number of shares awarded can range from zero percent to 250 percent of the target shares granted based on the award notice. the number of restricted stock awards granted during 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 were 160
thousand , 172 thousand , and 190 thousand , respectively. the fair value of a restricted stock award is equal to the closing stock price of the company's stock on the date of grant and normally vests over a period of three years. the recognized compensation expense before tax for these other share-based awards in the years ended december 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was approximately $55 million , $44 million , and $29 million , respectively.

22.  revenue recognition on january 1, 2018, eastman adopted asu 2014-09 revenue recognition (asc 606). under this standard, the company recognizes revenue when performance obligations of the sale are satisfied. eastman sells to customers through master sales agreements or standalone purchase orders. the majority of the company's terms of sale have a single performance obligation to transfer products. accordingly, the company recognizes revenue when control has been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products. under the previous revenue recognition accounting standard, the company recognized revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss, generally upon delivery of goods. for further information, see note 1, "significant accounting policies" .
the company's arrangement with a customer may include the act of shipping product to customers after the performance obligation related to that product has been satisfied. the company has elected to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good and has not allocated revenue to the shipping activity. all related shipping and handling costs are recognized at the time of shipment. further, the company's sales arrangements may include the collection of sales and other similar taxes that are then remitted to the related taxing authority. the company has elected to present the amounts collected for these taxes net of the related tax expense rather than presenting them as additional revenue.
the company has elected to adopt several practical expedients as part of the adoption of asu 2014-09 / asc 606. the company has elected the practical expedient to recognize the incremental cost of obtaining a sale (selling expense)
as an expense when incurred given the potential amortization period for such asset is one year or less. further, the company has elected to use the practical expedient that allows the company to ignore the possible existence of a significant financing component within sales arrangements where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year. finally, the company has elected the practical expedient to not disclose unfulfilled obligations as customer purchase order commitments have an original expected duration of one year or less and no consideration from customers was excluded from the transaction price.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the timing of billings does not always match the timing of revenue recognition. when the company is entitled to bill a customer in advance of the recognition of revenue, a contract liability is recognized. when the company is not entitled to bill a customer until a period after the related recognition of revenue, a contract asset is recognized. contract assets represent the company's right to consideration for the exchange of goods under a contract, but which are not yet billable to a customer for consignment inventory or pursuant to certain shipping terms. contract liabilities were not material as of january 1, 2018 or december 31, 2018 . contract assets were $42
million as of january 1, 2018 and $62 million as of december 31, 2018 and are included as a component of
"miscellaneous receivables" in the consolidated statements of financial position.
the economic factors that impact the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows vary between the company's business operating segments and the geographical regions in which they serve. for disaggregation of revenue by major product lines and regions for each business operating segment, see note 19, "segment information"
.

item 9.  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none.
item 9a.  controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures eastman maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including the chief executive officer ("ceo") and chief financial officer ("cfo"), of the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures. based on that evaluation, the ceo and cfo have concluded that as of december 31, 2018 , the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed was accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives.
management, including the ceo and cfo, does not expect that the company's disclosure controls and procedures can prevent all possible errors or fraud. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance; judgments in decision-making can be faulty; and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of one or more persons. the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and while the company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to possible errors or fraud may occur and not be detected.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the company's ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
the company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:
•  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and acquisitions and dispositions of assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
•  statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the company; and
•  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the company's financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
122
management has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018
based on the framework established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this assessment, management has determined that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2018 .
the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there has been no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially effect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations legislative or regulatory actions could increase the company's future compliance costs.
eastman and its facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, both in the u.s. and internationally, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. the company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. for example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number of and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. specifically, future changes in u.s. federal legislation and regulation may increase the likelihood that the company's manufacturing facilities will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy, which legislation and regulation, if enacted, may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs.
significant acquisitions expose the company to risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.
while acquisitions have been and continue to be a part of eastman's growth strategy, acquisitions of large companies (such as the previous acquisitions of taminco corporation and solutia) subject the company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on eastman. these include, but are not limited to, the possibilities that the financial performance of the acquired business may be significantly worse than expected; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other "synergies" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the new business resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the company's existing businesses; and that the company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business into eastman or that the integration efforts will not achieve the expected benefits.
in addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. the foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. this disclosure, including that under "outlook"
and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the company in this annual report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. the company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. investors are advised, however, to consult any further public company disclosures (such as in filings with the securities and exchange commission or in company press releases) on related subjects.

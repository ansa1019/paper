item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider each of the risks described below relating to alliant energy, ipl and wpl, together with all of the other information contained in this combined report, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. if any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.
our utility business is significantly impacted by government legislation, regulation and oversight - our utility financial condition is influenced by how regulatory authorities, including the iub, the pscw and ferc, establish the rates we can charge our customers, our authorized rates of return and common equity levels, and the costs that may be recovered from customers. our ability to timely obtain rate adjustments to earn authorized rates of return depends upon timely regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and cannot be guaranteed. in future rate reviews, ipl and wpl may not receive an adequate amount of rate relief to recover all costs and earn their authorized rates of return, rates may be reduced, rate refunds may be required, rate adjustments may not be approved on a timely basis, costs may not be otherwise recovered through rates, future rates may be temporarily frozen, certain rate base items may not receive a full weighted average cost of capital, and authorized rates of return on capital may be reduced. as a result, we may experience adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, our operations are subject to extensive regulation primarily by the iub, the pscw and ferc. we are also subject to oversight and monitoring by organizations such as the north american electric reliability corporation, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration, and the midcontinent independent system operator, inc. the impacts on our operations include: our ability to site and construct new generating facilities and recover associated costs, such as renewable energy projects; the installation of environmental controls and the recovery of associated costs; our ability to decommission generating facilities and recover related costs and the remaining carrying value of these facilities; our ability to site, construct and recover costs for new natural gas pipelines; our ability to recover costs to upgrade our electric and gas distribution systems; the amount of certain sources of energy we must use, such as renewable sources; our ability to purchase generating facilities and recover the costs associated therewith; our ability to sell utility assets and any conditions placed upon the sale of such assets; the rates paid to transmission operators and how those costs are recovered from customers; our ability to enter into purchased power agreements and recover the costs associated therewith; resource adequacy requirements, energy capacity standards, what forms of energy are considered when determining whether we meet those standards, and when new facilities such as ipl's marshalltown generating station, wpl's west riverside energy center, and ipl's and wpl's planned additional wind generation may be fully accredited with energy capacity; the allocation of expenditures by transmission companies on transmission network upgrades and our ability to recover costs associated therewith; reliability; safety; the issuance of securities; accounting matters; and transactions between affiliates. these regulatory authorities and organizations are also empowered to impose financial penalties and other sanctions, including requirements to implement new compliance programs. failure to obtain approvals for any of these matters in a timely manner, or receipt of approvals with uneconomical conditions, may cause us not to pursue the construction of such projects or to record an impairment of our assets and may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
provisions of the wisconsin utility holding company act limit our ability to invest in or grow our non-utility activities and may deter potential purchasers who might be willing to pay a premium for our stock.
our strategy includes large construction projects, which are subject to risks - our strategy includes constructing renewable generating facilities, constructing a natural gas-fired generating facility, making other large-scale improvements to generating facilities, implementing advanced metering infrastructure for ipl customers, and large-scale additions and upgrades to our electric and gas distribution systems. these construction projects are subject to various risks. these risks include: the inability to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner; adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions; changes in applicable laws or regulations; changes in costs of materials, equipment, commodities, fuel or labor; delays caused by construction accidents or injuries; shortages in materials, equipment and qualified labor; changes to the scope or timing of the projects; general contractors or subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts; the inability to agree to contract terms or disputes in contract terms; poor initial cost estimates; work stoppages; adverse weather conditions; government actions; legal action; unforeseen engineering or technology issues; limited access to capital; and other adverse economic conditions. we may not be able to recover all costs for the projects in rates and face increased risk of potential impairment of our project investment if a construction project is not completed or is delayed, or final costs exceed expectations or the costs approved by our regulators, for example, if ipl's expansion of wind generation exceeds the respective cost cap approved by the iub. inability to recover costs, or inability to complete the project in a timely manner, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

demand for energy may decrease - our results of operations are affected by the demand for energy in our service territories. energy demand may decrease due to many things, including economic conditions, proliferation of customer- and third party-owned generation, loss of service territory or franchises, energy efficiency measures, technological advances that increase energy efficiency, and loss of wholesale customers. the loss of sales due to lower demand for energy may increase our rates for remaining customers, as our rates must cover our fixed costs. increased customer rates may cause decreased demand for energy as customers move to customer- and third party-owned generation and implement energy efficiency measures to reduce costs. the loss of customers, the inability to replace those customers with new customers, and the decrease in demand for energy could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
changes to certain tax elections, tax regulations and future taxable income could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations - we have significantly reduced our federal and state income tax obligations through tax planning strategies and the extension of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property. these tax planning strategies and extensions of bonus depreciation deductions have generated large annual taxable losses and tax credits that have resulted in significant federal and state net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. we plan to utilize substantially all of these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the future to reduce our income tax obligations. if we cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before they expire due to lower than expected financial performance or changes to tax regulations, we may incur material charges to earnings. if the irs does not agree with the deductions resulting from our tax planning strategies or our position on the qualification of production tax credits from wind generating facilities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
our utility business currently operates wind generating facilities, which generate production tax credits for us to use to reduce our federal tax obligations. the amount of production tax credits we earn is dependent on the level of electricity output generated by our wind farms and the applicable tax credit rate. a variety of operating and economic parameters, including significant transmission constraints, the imbalance of supply and demand of wind energy resulting in unfavorable pricing for wind energy, adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment, could significantly reduce the production tax credits generated by our wind farms resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
finally, ferc regulates utility income tax policies, including partnership tax policies, which impact our interest in american transmission company llc and atc holdco llc (atc holdings). ferc is currently investigating these income tax issues in addition to rate of return policies as a result of a court decision. the results of this investigation may lead to changes in ferc's income tax policies, which would impact partnership entities, particularly atc holdings. we are currently unable to determine what impacts these potential changes will have on our financial condition or results of operations; however, it is possible that a change could reduce alliant energy's equity earnings and distributions from atc holdings.
a cyber attack may disrupt our operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability - we operate in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. we face threats from use of malicious code (such as malware, viruses and ransomware), employee theft or misuse, advanced persistent threats, and phishing attacks. cyber attacks targeting electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations. any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches. due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber security, our current safeguards to protect our operating systems and information technology assets may not always be effective. we cannot guarantee that such safeguards will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack. if the technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer virus, and not be recovered in a timely fashion, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and confidential data could be compromised, adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operation.
in addition, we may collect and retain sensitive information, including personal information about our customers, shareowners and employees. in some cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. for example, we outsource administration of our employee health insurance to anthem. anthem was the target of a cyber attack in 2014. any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.
15
we are subject to employee workforce factors that could affect our businesses - we operate in an industry that requires specialized technical skills. it may be difficult to hire and retain such a skilled workforce due to labor market conditions, the length of time employees need to acquire the skills, and general competition for talent. further, we must build a work force that is innovative, customer-focused and competitive to thrive in the future in order to successfully implement our strategy. we are also subject to collective bargaining agreements with approximately 2,200 employees. any work stoppage experienced in connection with negotiations of collective bargaining agreements could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to implement our strategy.
our utility business is seasonal and may be adversely affected by the impacts of weather - electric and gas utility businesses are seasonal businesses. demand for electricity is greater in the summer months associated with higher air conditioning needs. conversely, demand for natural gas depends significantly upon temperature patterns in winter months due to heavy use in residential and commercial heating. as a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. in addition, we have historically generated less revenues and income when temperatures are warmer in the winter and/or cooler in the summer. thus, mild winters and/or summers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our utility businesses are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations - our utilities are subject to numerous stringent federal, regional, state and local environmental laws, regulations, court orders, and international treaties. these laws, regulations and court orders generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, disposal of coal combustion residuals, hazardous waste disposal, threatened and endangered species, and noise regulation, among others. failure to comply with such laws, regulations and court orders, or to obtain or comply with any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations, could result in injunctions, fines or other sanctions. environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and subject to continued uncertainty, but have tended to become more stringent over time. these laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our generating facilities. we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. changes in, or new development of, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers. failure to comply with the laws, regulations and court orders, changes in the laws and regulations and failure to recover costs of compliance may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
actions related to global climate change and reducing greenhouse gases (ghg) emissions could negatively impact us - regulators, customers and investors continue to raise concerns about climate change and ghg emissions. national regulatory action is in flux and international regulatory actions continue to evolve. we are focused on executing a long-term strategy to deliver reliable and affordable energy with lower carbon dioxide (co2) emissions independent of changing policies and political landscape. however, it is unclear how these climate change concerns will ultimately impact us. we could incur costs or other obligations to comply with future ghg regulations, and could become the target of legal claims or challenges, because generating electricity using fossil fuels emits co2 and other ghg. further, investors may determine that we are too reliant on fossil fuels and not buy shares of our common stock, or sell their shares of our common stock, which may cause our stock price to decrease, or not buy our debt securities, which may cause our cost of debt to increase. we could face additional pressures from customers or investors to more rapidly reduce co2 on a voluntary-basis, including faster adoption of lower carbon technologies and management of excess renewable energy credits. the epa's approach and timing for implementing rules to regulate carbon emissions at fossil-fueled electric generating units remains undecided and subject to litigation. regulation of co2 emissions could materially increase costs, causing some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. we cannot provide any assurance regarding the potential impacts of climate change policy or ghg regulations on our operations and these could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
we are dependent on the capital markets and could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the capital markets - successful implementation of our strategy is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets. we have forecasted capital expenditures of approximately $5 billion over the next four years. disruption, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets could increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to raise funds needed to operate our businesses. disruptions could be caused by federal reserve policies and actions, currency concerns, economic downturn or uncertainty, monetary policies, a negative view of the utility industry or our company, failures of financial institutions, u.s. debt management concerns, u.s. debt limit and budget debates, including government shutdowns, european and worldwide sovereign debt concerns, other global or geopolitical events, or other factors. increases in interest rates may cause the price of our equity securities to decline. any disruptions in capital markets could adversely impact our ability to implement our strategy.
16
we rely on our strong credit ratings to access the credit markets. if our credit ratings are downgraded for any reason, such as federal tax reform impacts or general negative outlook for the utility industry, we could pay higher interest rates in future financings, the pool of potential lenders could be reduced, borrowing costs under existing credit facilities could increase, our access to the commercial paper market could be limited, or we could be required to provide additional credit assurance, including cash collateral, to contract counterparties. if our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, volatility of the capital markets or other factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
regional and national economic conditions could have an unfavorable impact on us - our utility and non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve and credit risk of counterparties we do business with. adverse economic conditions in our service territories can adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and reduce their demand for electricity and natural gas. economic conditions may not create enough growth to replace lost energy demand or to grow energy demand. reduced volumes of electricity and natural gas sold, or the inability to collect unpaid bills from our customers, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism may impact our operations in unpredictable ways - we are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities. generation, transmission and distribution facilities, in general, have been identified as potential targets of physical or cyber attacks. physical attacks on transmission and distribution facilities that appeared to be terrorist-style attacks have occurred. the risks posed by such attacks could include, among other things, the inability to generate, purchase or distribute electric energy or obtain fuel sources, the increased cost of security and insurance, the disruption of, volatility in, or other effects on capital markets, and a decline in the economy and/or energy usage within our service territories, all of which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, the cost of repairing damage to our facilities and infrastructure caused by acts of terrorism, and the loss of revenue if such events prevent us from providing utility service to our customers, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we may not be able to fully recover costs related to commodity prices - we have natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for some of the natural gas and coal we require to generate electricity. we also have transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to our customers. our counterparties to these contracts may not fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to us due to financial or operational problems caused by natural disasters, severe weather or cyber attacks. if we were unable to obtain enough natural gas or coal for our electric generating facilities under our existing contracts, or to obtain electricity under existing or future purchased power agreements, we could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher-cost generating resources in the miso energy market. if, for natural gas delivery to our customers, we were unable to obtain our natural gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and transportation contracts, we could be required to purchase natural gas at higher prices from other sources. natural gas market prices have been volatile in the past, especially during periods of extremely cold temperatures or disruption in supply caused by major storms or pipeline explosions. we may not be able to pass on all of the changes in costs to our customers, especially at wpl where we do not have an automatic retail electric fuel cost adjustment clause to timely recover such costs. increases in prices and costs due to disruptions that are not recovered in rates fully, in a timely manner, may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we face risks associated with operating electric and natural gas infrastructure - the operation of electric generating facilities involves many risks, including start-up risks, breakdown or failure of equipment, failure of generating facilities including wind turbines, the dependence on a specific fuel source, including the supply and transportation of fuel, the risk of performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency, employee safety, operator error and compliance with mandatory reliability standards. our energy delivery infrastructure is aging, which increases certain risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment and fires developing from our power lines. in addition, the north american transmission grid is highly interconnected and, in extraordinary circumstances, disruptions at particular points within the grid could cause an extensive power outage in our delivery systems. increased utilization of customer- and third party-owned generation technologies could disrupt the reliability and balance of the electricity grid. further, the transmission system in our utilities' service territories can experience constraints limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within our service territories. the transmission constraints could result in an inability to deliver energy from generating facilities, particularly wind generating facilities, to the national grid, or to access lower cost sources of electric energy. we also have obligations to provide electric service under regulatory requirements and contractual commitments. failure to meet our service obligations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
17
the operation of our gas transmission and distribution infrastructure also involves many risks, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems and employee and public safety, which could cause substantial financial losses. these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental emissions, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. we are also responsible for compliance with new and changing mandatory reliability and safety standards, including anticipated new regulations under the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration. our infrastructure is aging, which could impact safety and compliance with possible new regulations. failure to meet these standards could result in substantial fines. we also have obligations to provide service under regulatory requirements and contractual commitments. failure to meet our service obligations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
storms or other natural disasters may impact our operations in unpredictable ways - storms and other natural disasters, including events such as floods, tornadoes, blizzards, ice storms, extreme cold temperatures, fires, solar flares or pandemics may adversely impact our ability to generate, purchase or distribute electric energy and gas or obtain fuel or other critical supplies. in addition, we could incur large costs to repair damage to our generating facilities and electric and gas infrastructure, or costs related to environmental remediation, due to storms or other natural disasters. the restoration costs may not be fully covered by insurance policies and may not be fully recovered in rates, or recovery in rates may be delayed. storms and natural disasters may impact our customers and the resulting reduced demand for energy could cause lower sales and revenues, which may not be replaced or recovered in rates, or rate recovery may be delayed. any of these items could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we may incur material post-closing adjustments related to past asset and business divestitures - we have sold certain non-utility subsidiaries such as whiting petroleum corporation (whiting petroleum), as well as regulated assets such as our minnesota electric and natural gas distribution assets. we may continue to incur liabilities relating to our previous ownership of, or the transactions pursuant to which we disposed of, these subsidiaries and assets. any potential liability depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including the financial condition of whiting petroleum and/or its assignees. any required payments on retained liabilities, guarantees or indemnification obligations with respect to whiting petroleum, the sales of our minnesota electric and natural gas distribution assets, or other future asset or business divestitures, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to limitations on our ability to pay dividends - alliant energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own. the primary sources of funds for alliant energy to pay dividends to its shareowners are dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries, primarily its utility subsidiaries. our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to us, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us and, accordingly, our ability to pay dividends on alliant energy common stock will depend on regulatory limitations, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements and general financial condition of our subsidiaries. our utilities have dividend payment restrictions based on the terms of any outstanding preferred stock and regulatory limitations applicable to them. if we do not receive adequate dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries, then we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce, dividend payments on alliant energy common stock.
our pension and other postretirement benefits plans are subject to investment and interest rate risk that could negatively impact our financial condition - we have pension and other postretirement benefits plans that provide benefits to many of our employees and retirees. costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the liabilities of the plans and market value of the assets that fund the plans. the funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, including economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics. recessions and volatility in the domestic and international financial markets have negatively affected the asset values of our pension plans at various times in the past. poor investment returns or lower interest rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
energy industry changes could have a negative effect on our businesses - we operate in a highly regulated business environment. the advent of new and unregulated markets has the potential to significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations. further, competitors may not be subject to the same operating, regulatory and financial requirements that we are, potentially causing a substantial competitive disadvantage for us. changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power, which could reduce the revenues or increase the expenses of our utility companies. increased competition in our primary retail electric service territories may have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
18
we face risks related to non-utility operations - we rely on our non-utility operations for a portion of our earnings. if our non-utility holdings do not perform at expected levels, we could experience a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this mda includes information relating to alliant energy, ipl and wpl, as well as aef and corporate services. where appropriate, information relating to a specific entity has been segregated and labeled as such. the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in this report. unless otherwise noted, all "per share" references in mda refer to earnings per diluted share.

utilities and corporate services - ipl and wpl own a portfolio of egus located in iowa, wisconsin and minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including natural gas, renewable resources and coal. the output from these egus, supplemented with purchased power, is used to provide electric service to approximately 965,000 electric customers in the upper midwest. the utility business also procures natural gas from various suppliers to provide service to approximately 415,000 retail gas customers in the upper midwest. alliant energy's utility business is its primary source of earnings and cash flows. the earnings and cash flows from the utilities and corporate services business are sensitive to various external factors including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of rates approved by regulatory authorities, the impact of weather and economic conditions on electric and gas sales volumes, and other factors listed in "risk factors" in item 1a and "forward-looking statements."
atc holdings - ati, a wholly-owned subsidiary of aef, holds all of alliant energy's interest in atc holdings.
non-utility business and parent - aef also manages various businesses including transportation (short-line railway and barge transportation services), a non-utility wind farm, the sheboygan falls energy facility and several other modest holdings.
strategic overview alliant energy's mission is to deliver energy solutions and exceptional service that its customers and communities count on - safely, efficiently and responsibly. our mission is supported by a strategy focused on meeting the evolving expectations of customers while providing an attractive return for investors. this strategy includes the following key elements:
providing affordable energy solutions to customers - alliant energy's strategy focuses on affordable energy solutions that support retention and growth of its existing customers and attract new customers to its service territories.
key highlights in 2018 (refer to "rate matters" for details) -
•   federal tax reform savings provided to retail electric and gas customers.
•   amendment to shorten the term of the daec nuclear ppa and the execution of four new wind ppas approved by the iub in december 2018.
•   rate settlement approved by the pscw in december 2018 authorizing electric and gas base rates for wpl retail customers to remain flat until 2020.
making customer-focused investments - alliant energy's strategy drives a capital allocation process focused on: 1) transitioning its generation portfolio to meet the growing interest of customers for cleaner sources of energy, 2) upgrading its electric and gas distribution systems to strengthen safety and resiliency, as well as enable distributed energy solutions in its service territories, and 3) enhancing its customers' experience with evolving technology and greater flexibility.
key highlights in 2018 (refer to "customer investments" for details) -
•   expansion of renewable generation with the required regulatory approvals and progress with construction of ipl's new wind projects located in iowa, as well as wpl's acquisition of fwec in april 2018.
•   expansion of natural gas-fired generation with the construction of wpl's west riverside facility.
•   completion of the remaining major environmental controls at ipl's and wpl's newer, larger and more efficient coal-fired generating units with the installation of an scr at wpl's columbia unit 2.
•   progress with implementing advanced metering infrastructure for ipl customers.
24
growing customer demand - alliant energy's strategy supports expanding electric and gas usage in its service territories by promoting electrification initiatives and economic development in the communities it serves.
key highlights in 2018 -
•   progress with certifying development-ready sites throughout iowa and wisconsin, including finalizing certification of the big cedar industrial center mega-site, a 1,300-acre rail-served ready-to-build manufacturing and industrial site in cedar rapids, iowa, which is in close proximity to the regional airport and interstate freeways and accesses ipl's electric services.
results of operations results of operations include financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as well as utility electric margins and utility gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under gaap. utility electric margins are defined as electric revenues less electric production fuel, purchased power and electric transmission service expenses. utility gas margins are defined as gas revenues less cost of gas sold. utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-gaap financial measures because they exclude other utility and non-utility revenues, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and taxes other than income tax expense.
management believes that utility electric and gas margins provide a meaningful basis for evaluating and managing utility operations since electric production fuel, purchased power and electric transmission service expenses and cost of gas sold are generally passed through to customers, and therefore, result in changes to electric and gas revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses. the presentation of utility electric and gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance. these utility electric and gas margins may not be comparable to how other entities define utility electric and gas margin. furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance.
additionally, the table below includes eps from continuing operations for utilities and corporate services, atc holdings, and non-utility and parent, which are non-gaap financial measures. alliant energy believes these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about alliant energy's operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.
financial results overview - alliant energy's net income and eps attributable to alliant energy common shareowners were as follows (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
2018                                                                                                              2017

income from discontinued operations             -                     -                   1.4                    -
net income                                 $512.1                 $2.19                $457.3                $1.99
alliant energy's utilities and corporate services income from continuing operations increased $69 million in 2018 compared to 2017. the increase was primarily due to higher margins resulting from ipl's and wpl's increasing rate base, higher retail electric and gas sales due to temperatures in 2018 compared to 2017, and higher afudc. these items were partially offset by higher depreciation expense.

(a)   the december 2016 pscw order for wpl's 2017/2018 test period electric and gas base rate review authorized changes in electric transmission cost recovery amortizations for 2018.
(b)   wpl estimates the increase (decrease) to electric margins from amounts within the approved bandwidth of plus or minus 2% of forecasted fuel-related expenses determined by the pscw each year was approximately $6 million, ($6) million and $6 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
(c)   changes in electric energy efficiency revenues were mostly offset by changes in energy efficiency expense included in other operation and maintenance expenses.
electric sales trends - alliant energy's retail electric sales volumes increased 2% in 2018 and decreased 1% in 2017 primarily due to the impact of changes in temperatures in its service territories on demand from residential and commercial customers. the 2017 decrease was also caused by an extra day of retail sales during 2016 due to the leap year, partially offset by increases in wpl's industrial sales from higher customer production and customer expansions.

other future considerations - in addition to items discussed in mda, the notes in item 8 and "risk factors" in item 1a, the following key items could impact alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's future financial condition or results of operations:
•   financing plans - alliant energy currently expects to issue up to $400 million of common stock in 2019 through the equity forward agreements that were executed in december 2018 and the shareowner direct plan. ipl and wpl currently expect to issue up to $600 million and $400 million of long-term debt securities in 2019, respectively. wpl has $250 million of long-term debt maturing in july 2019.
•   common stock dividends - alliant energy announced a 6% increase in its targeted 2019 annual common stock dividend to $1.42 per share, which is equivalent to a quarterly rate of $0.355 per share, beginning with the february 2019 dividend payment. the timing and amount of future dividends is subject to an approved dividend declaration from alliant energy's board of directors, and is dependent upon earnings expectations, capital requirements, and general financial business conditions, among other factors.
•   utility electric and gas margins - alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently expect an increase in electric and gas margins in 2019 compared to 2018 from earnings on increasing rate base for wpl's retail electric and gas rate review (2019/2020 test period) and interim rates for ipl's planned retail rate review. refer to "rate matters" for further discussion on these rate reviews.
•   depreciation and amortization expenses - alliant energy, ipl and wpl currently expect an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 due to property additions, including ipl's expansion of wind generation and wpl's west riverside natural gas-fired egu.
•   interest expense - alliant energy currently expects interest expense to increase in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to financings completed in 2018 and planned in 2019 as discussed above.
customer investments alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's strategic priorities include making significant customer-focused investments toward cleaner energy and sustainable customer solutions. these priorities include:
natural gas-fired generation wpl's construction of west riverside natural gas-fired generating station - in 2016, wpl received an order from the pscw authorizing wpl to construct an approximate 730 mw natural gas-fired combined-cycle egu in beloit, wisconsin, referred to as west riverside. wpl's construction of west riverside began in 2016 and the egu is currently expected to be completed by the end of 2019. wpl's estimated portion of capital expenditures is currently expected to be approximately $640 million. the capital expenditures include costs to construct the egu and a pipeline to supply natural gas to the egu, and exclude transmission network upgrades and afudc. estimated capital expenditures for west riverside for 2019 and 2020 are included in the "west riverside" line in the construction and acquisition expenditures table in "liquidity and capital resources." west riverside will replace energy and capacity being eliminated with the retirements of various egus.
30
wpl entered into agreements with neighboring utilities and electric cooperatives that provide each of them options to purchase a partial ownership interest in west riverside. the purchase price for such options is based on the ownership interest acquired and the net book value of west riverside on the date of the purchase. the exercise of the wpsc and mge options is subject to pscw approval, and the timing and ownership amounts of the options are as follows:
counterparty                                  option amount                                                              option timing wisconsin public service corporation (wpsc)   up to 200 mw (no more than 100 mw to be acquired in first two years) (a)   2019-2023 (b)
madison gas and electric company (mge)        up to 50 mw (no more than 25 mw to be acquired in first two years)         2019-2024 (b)
electric cooperatives                         approximately 60 mw                                                        exercised january 2018
(a)   if wpsc exercises its options, wpl may exercise reciprocal options, subject to approval by the pscw, to purchase up to 200 mw of any natural-gas combined-cycle egu that either wpsc or its affiliated utility, wisconsin electric power company, places in service within 10 years of the date west riverside is placed in service.
(b)   assumes an in-service date by the end of 2019.
wpsc and mge options - in conjunction with the agreements wpl entered into with wpsc and mge associated with west riverside, wpl also entered into amendments to the columbia joint operating agreement. in 2016, wpl received an order from the pscw approving amendments to the columbia joint operating agreement, which allow wpsc and mge to forgo certain capital expenditures at columbia. based on the additional capital expenditures wpl currently expects to incur through june 1, 2020, wpl's ownership interest in columbia is expected to increase from 46.2% (as of december 31, 2016) to 53.4%.
wind generation alliant energy's cleaner energy strategy includes the planned development and acquisition of up to 1,200 mw of wind generation in aggregate (up to 1,000 mw at ipl and up to 200 mw at wpl) during 2018 through 2020. ipl and wpl believe their respective planned development of wind generation will qualify for the full level of production tax credits as a result of progress payments in 2016 for wind turbines, and plan to place these wind projects into service by the end of 2020. estimated capital expenditures for the planned wind generation projects for 2019 through 2022 are included in the "renewable projects" line in the construction and acquisition expenditures table in "liquidity and capital resources." alliant energy, ipl and wpl continue to evaluate additional opportunities to add more wind generation after 2021. renewables are currently targeted to be approximately 30% of alliant energy's overall energy mix by 2030.
ipl's expansion of wind generation - in april 2018, ipl received approval from the iub for advance rate-making principles for up to 500 mw of new wind generation, which is in addition to the 500 mw of new wind generation approved by the iub in october 2016. the advance rate-making principles approved by the iub in 2016 and 2018 were as follows:
•   additional wind generation that qualifies for the full level of production tax credits, as long as the projects are located in iowa. the 2016 and 2018 iub decisions have cost caps of $1,830/kilowatt and $1,780/kilowatt, respectively, including afudc and transmission costs. any costs incurred in excess of the respective cost caps are expected to be incorporated into rates if determined to be reasonable and prudent.
•   a depreciable life of the wind generation facilities of 40 years, unless changed as a result of a contested case before the iub.
•   an 11.0% return on common equity, with the exception of certain transmission facilities classified as intangible assets, which would earn the rate of return on common equity the iub finds reasonable in each future retail electric rate proceeding.
•   the 2016 iub decision includes a return on common equity for the calculation of afudc during the construction period that is the greater of 10.0% or whatever percentage the iub finds reasonable during ipl's most recent retail electric rate proceeding. the 2018 iub decision includes a 9.6% return on common equity for the calculation of afudc during the construction period.
•   the application of double leverage is deferred until a future retail electric rate proceeding.
•   amortization over a 10-year period of ipl's prudently incurred and unreimbursed costs, effective with a future retail electric base rate proceeding, if ipl cancels the construction of the wind generation facilities.

refer to note 3 for discussion of wpl's april 2018 acquisition of 55 mw of the fwec wind farm.
coal-fired generation environmental controls projects - alliant energy's strategy to transition its generation portfolio to cleaner sources of energy includes adding environmental controls at newer, larger and more efficient coal-fired egus to continue producing affordable energy for customers and to benefit the environment. so2 and nox emissions from alliant energy's generating fleet are targeted to be reduced by approximately 90% and 80%, respectively, from 2005 levels by 2020. in 2018, wpl completed the installation of an scr at columbia unit 2. in addition, ipl expects to complete the installation of an scr at ottumwa unit 1 in 2019 to achieve compliance obligations under the cross-state air pollution rule and ipl's consent decree. ipl's portion of capital expenditures (past and future) for the scr is expected to be $60 million to $70 million.
plant retirements and fuel switching - in 2018, ipl retired red cedar combustion turbine unit 1 and m.l. kapp unit 2, and wpl retired edgewater unit 4. the current strategy includes the retirement, or fuel switch from coal to natural gas, of additional older, smaller and less efficient egus in the next several years. coal-fired egus are targeted to be eliminated from alliant energy's overall energy mix by 2050. alliant energy, ipl and wpl are working with miso, state regulatory commissions and other regulatory agencies, as required, to determine the timing of these actions, which are subject to change depending on operational, regulatory, market and other factors. refer to note 17(e) for discussion of ipl's requirements to fuel switch or retire certain egus under a consent decree.
other customer-focused investments electric and gas distribution systems - customer-focused investments include replacing, modernizing and upgrading infrastructure in the electric and gas distribution systems. electric system investments will focus on areas such as improving resiliency with more underground electric distribution and enabling distributed energy solutions with higher capacity lines. gas system investments will focus on pipeline replacement to ensure safety and pipeline expansion to support reliability and economic development. estimated capital expenditures for expected and current electric and gas distribution infrastructure projects for 2019 through 2022 are included in the "electric and gas distribution systems" lines in the construction and acquisition expenditures table in "liquidity and capital resources."
gas pipeline expansion - ipl and wpl currently expect to make investments to extend various gas distribution systems to provide natural gas to unserved or underserved areas in their service territories.
advanced metering infrastructure (ami) - ipl is currently installing ami in its electric and gas service territories in iowa through a phased approach, which is expected to be completed in 2019. ami is a system of meters, communications networks and data management systems that enables two-way communication between utilities and its customers. ami allows for remote meter reading, automatic outage notification, and remote disconnects and reconnects. ami technology is expected to enhance the communication infrastructure in alliant energy's service territories, improve customer service, enhance energy management initiatives and provide operational savings through increased efficiencies.
non-utility business - alliant energy continues to explore limited scope opportunities for growth outside of, but related to, alliant energy's utility business. this non-utility strategy continues to evolve through exploration of modest opportunities that are accretive to earnings and cash flows within and outside of alliant energy's service territories.

rate matters rate reviews retail base rate filings - base rate changes reflect both returns on additions to infrastructure and recovery of changes in costs incurred or expected to be incurred. given that a portion of the rate changes will offset changes in costs, revenues from rate changes should not be expected to result in an equal change in net income for either ipl or wpl.
wpl's retail electric and gas rate review (2019/2020 test period) - in december 2018, wpl received an order from the pscw approving wpl's proposed settlement for its retail electric and gas rate review covering the 2019/2020 test period, effective january 1, 2019. under the settlement, wpl's retail electric and gas base rates will not change from current levels through the end of 2020. retail electric revenue requirements resulting from increasing investments in rate base (including west riverside) are offset by lower fuel-related costs and federal tax reform refunds. retail gas revenue requirements resulting from increasing investments in rate base are offset by federal tax reform refunds. wpl's settlement maintains the currently authorized return on common equity of 10.0% and extends, with certain modifications, an earnings sharing mechanism through 2020. under the earnings sharing mechanism, wpl will defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 10.25% during the 2019/2020 test period. wpl must defer 50% of its excess earnings between 10.25% and 10.75%, and 100% of any excess earnings above 10.75%. the fuel-related cost component of wpl's retail electric rates for 2020 will be addressed in a separate filing, which is currently expected to occur in 2019.
ipl's retail gas rate review (2017 test year) - in may 2018, ipl filed a request with the iub to increase annual gas base rates for its iowa retail gas customers by $20 million, or approximately 8%. the request was based on a 2017 historical test year as adjusted for certain known and measurable changes occurring up to 12 months after the commencement of the proceeding. the key drivers for the filing included recovery of capital projects, partially offset by the benefits of federal tax reform. an interim retail gas rate increase of $11 million, or approximately 5%, on an annual basis, was implemented effective may 14, 2018. in december 2018, the iub issued an order approving a unanimous settlement agreement between ipl and various parties, resulting in an annual retail gas base rate increase of $14 million, or approximately 6%, which replaced the interim rate increase effective january 17, 2019.
planned rate review - ipl currently expects to make retail rate filings in the first quarter of 2019 based on a forward-looking test period for electric and gas rates. ipl expects to concurrently file for interim electric rates based on historical data for 2018 and certain known and measurable changes occurring in the first quarter of 2019. those interim electric rates are expected to be effective by april 2019. the key drivers for the anticipated filings include recovery of capital projects, including new wind generation, and ongoing operational costs.

other rate matters federal tax reform - in january 2018, the iub issued an order requiring ipl and other investor-owned utilities in iowa to track all calculated differences since january 1, 2018 resulting from federal tax reform. in april 2018, the iub issued an order on ipl's electric and gas federal tax reform proposals. ipl estimates the calculated differences in 2018 were approximately $40 million, with $25 million returned to retail electric customers in 2018 and the remaining $15 million expected to be returned in 2019. in addition, the iub order determined the excess deferred taxes resulting from the remeasurement of accumulated deferred income taxes caused by federal tax reform (approximately $350 million revenue requirement) will be addressed in ipl's current and future retail electric and gas rate reviews.
in january 2018, the pscw issued an order directing wpl and other investor-owned utilities in wisconsin to defer the revenue requirement impacts since january 1, 2018 resulting from federal tax reform. in may 2018, the pscw issued an order directing wpl to return annual tax benefits for 2018 to wpl's retail electric and gas customers. in 2018, $41 million of tax benefits were returned to wpl's retail electric and gas customers. excess deferred taxes resulting from the remeasurement of accumulated deferred income taxes caused by federal tax reform result in an approximate $460 million revenue requirement impact for wpl. approximately $85 million of this amount will be used to help maintain base rates from current levels through 2020, and the remainder will be addressed in wpl's future retail electric and gas rate reviews.
in march 2018, ferc issued an order granting a waiver request filed in february 2018 by a group of miso transmission owners, including itc and atc, allowing transmission rates to be updated to reflect the impacts resulting from federal tax reform. as a result, beginning in march 2018, amounts billed by itc and atc decreased due to the impacts from federal tax reform. ipl began providing the benefits of the lower transmission service expense to its electric customers utilizing the transmission cost recovery mechanism effective may 1, 2018. wpl will defer any incremental benefits of the lower transmission service expense from federal tax reform until a future electric rate review. based on ipl's and wpl's electric transmission cost recovery mechanisms, ipl and wpl currently do not expect that any changes to electric transmission service costs billed by itc and atc, respectively, will have a material impact on their financial condition and results of operations.
iowa tax reform - refer to note 2 for discussion of future changes to the iowa state income tax rate due to iowa tax reform enacted in may 2018 and the resulting impact on alliant energy's and ipl's financial statements.
ipl's duane arnold energy center purchased power agreement amendment - in 2012, ipl entered into a nuclear generation ppa for the purchase of approximately 430 mw of capacity and the resulting energy from daec for a term from february 2014 through december 2025. in july 2018, ipl entered into a proposed amendment to shorten the term of the daec ppa by five years in exchange for a $110 million buyout payment by ipl in september 2020, which would change alliant energy's and ipl's future commitments related to the daec ppa. to replace some of the energy and capacity from daec, ipl entered into four new ppas with expected 20-year terms beginning in 2020 and 2021 for the purchase of approximately 340 mw of energy in aggregate from existing iowa wind farms that are expected to be repowered. the amendment to shorten the term of the daec ppa and the four new wind ppas are expected to provide significant energy cost savings to ipl customers. in december 2018, the iub issued an order, effective in january 2019, approving the settlement agreement and the recovery of the buyout payment from ipl's retail customers over a five-year period following the payment in 2020 at ipl's pre-tax weighted-average cost of capital in effect at the time recovery commences.
liquidity and capital resources overview - alliant energy, ipl and wpl expect to maintain adequate liquidity to operate their businesses and implement their strategy as a result of operating cash flows generated by their utility business, and available capacity under a single revolving credit facility and ipl's sales of accounts receivable program, supplemented by periodic issuances of long-term debt and alliant energy equity securities.
liquidity position - at december 31, 2018, alliant energy had $21 million of cash and cash equivalents, $559 million ($114 million at the parent company, $200 million at ipl and $245 million at wpl) of available capacity under the single revolving credit facility and no available capacity at ipl under its sales of accounts receivable program.
capital structure - alliant energy, ipl and wpl plan to maintain debt-to-total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment-grade credit ratings. ipl and wpl expect to maintain capital structures consistent with their authorized levels. alliant energy expects to maintain consolidated debt at approximately 55% of total capital and consolidated preferred stock at less than 5% of total capital. these targets may be adjusted depending on subsequent developments and the impact on their respective weighted-average cost of capital and investment-grade credit ratings. capital structures as of december 31,
34
2018 were as follows (common equity (ce); ipl's preferred stock (ps); long-term debt (including current maturities) (ld); short-term debt (sd)):
alliant energy, ipl and wpl intend to manage their capital structures and liquidity positions in such a way that facilitates their ability to raise funds reliably and on reasonable terms and conditions, while maintaining capital structures consistent with those approved by regulators. in addition to capital structures, other important factors used to determine the characteristics of future financings include financial coverage ratios, capital spending plans, regulatory orders and rate-making considerations, levels of debt imputed by rating agencies, market conditions, the impact of tax initiatives and legislation, and anticipated proceeds from asset sales. the pscw factors certain imputed debt adjustments in establishing a regulatory capital structure as part of wpl's retail rate reviews. the iub does not make any explicit adjustments for imputed debt in establishing capital ratios used in determining customer rates, although such adjustments are considered by ipl in recommending an appropriate capital structure. debt imputations by rating agencies include pension and opeb obligations and the sales of accounts receivable program.
credit and capital markets - alliant energy, ipl and wpl maintain a single revolving credit facility to provide backstop liquidity to their commercial paper programs, and ensure a committed source of liquidity in the event the commercial paper market becomes disrupted. in addition, ipl maintains a sales of accounts receivable program as an alternative financing source.
primary sources and uses of cash - alliant energy's most significant source of cash is from electric and gas sales to ipl's and wpl's customers. cash from these sales reimburses ipl and wpl for prudently-incurred expenses to provide service to their utility customers and provides ipl and wpl a return of and a return on the assets used to provide such services. capital needed to retire debt and fund capital expenditures related to large strategic projects is expected to be met primarily through external financings.

construction and acquisition expenditures - construction and acquisition expenditures and financing plans are reviewed, approved and updated as part of the financial planning process. changes may result from a number of reasons, including regulatory requirements, changing legislation, not obtaining favorable and acceptable regulatory approval on certain projects, improvements in technology, improvements to ensure reliability of the electric and gas distribution systems, and new opportunities. alliant energy, ipl and wpl have not yet entered into contractual commitments relating to the majority of their anticipated future construction and acquisition expenditures. as a result, they have some discretion with regard to the level and timing of these expenditures. the table below summarizes anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures (in millions). cost estimates represent alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's portion of construction expenditures and exclude afudc and capitalized interest, if applicable. such estimates reflect reductions to alliant energy's and wpl's capital expenditures resulting from purchase options by certain electric cooperatives for a partial ownership interest in west riverside. such amounts do not include ipl's expected $110 million buyout payment in september 2020 related to the daec ppa, nor any potential proceeds if wpsc and/or mge exercise options for a partial ownership interest in west riverside. refer to "customer investments" for further discussion of certain key projects impacting construction and acquisition plans related to the utility business.

the credit agreement contains provisions that prohibit placing liens on any of the property of alliant energy, ipl or wpl or their respective subsidiaries with certain exceptions. exceptions include among others, liens to secure obligations of up to 10% of the consolidated tangible assets of the applicable borrower (valued at carrying value), liens imposed by government entities, materialmen's and similar liens, judgment liens, liens to secure additional non-recourse debt not to exceed $100 million outstanding at any one time at each of alliant energy, ipl and wpl, and purchase money liens.

the credit agreement contains customary events of default, including a cross-default provision that would be triggered if alliant energy or certain of its significant subsidiaries (including ipl and wpl) defaults on debt (other than non-recourse debt) totaling $100 million or more. ipl and wpl are subject to a similar cross-default provision with respect to their own respective consolidated debt. a default by alliant energy or its non-utility subsidiaries would not trigger a cross-default at ipl or wpl, nor would a default by either of ipl or wpl constitute a cross-default event for the other. if an event of default under the credit agreement occurs and is continuing, then the lenders may declare any outstanding obligations of the defaulting borrower under the credit agreement immediately due and payable. in addition, if any order for relief is entered under bankruptcy laws with respect to (a) alliant energy, ipl or wpl, then any outstanding obligations of alliant energy under the credit agreement would be immediately due and payable, or (b) ipl or wpl, then any outstanding obligations of ipl or wpl, respectively, under the credit agreement would be immediately due and payable.
a material adverse change representation is not required for borrowings under the credit agreement. at december 31, 2018, alliant energy, ipl and wpl were in compliance with financial covenants of the credit agreement. refer to note 9(a) for additional information regarding short-term debt.

impact of credit ratings on liquidity and collateral obligations -
ratings triggers - the long-term debt of alliant energy and its subsidiaries is not subject to any repayment requirements as a result of explicit credit rating downgrades or so-called "ratings triggers." however, alliant energy and its subsidiaries are parties to various agreements that contain provisions dependent on credit ratings. in the event of a significant downgrade, alliant energy or its subsidiaries may need to provide credit support, such as letters of credit or cash collateral equal to the amount of the exposure, or may need to unwind the contract or pay the underlying obligation. in the event of a significant downgrade, management believes alliant energy, ipl and wpl have sufficient liquidity to cover counterparty credit support
39
or collateral requirements under these various agreements. in addition, a downgrade in the credit ratings of alliant energy, ipl or wpl, could also result in them paying higher interest rates in future financings, reduce flexibility with future financing plans, reduce their pool of potential lenders, increase their borrowing costs under existing credit facilities or limit their access to the commercial paper market. credit ratings and outlooks as of the date of this report are as follows:

off-balance sheet arrangements -
special purpose entities - ipl maintains a receivables agreement whereby it may sell its customer accounts receivables, unbilled revenues and certain other accounts receivables to a third party through wholly-owned and consolidated special purpose entities. in march 2018, ipl amended and extended through march 2021 the purchase commitment from the third party to which it sells its receivables. in 2018, 2017 and 2016, ipl evaluated the third party that purchases ipl's receivable assets under the receivables agreement and believes that the third party is a vie. however, ipl concluded consolidation of the third party was not required.
in addition, ipl's sales of accounts receivable program agreement contains a cross-default provision that is triggered if ipl or alliant energy incurs an event of default on debt totaling $100 million or more. if an event of default under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program agreement occurs, then the counterparty could terminate such agreement. refer to note 5(b) for additional information regarding ipl's sales of accounts receivable program.
guarantees and indemnifications - at december 31, 2018, various guarantees and indemnifications are outstanding related to alliant energy's cash equity ownership interest in a non-utility wind farm and alliant energy's and ipl's prior divestiture activities. refer to note 17(d) for additional information.

at december 31, 2018, alliant energy, ipl and wpl had no uncertain tax positions recorded as liabilities. refer to note 13(a) for anticipated pension and opeb funding amounts, which are not included in the above tables. refer to "construction and acquisition expenditures" above for additional information on construction and acquisition programs. in addition, at december 31, 2018, there were various other liabilities included on the balance sheets that, due to the nature of the liabilities, the timing of payments cannot be estimated and are therefore excluded from the above tables.
other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions - primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices, investment prices and interest rates. risk management policies are used to monitor and assist in mitigating these market risks and derivative instruments are used to manage some of the exposures related to commodity prices. refer to notes 1(h) and 15 for further discussion of derivative instruments, and note 1(g) for details of utility cost recovery mechanisms that significantly reduce commodity risk.
commodity price - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of commodities they procure and market. established policies and procedures mitigate risks associated with these market fluctuations, including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various durations for the forward sale and purchase of these commodities. exposure to commodity price risks in the utility businesses is also significantly mitigated by current rate-making structures in place for recovery of fuel-related costs as well as the cost of natural gas purchased for resale. ipl's electric and gas tariffs and wpl's wholesale electric and gas tariffs provide for subsequent monthly adjustments to their tariff rates for material changes in prudently incurred commodity costs. ipl's and wpl's rate mechanisms, combined with commodity derivatives, significantly reduce commodity risk associated with their electric and gas margins. wpl's retail electric margins have modest exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices due largely to the current retail recovery mechanism in place in wisconsin for fuel-related costs.
investment price - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are exposed to investment price risk as a result of their investments in securities, largely related to securities held by their pension and opeb plans. refer to note 13(a) for details of the securities held by their pension and opeb plans. refer to "critical accounting policies and estimates" for the impact on retirement plan costs of changes in the rate of returns earned by plan assets.
interest rate - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates associated with variable-rate borrowings. in addition, alliant energy and ipl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates on cash amounts outstanding under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program. assuming the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates on variable-rate borrowings and cash proceeds outstanding under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program at december 31, 2018, alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's annual pre-tax expense would increase by approximately $8 million, $2 million and $1 million, respectively. refer to notes 5(b) and 9 for additional information on cash proceeds outstanding under ipl's sales of accounts receivable program, and short- and long-term variable-rate borrowings, respectively. refer to "critical accounting policies and estimates" for the impacts of changes in discount rates on retirement plan obligations and costs.

new accounting standards - refer to note 1(n) for discussion of new accounting standards impacting alliant energy, ipl and wpl.
critical accounting policies and estimates - the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to the business and the understanding of financial results as they require critical assumptions and judgments by management. the results of these assumptions and judgments form the basis for making estimates regarding the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual financial results may differ materially from these estimates. management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors. refer to note 1 for additional discussion of accounting policies and the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.
contingencies - assumptions and judgments are made each reporting period regarding the future outcome of contingent events. loss contingency amounts are recorded for any contingent events for which the likelihood of loss is probable and able to be reasonably estimated based upon current available information. the amounts recorded may differ from actuals when the uncertainty is resolved. the estimates made in accounting for contingencies, and the gains and losses that are recorded upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties, could have a significant effect on results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. note 17 provides further discussion of contingencies assessed at december 31, 2018, including various pending legal proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications that may have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations.
regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities - ipl and wpl are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies. as a result, they are subject to gaap for regulated operations, which recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability. regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap and actions imposed by the regulatory agencies in the rate-making process. regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred as such costs are probable of recovery in future customer rates. regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recognized in accordance with the rulings of applicable federal and state regulators, and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities.
assumptions and judgments are made each reporting period regarding whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and regulatory liabilities are probable future obligations by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes, rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies, historical decisions by such regulatory agencies regarding similar regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, and subsequent events of such regulatory agencies. the decisions made by regulatory authorities have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. a change in these decisions may result in a material impact on results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. note 2 provides details of the nature and amounts of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities assessed at december 31, 2018.
long-lived assets - periodic assessments regarding the recoverability of certain long-lived assets are completed when factors indicate the carrying value of such assets may be impaired or such assets are planned to be sold. these assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management. the long-lived assets assessed for impairment generally include certain assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from ipl's and wpl's customers as a result of regulatory decisions in the future, and assets within non-utility operations that are proposed to be sold or are currently generating operating losses.
regulated operations - certain long-lived assets within regulated operations are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate all or a portion of the carrying value of the assets may be disallowed for rate-making purposes. if ipl or wpl is disallowed recovery of any portion of the carrying value of its regulated property, plant and equipment that is under construction, has been recently completed or is probable of being retired early, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value that was disallowed recovery. if ipl or wpl is disallowed a full or partial return on the carrying value of its regulated property, plant and equipment that is under construction, has been recently completed or is probable of being retired early, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of the future revenues expected from its regulated property, plant and equipment. alliant energy's, ipl's and wpl's long-lived assets within their regulated operations that were assessed for impairment and plant abandonment in 2018 included ipl's and wpl's generating units subject to early retirement.

generating units subject to early retirement - alliant energy, ipl and wpl evaluate future plans for their electric generation fleet and have announced the early retirement of certain older and less-efficient egus. when it becomes probable that an egu will be retired before the end of its useful life, alliant energy, ipl and wpl must assess whether the egu meets the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment. egus that are considered probable of abandonment generally have material remaining net book values and are expected to cease operations in the near term significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. if an egu meets such criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, alliant energy, ipl and wpl must assess the probability of full recovery of the remaining carrying value of such egu. if it is probable that regulators will not allow full recovery of and a full return on the remaining net book value of the abandoned egu, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the remaining carrying value and the present value of the future revenues expected from the abandoned egu.
in june 2018, ipl retired m.l. kapp unit 2. ipl's current rates include a full recovery of and a full return on this egu from both its retail and wholesale customers, and as a result, alliant energy and ipl concluded that no impairment was required as of december 31, 2018. in september 2018, wpl retired edgewater unit 4. wpl is currently allowed a full recovery of and a full return on this egu from both its retail and wholesale customers, and as a result, alliant energy and wpl concluded that no impairment was required as of december 31, 2018. alliant energy, ipl and wpl evaluated their other egus that are subject to early retirement and determined that no other egus met the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment as of december 31, 2018.
unbilled revenues - unbilled revenues are primarily associated with utility operations. energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of customers' meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated at the end of each reporting period and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded. the unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes, estimated customer usage by class, temperature impacts, line losses and the most recent customer rates. such process involves the use of various judgments and assumptions and significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on results of operations. as of december 31, 2018, unbilled revenues related to alliant energy's utility operations were $171 million ($97 million at ipl and $74 million at wpl).
pensions and other postretirement benefits - alliant energy, ipl and wpl sponsor various defined benefit pension and opeb plans that provide benefits to a significant portion of their employees and retirees. assumptions and judgments are made periodically to estimate the obligations and costs related to their retirement plans. there are many judgments and assumptions involved in determining an entity's pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs each period including employee demographics (including life expectancies and compensation levels), discount rates, assumed rates of return and funding. changes made to plan provisions may also impact current and future benefits costs. judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed at least annually. the following table shows the impacts of changing certain key actuarial assumptions discussed above (in millions):

income taxes - alliant energy, ipl and wpl are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. assumptions and judgments are made each reporting period to estimate income tax assets, liabilities, benefits and expenses. judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections. significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations. alliant energy's and ipl's critical assumptions and judgments for 2018 include estimates of qualifying deductions for repairs expenditures and allocation of mixed service costs due to the impact of iowa rate-making principles on such property-related differences. critical assumptions and judgments also include projections of future taxable income used to determine the ability to utilize net

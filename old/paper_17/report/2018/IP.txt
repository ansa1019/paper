item 1a. risk factors the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance. the board of directors exercises oversight of the company's enterprise risk management program, which includes strategic, operational and financial matters, as well as compliance and legal risks. the audit and finance committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the board's standing committees and management, and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year.
in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (particularly in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations), or in the company's other filings with the securities and exchange commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.
risks relating to industry conditions changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy and transportation could affect our profitability. we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda and starch), energy sources (principally biomass, natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. the global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by trade policies between countries, individual governments' legislation and regulations, as well as changes in the global economy. in addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause occasional significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices. energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. the availability of labor and the market price for diesel fuel may affect our costs for third-party transportation. our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.
the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences. fluctuations in the prices of, and the demand for, our products could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. in addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our products. these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products. consequently, our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products.
competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results. we operate in a competitive environment, both in the united states and internationally, in all of our operating segments. product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, and marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results.
6
risks relating to market and economic factors adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations. general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. in addition, volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.
changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. specifically, russia, brazil, poland, india, and turkey, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world. fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the u.s. dollar, downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences or rulings, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results. trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. likewise, disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries (e.g., the u.s. and china) could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders. in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.
the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business. as of december 31, 2018, international paper had approximately $10.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:
•   it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;
•   a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;
•   the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;
•   our indebtedness that is subject to variable rates and, in the instance such variable rates use the london interbank offered rate (libor) as a benchmark, exposes us to a possible increase in debt service obligations in the event that the method for determining libor changes, libor is replaced by an alternative reference rate or libor is phased out altogether;
•   it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and
•   it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.
in addition, we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants. a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives.
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse
7
effect on the market price of our securities. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of the company's ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market, may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. the company's desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.
under the terms of the agreements governing approximately $1.4 billion of our debt as of december 31, 2018, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade. as a result, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense. there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. any such downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.
downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes. we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to temple-inland in connection with temple-inland's 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating. since 2007, certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, a number of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $538 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained. the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the company's consolidated financial statements. see note 14, variable interest entities, on pages 65 and 66, and note
12, income taxes, on pages 58 through 62, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all u.s. salaried employees hired prior to july 1, 2004 (or later for certain acquired populations, as described in note 18. retirement plans, on pages 70 through 77, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data) and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date. the company has frozen participation under these plans for u.s. salaried employees, including credited services and compensation on or after january 1, 2019; however, the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through december 31, 2018. we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former u.s. hourly employees, as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former u.s. salaried employees. our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods. likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs.
our pension plans are currently underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis, and over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans, reducing the cash available for our business. we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification (asc) 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," at december 31, 2018 was $1.8 billion. the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
risks relating to our operations material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results. we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting
8
customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:
•   fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;
•   the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;
•   the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities;
•   terrorism or threats of terrorism;
•   domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;
•   unscheduled maintenance outages;
•   prolonged power failures;
•   an equipment failure;
•   a chemical spill or release;
•   explosion of a boiler or other equipment;
•   damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;
•   disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;
•   widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis;
•   labor difficulties; and
•   other operational problems.
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.
certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit. certain operations in russia are carried on by a joint venture, ilim. in joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. in general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. in joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. in addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so we receive only our portion of those benefits.
we may not achieve the expected benefits from acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, capital investments and other corporate transactions. our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, capital investments and other corporate transactions and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions, and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits. among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper. in january 2018, for example, we completed a transaction transferring our north american consumer packaging business to graphic packaging in exchange for, among other things, an equity interest in the combined business of 20.5%. the success of the transaction and the value of our equity interest will depend on variables we do not control, such as the financial performance of the combined business and on the ability of the combined business to realize anticipated growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies.
we are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company, customer, employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes. our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to employee error or malfeasance, cyber attacks, or natural disasters. network, system, application and data
9
breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper. access to internal applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity, government enforcement and could have a material effect on our business.
risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways, and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations. our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. laws, regulations and other government requirements -- including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, tax, trade and health care. there can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs.
for example, we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements, including with global climate change laws and regulations, will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.
as another example, we are subject to a number of labor and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility. additionally, we are subject to complex and evolving u.s. and international privacy laws and regulations, including those pertaining to the handling of personal data, such as the general data protection regulation (gdpr). government authorities around the world are considering, or are in the process of implementing, new data protection regulations. many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application, interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties, increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses.
as a final example, the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities. additionally, administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent, and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain. while we believe the positions reported by the company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations, taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently. we are currently subject to tax audits in the u.s., brazil, poland, russia and other taxing jurisdictions around the world. in some cases, we have appealed and may continue to appeal, assessments by taxing authorities in the court system. as such, tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses, higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties.
results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty. although we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims will have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary full-year 2018 net earnings were $2.0 billion ($4.85 per diluted share) compared with net earnings of $2.1 billion ($5.13 per diluted share) for full-year 2017. full-year 2017 net earnings included a provisional net tax benefit of $1.2 billion ($2.93 per diluted share) related to the u.s. enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 reported as a special item.
international paper delivered strong earnings, returns and cash generation in 2018, driven by solid commercial and operational performance across our three businesses. business segment operating profit improved by approximately $800 million to $2.9 billion in 2018, driven primarily by price and mix improvements, with revenue growth of 7.2%. we continued to grow value for our shareholders with a return which was significantly above our cost of capital and marks our ninth consecutive year with value-creating returns. the company made strategic investments to strengthen our businesses. among these, we completed the final phase of our multi-year north american containerboard mill system optimization projects, which gives us the added flexibility we need around capacity, products and geographies. we also invested in our north american corrugated packaging system to enhance our capabilities and strengthen our position with the fastest growing segments. in our emea packaging business, we completed the conversion of the madrid, spain mill and started production of high-performance, lightweight recycled containerboard to capture the integrated margin with our emea box system. international paper continued to deliver strong cash generation in 2018, which we used to strengthen our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. we decreased balance sheet debt by about $500 million, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends of about $800 million and share repurchases of about $700 million. the company increased its dividend for the seventh consecutive year and reduced shares outstanding by 3%.
the company's 2018 results include significant price and mix improvements driven by price realization across our three business segments. improved mix contributed to the company's strong performance, particularly in our global cellulose fibers business where we continued to grow fluff pulp volume. weather events in north america and startup costs associated with the madrid, spain mill negatively impacted operations, and planned maintenance outages were higher. input costs increased in 2018, driven by higher wood fiber, chemicals, distribution and energy costs, and were partially offset by lower recovered fiber costs. equity earnings increased by $159 million to $336 million in 2018, driven by excellent commercial and operational performance in our ilim joint venture and first-year equity earnings from graphic packaging international partners, llc (gpip). in total, our equity investments provided $153 million in cash dividends to international paper in 2018.
looking ahead to the first quarter 2019, domestic industry conditions remain healthy. we anticipate lower seasonal demand in north america industrial packaging and brazil papers, as well as lower export volume in industrial packaging, as customer destocking continues. in global cellulose fibers we anticipate lower volume due to slower growth in developing markets and customer destocking, as well as a temporary setback in fluff pulp volume resulting from poor execution of a mix improvement plan. consequently, we expect downward pressure on export price and mix in industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers during the first quarter. operating costs are expected to increase in our three business segments due to lower volume, higher seasonal energy consumption and timing of spending. in addition, planned maintenance outage expense is expected to increase significantly as we move from a low-outage fourth quarter to a heavy-outage first quarter, with first-half 2019 representing nearly 80% of total planned maintenance outage expense in 2019. input costs are expected to be stable in industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers and increase modestly in printing papers, mainly due to higher wood costs in north america. lastly, we expect equity earnings for our ilim joint venture to remain stable in the first quarter.
looking to full-year 2019, we remain focused on maximizing value creation for our shareholders. we anticipate meaningful growth in cash generation driven by commercial and operational excellence, lower capital expenditures and higher dividends from our equity investments. we continue to see healthy box demand in north america industrial packaging and expect solid demand growth for fluff pulp used in absorbent hygiene products. in global cellulose fibers we expect our fluff pulp volume to recover as we execute on our mix improvement initiatives. in printing papers, the business is performing very well and we have good momentum as we move into 2019, with expected price realization from recent price increases. in europe, the benefits of the madrid, spain mill will accelerate through the year. we expect lower planned maintenance outage expense and capital investments of $1.4 billion, which is about $200 million lower than 2018. our ilim joint venture is well positioned to thrive through near-term destocking in softwood market pulp in china and we expect to receive about $200 million in cash dividends from the joint venture in 2019. all in, we expect strong cash generation, which we will use to maximize value for our shareholders by strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. we are committed to a strong and
17
competitive dividend and have a $2.2 billion share repurchase authority remaining.
adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are non-gaap measures and are defined as net earnings from continuing operations (a gaap measure) excluding special items and non-operating pension expense. net earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders are the most directly comparable gaap measures. the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of non-operating pension expense, items considered by management to be unusual and discontinued operations from the earnings reported under gaap. adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. the company believes that using this information, along with the most direct comparable gaap measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations.
the following are reconciliations of earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders to adjusted operating earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders.

free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations. management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, service debt and make investments for future growth. it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the company's ongoing performance, free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods.
the company generated free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations:

results of operations business segment operating profits are used by international paper's management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. international paper believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides a more complete analysis of the results of operations by year. business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, excluding interest expense, net, corporate items, net, corporate special items, net, and non-operating pension expense. business segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a non-gaap financial measure, and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states.
international paper operates in three segments: industrial packaging, global cellulose fibers and printing papers.

•   global cellulose fibers' operating profit of $251 million was $186 million favorable versus 2017 as the benefits of higher average sales price realizations and improved mix were partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher input costs, higher maintenance outage costs and higher operating costs. operating profits in 2018 included a charge of $11 million for the removal of abandoned property at our mills. in 2017, operating earnings included $33 million of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the pulp business acquired in late 2016 from weyerhaeuser, a charge of $14 million for the amortization of the remaining inventory fair value adjustment associated with that acquisition and a charge of $4 million for the removal of abandoned property at our mills.
•   printing papers' profits of $533 million represented a $76 million increase in operating profits from 2017. the benefits from higher average sales price realizations, net of mix, were partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher input costs, higher maintenance outage costs and higher operating costs. operating profits in 2018 included charges of $9 million associated with the announced conversion of a paper machine at our riverdale mill to containerboard production and a charge of $1 million for the removal of abandoned property at our mills. operating profits in 2017 included charges of $2 million for the removal of abandoned property at our mills.
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december 31, 2018, international paper generated $3.2 billion of cash flow from operations compared with $1.8 billion in 2017 and $2.5 billion in 2016. cash flow from operations included $1.25 billion and $750 million of cash pension contributions in 2017 and 2016, respectively. capital spending for 2018 totaled $1.6 billion, or 118% of depreciation and amortization expense. our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $2.1 billion of credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating for our long-term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy.
we expect another strong year of cash generation in 2019, which we will use to maximize shareholder value by strengthening our balance sheet, returning meaningful cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and investing organically to grow future cash generation.
capital spending for 2019 is planned at $1.4 billion, or about 104% of depreciation and amortization, including approximately $400 million of strategic investments.
results of operations while the operating results for international paper's various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in international paper's operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america, europe, russia, latin america, india, north africa and the middle east. factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels, and movements in currency exchange rates.
product prices are affected by general economic trends, inventory levels, currency exchange rate movements and worldwide capacity utilization. in addition to these

north american industrial packaging's sales volumes increased in 2018 compared with 2017 reflecting higher box shipments, partially offset by lower shipments of containerboard to both the domestic and export markets. in 2018, the business took about 518,000 tons of maintenance downtime compared with about 416,000 tons of total downtime in 2017, of which about 35,000 were non-maintenance downtime and 381,000 were maintenance downtime. average sales prices were significantly higher for boxes and for containerboard in export markets. substantially lower input costs for recycled fiber were partially offset by higher costs for wood, energy, chemicals and freight. planned maintenance downtime costs were $50 million higher in 2018, than in 2017. operating costs increased due to inflation, distribution costs and weather-related production constraints in early 2018.
looking ahead to the first quarter of 2019, compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, sales volumes for boxes are expected to be seasonally lower despite two more shipping days. shipments of containerboard to export markets are also expected to decline, reflecting slowing market demand in china and emea. based on pricing to date in the current quarter, average sales prices for boxes are expected to be flat, while average sales prices for export containerboard are expected to be lower. input costs, primarily for wood and energy, are expected to be higher. planned maintenance downtime spending should be about $102 million higher. manufacturing operating costs will be negatively impacted by lower volume and inflation, while distribution costs are also expected to increase.

emea industrial packaging's sales volumes in 2018 were lower than in 2017, reflecting weaker market demand for fruit and vegetable boxes in the euro-zone and slowing economic conditions in turkey. average sales margins decreased slightly, as higher containerboard costs were only partially offset by higher sales prices for boxes. input costs for energy were flat. operating costs rose due to inflation and higher costs associated with the new plant in tangier, morocco. earnings were also negatively impacted by the conversion and ramp-up of the madrid mill.
entering the first quarter of 2019, compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, sales volumes are expected to be seasonally higher. average sales margins are expected to reflect the full realization of box price increases and further board cost reductions. operating costs will benefit from the continued integration of our madrid mill. earnings are expected to be favorably impacted by the increased production volumes of recycled containerboard at the madrid mill.

liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper's liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. while changes in key cash operating costs, such as energy, raw material, mill outage and transportation costs, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on pricing and cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.
cash uses during 2018 were primarily focused on working capital requirements, capital spending, debt reductions and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases under the company's share repurchase program.
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operations, including discontinued operations, totaled $3.2 billion in 2018, compared with $1.8 billion for 2017, and $2.5 billion for 2016. cash used by working capital components (accounts receivable, contract assets and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other) totaled $439 million in 2018, compared with cash used by working capital components of $402 million in 2017, and cash provided by working capital components of $71 million in 2016.

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper, and that can require judgments by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and income taxes. the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company's board of directors.
contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities, including legal, and environmental matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel. liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. the company utilizes its in-house legal and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal and environmental obligations, supplemented as needed by third-party specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities.
we calculate our workers' compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors. the workers' compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure. while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the ultimate settlement of workers' compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements.
impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations or disposals. a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. additionally, evaluation for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually. the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments may require the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management's best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, and various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets. as these key factors change in future periods, the company will update its impairment analysis to reflect its latest estimates and projections.
asu 2011-08, "intangibles - goodwill and other," allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative (step 0) assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. if a step 0 assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that, based on that step 0 assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value.
during 2018, a determination was made that the current carrying value of the long-lived assets of the brazil packaging business exceeded their estimated fair value due to a change in the outlook for the business. management engaged a third party to assist with determining the fair value of the business and the fixed assets. the fair value of the business was calculated using a probability-weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples, and transaction multiples and the fair value of the fixed assets was determined using a market approach. as a result, a pre-tax charge of $122 million ($81 million, net of tax) was recorded related to the impairment of an intangible asset and fixed assets.
the company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the qualitative step 0 analysis to its reporting units as of october 1, 2018. for the current year evaluation, the company assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated
32
fair value of the reporting units. the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the company's reporting units were less than the carrying values of the reporting units.
in addition, the company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation. in consideration of all relevant factors, there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to october 1, 2018.
no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
pension benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper's consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases and mortality rates.
the calculations of pension obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities.
benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31, 2018, for international paper's pension plan were as follows:
in millions                         benefit   fair value of obligation   plan assets u.s. qualified pension        $10,124         $8,735
u.s. nonqualified pension         343         -
non-u.s. pension                  215                 161
the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate u.s. pension obligations for the years shown:
2018                                            2017        2016
discount rate                   4.30   %   3.60   %    4.10   %
rate of compensation increase   2.25   %   3.75   %    3.75   %
international paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on december 31 of each year or more frequently if required, to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan's investment portfolio. the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.
the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31, 2018 was 7.50%.
increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets by an additional 0.25% would decrease (increase) 2019 pension expense by approximately $22 million, while a (decrease) increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately $27 million.
actual rates of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:
year       return   year       return
2018   (3.0   )%    2013   14.1   %
2017   19.3   %     2012   14.1   %
2016    7.1   %     2011    2.5   %
2015    1.3   %     2010   15.1   %
2014    6.4   %     2009   23.8   %
the 2012, 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and temple-inland asset returns. international paper and temple-inland assets were combined in october 2014. the annualized time-weighted rate of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets was 6.0% and 9.8% for the past five and ten years, respectively. the following graph shows the growth of a $1,000 investment in international paper's u.s. pension plan master trust. the graph portrays the time-weighted rate of return from 2008 - 2018.
asc 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive
33
benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years.
net periodic pension plan expenses, calculated for all of international paper's plans, were as follows:
in millions          2018          2017          2016          2015          2014
pension expense u.s. plans           $632          $717          $809          $461          $387
non-u.s. plans          4             5             4             6             -
net expense          $636          $722          $813          $467          $387
the decrease in 2018 pension expense primarily reflects lower interest cost on a lower 2018 projected benefit obligation along with the current year absence of a curtailment loss and special termination benefits associated with the north american consumer packaging transaction, partially offset by a higher settlement loss in the current year associated with the october 2018 annuity purchase transaction.
assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31, 2018, projected future net periodic pension plan expenses would be as follows:
in millions            2020          2019
pension expense u.s. plans          $88          $103
non-u.s. plans        4             4
net expense         $92          $107
the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately $103 million for its u.s. defined benefit plans in 2019, compared to expense of $632 million in 2018. the 2018 expense includes $424 million of settlement accounting charges. excluding these settlement charges, the estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2019 is primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses and lower service cost partially offset by lower asset returns due to the annuity purchase and a decrease in the expected long-term return on asset assumption from 7.50% in 2018 to 7.25% in 2019.
the market value of plan assets for international paper's u.s. qualified pension plan at december 31, 2018 totaled approximately $8.7 billion, consisting of approximately 32% equity securities, 51% debt securities, 11% real estate funds and 6% other assets.
the company's funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the company, and other factors. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. there are no required contributions to the u.s. qualified plan in 2019. the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled $29 million for the year ended december 31, 2018.
income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the company's evaluation of the "more likely than not" outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.
while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.

legal proceedings information concerning the company's environmental and legal proceedings is set forth in note 13 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 62 through 65 of item  8. financial statements and supplementary data.
effect of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood fiber and chemical costs, have an impact on the company's operating results, changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results
34
in each of the last three years. sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors.
foreign currency effects international paper has operations in a number of countries. its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with, imports from other regions. as such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company's financial statements. direct impacts include the translation of international operations' local currency financial statements into u.s. dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the united states (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). in general, a weaker u.s. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper. the currencies that have the most impact are the euro, the brazilian real, the polish zloty and the russian ruble.
market risk we use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. information related to international paper's debt obligations is included in note 15 debt and lines of credit on pages 66 and 67 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 16 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 67 through 70 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. we invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. our investments in marketable securities at december 31, 2018 and 2017 are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.
we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions. derivative instruments, such as, interest rate swaps, may be used to execute this strategy. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $9.2 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively. the potential decline in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately $538 million and $679 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
commodity price risk the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices.
foreign currency risk international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into cross-currency and interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a $8 million liability and a $10 million asset, respectively.
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately $29 million at both december 31, 2018 and 2017.

item 1a.   risk factors this section describes certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. you should consider these risk factors when evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k, because our actual results and financial condition might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements should these risks occur. we face other risks besides those highlighted below. these other risks include additional uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial, but may ultimately have a significant impact. should any of these risks, described below or otherwise, actually occur, our business, financial condition, performance, prospects, value, or results of operations could be negatively affected.
market risks risk or uncertainty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         discussion doing business internationally we conduct manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to a variety of risks associated with doing business internationally. implementation and achievement of international growth objectives also may be impeded by political, social, and economic uncertainties or unrest in countries in which we conduct operations or market or distribute our products.   we maintain significant international operations, including operations in the u.s., canada, mexico, europe, asia pacific and latin america. as a result, we are subject to a number of risks and complications associated with international manufacturing, sales, services, and other operations. these include: risks associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations; difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; enhanced credit risks in certain european countries as well as emerging market regions; customers with longer payment cycles than customers in the united states; significant variations in tax rates among the countries in which we do business, and tax withholding obligations in respect of our earnings; tax laws that restrict our ability to use tax credits, offset gains, or repatriate funds; tariffs, exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country; general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate or where end users of our products are situated, including the potential implications of the u.k. "brexit", for the u.k. and/or regional or global economies, or the withdrawal from the eu of other member countries; difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries; difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights or weaker intellectual property right protections in some countries and difficulties associated with compliance with a variety of laws and regulations governing international trade, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act and laws and regulations dealing with trade with persons in sanctioned countries.
compliance with multiple, and potentially conflicting, international laws and regulations, import and export limitations, anti-corruption laws, and exchange controls may be difficult, burdensome or expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                            we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. we are also subject to limitations on trade with persons in sanctioned countries. while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot assure you that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics.

risk or uncertainty                                                                                                                                discussion economic conditions and financial market access changes in economic climate may adversely affect us.                                                                                               adverse economic cycles or conditions, and customer, regulatory or government response to those cycles or conditions, could affect our results of operations. the onset of these cycles or conditions may not be foreseeable and there can be no assurance when they will begin to improve after they occur. there also can be no assurance as to the strength or length of any recovery from a business downturn or recession. credit and liquidity problems may make it difficult for some businesses to access credit markets and obtain financing and may cause some businesses to curtail spending to conserve cash in anticipation of persistent business slowdowns and liquidity needs. if our customers have difficulty financing their purchases due to tight credit markets or related factors or because of other operational or utilization problems they may be experiencing or otherwise decide to curtail their purchases, our business could be adversely affected. our exposure to bad debt losses could also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered and delivered.many of our customers are governmental entities or other entities that rely on government healthcare systems or government funding. if government funding for healthcare becomes limited or restricted in countries in which we operate, our customers may be unable to pay their obligations on a timely basis or to make payment in full and it may become necessary to increase reserves. in addition, there can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in collection difficulties. prospectively, additional adverse effects resulting from these conditions may include decreased healthcare utilization, further pricing pressure on our products and services, and/or weaker overall demand for our products and services, particularly capital products.
our acquisition activity and ability to grow organically may be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to access the financial markets.   our recent acquisitions have been financed largely through cash on hand and borrowings under our bank credit facilities. future acquisitions or other capital requirements will necessitate additional cash. to the extent our existing sources of cash are insufficient to fund these or other future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through new or expanded borrowing arrangements or equity. there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds beyond those available under existing bank credit facilities on terms favorable to us, or at all, or that such facilities can be replaced when they terminate.

legal, regulatory and tax risks risk or uncertainty                                                                                                                                                                                                           discussion healthcare laws and reimbursement changes in healthcare laws or government and other third-party payor reimbursement levels to healthcare providers, or failure to meet healthcare reimbursement or other requirements, might negatively impact our business.   we sell many of our products and services to hospitals and other healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. many of these customers are subject to or supported by government programs or receive reimbursement for services from third-party payors, such as government programs, including medicare and medicaid in the u.s., private insurance plans, and managed care programs. reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. government-managed healthcare systems control reimbursement for healthcare services in many countries. public budgetary constraints may significantly impact the ability of hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other customers supported by such systems to purchase our products. government or other third-party payors may deny or change coverage, reduce their current levels of reimbursement for healthcare services, or otherwise implement measures to regulate pricing or contain costs. in addition, our costs may increase more rapidly than reimbursement levels or permissible pricing increases or we may not satisfy the standards or requirements for reimbursement. among other provisions, the u.s. patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act, imposed an excise tax on medical devices manufactured or offered for sale in the united states. early in 2018, u.s. congress enacted legislation that extended the suspension of the excise tax, which suspension had been in place in since the beginning of calendar year 2016, for 2018 and 2019. should the u.s. congress take no further action with regard to this tax we will begin to incur excise tax in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. we incurred $5.8 million in medical device excise taxes for fiscal 2016. in addition, we have been required to commit significant resources to "sunshine act" compliance. various additional health care reform proposals have emerged at the federal and state level, and we are unable to predict which, if any, of those proposals will be enacted.

risk or uncertainty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        discussion product and service related regulations and claims we are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations. failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues, profitability, financial condition, or value.   our operations are subject to extensive regulation in the countries where we do business. in the united states, our products and services are regulated by the fda and other regulatory authorities. in many foreign countries, sales of our products and services are subject to extensive regulations that may or may not be comparable to those of the fda. in europe, our products are regulated primarily by country and community regulations of those countries within the european economic area and must conform to the requirements of those authorities.government regulation applies to nearly all aspects of testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storing, recordkeeping, reporting, promoting, distributing, and importing or exporting of medical devices, products, and services. in general, unless an exemption applies, a sterilization, decontamination or medical device or product or service must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold. modifications to existing products or the marketing of new uses for existing products also may require regulatory approvals, approval supplements or clearances. if we are unable to obtain any required approvals, approval supplements or clearances for any modification to a previously cleared or approved device, we may be required to cease manufacturing and sale, or recall or restrict the use of such modified device, pay fines, or take other action until such time as appropriate clearance or approval is obtained.regulatory agencies may refuse to grant approval or clearance, or review and disagree with our interpretation of approvals or clearances, or with our decision that regulatory approval is not required or has been maintained. regulatory submissions may require the provision of additional data and may be time consuming and costly, and their outcome is uncertain. regulatory agencies may also change policies, adopt additional regulations, or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay approval or clearance of devices, or could impact our ability to market a previously cleared, approved, or unregulated device. our failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda or other applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or elsewhere might subject us to administratively or judicially imposed sanctions. these sanctions include, among others, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, injunctions, debarment, product seizure or detention, product recalls and total or partial suspension of production, sale and/or promotion.
our products are subject to recalls and restrictions, even after receiving united states or foreign regulatory clearance or approval.                                                                                                                                                                      ongoing medical device reporting regulations require that we report to appropriate governmental authorities in the united states and/or other countries when our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. governmental authorities can require product recalls or impose restrictions for product design, manufacturing, labeling, clearance, or other issues. for the same reasons, we may voluntarily elect to recall or restrict the use of a product. any recall or restriction could divert managerial and financial resources and might harm our reputation among our customers and other healthcare professionals who use or recommend our products and services.
12
we may be adversely affected by product liability claims or other legal actions or regulatory or compliance matters.   we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions. a significant increase in the number, severity, amount, or scope of these claims and actions may, as described above with respect to recalls and restrictions, result in substantial costs and harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect product sales and our business. product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions may also distract management from other business responsibilities.we are also subject to a variety of other types of claims, proceedings, investigations, and litigation initiated by government agencies or third parties and other potential risks and liabilities. these include compliance matters, product regulation or safety, taxes, employee benefit plans, employment discrimination, health and safety, environmental, antitrust, customs, import/export, government contract compliance, financial controls or reporting, intellectual property, allegations of misrepresentation, false claims or false statements, commercial claims, claims regarding promotion of our products and services, or other similar or different matters. any such claims, proceedings, investigations or litigation, regardless of the merits, might result in substantial costs, restrictions on product use or sales, or otherwise injure our business.administratively or judicially imposed or agreed sanctions might include warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, loss of tax benefits, injunctions, product seizure, recalls, suspensions or restrictions, re-labeling, detention, and/or debarment. we also might be required to take actions such as payment of substantial amounts, or revision of financial statements, or to take, or be subject to, the following types of actions with respect to our products, services, or business: redesign, re-label, restrict, or recall products; cease manufacturing and selling products; seizure of product inventory; comply with a court injunction restricting or prohibiting further marketing and sale of products or services; comply with a consent decree, which could result in further regulatory constraints; dedication of significant internal and external resources and costs to respond to and comply with legal and regulatory issues and constraints; respond to claims, litigation, and other proceedings brought by customers, users, governmental agencies, and others; disruption of product improvements and product launches; discontinuation of certain product lines or services; or other restrictions or limitations on product sales, use or operation, or other activities or business practices.some product replacements or substitutions may not be possible or may be prohibitively costly or time consuming. the impact of any legal, regulatory, or compliance claims, proceeding, investigation, or litigation, is difficult to predict. we maintain product liability and other insurance with coverages believed to be adequate. however, product liability or other claims may exceed insurance coverage limits, fines, penalties and regulatory sanctions may not be covered by insurance, or insurance may not continue to be available or available on commercially reasonable terms. additionally, our insurers might deny claim coverage for valid or other reasons or may become insolvent.
13
our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by difficulties in acquiring or maintaining a proprietary intellectual ownership position.   to maintain our competitive position for our products, we need to obtain patent or other proprietary rights for new and improved products and to maintain and enforce our existing patents and other proprietary rights. we typically apply for patents in the united states and in strategic other countries. we may also acquire patents through acquisitions. we may encounter difficulties in obtaining or protecting patents.we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and confidentiality agreements to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. these measures afford only limited protection, and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. litigation may also be brought against us claiming that we have violated the intellectual property rights of others. litigation may be costly and may divert management's attention from other matters. additionally, in some foreign countries with weaker intellectual property rights, it may be difficult to maintain and enforce patents and other proprietary rights or defend against claims of infringement.
tax and trade risks current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.                                                   the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") was signed into law on december 22, 2017. guidance continues to be issued clarifying the application of this new legislation. we cannot predict the overall impact that the additional guidance may have on our business. it is reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the tcja. in addition, further changes in the tax laws of other jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd). the oecd, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. these contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by oecd members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.
our tax rate is uncertain and may vary from expectations, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and earnings per share.             there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain any particular worldwide effective corporate tax rate. we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates operate. our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectations, and such variance may be material. additionally, tax laws or their implementation and applicable tax authority practices in any particular jurisdiction could change in the future, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could have a material adverse impact on us and our affiliates.
changes in tax treaties and trade agreements could negatively impact our costs, results of operations and earnings per share.                                 legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the u.s. which, if ultimately adopted, could override or otherwise adversely impact tax treaties upon which we rely or broaden the circumstances under which steris plc would be considered a u.s. resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect our tax obligations. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals. however, if proposals were adopted that had the effect of disregarding our organization in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the u.s., we could be subject to increased taxation and/or potentially significant expense.existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. changes in laws and regulations or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular, increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.
14
proposed legislation relating to the denial of u.s. federal or state governmental contracts to u.s. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business.   various u.s. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to redomiciled companies may adversely affect us if adopted into law. we are unable to predict the likelihood that any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments or increased regulatory scrutiny could have on our business.
the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs") may not agree that we are a foreign corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes.                                                although we are organized under the laws of ireland and are a tax resident in ireland for irish tax purposes, the irs may assert that we should be treated as a u.s. corporation (and, therefore, a u.s. tax resident) for u.s. federal tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code" and such section, "section 7874"). for u.s. federal tax purposes, a company generally is considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization. because we are organized under the laws of ireland, we would generally be classified as a non-u.s. corporation (and, therefore, a non-u.s. tax resident) under these rules. section 7874, however, provides an exception to this general rule under which a non-u.s. organized entity may be treated as a u.s. corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes.if we were to be treated as a u.s. corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes, we could be subject to substantial additional u.s. tax liability. additionally, if we were treated as a u.s. corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes, non-u.s. holders of our ordinary shares would be subject to u.s. withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends we paid to such shareholders. for irish tax purposes, we are expected, regardless of any application of section 7874, to be treated as an ireland tax resident. consequently, if we are treated as a u.s. corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes under section 7874, we could be liable for both u.s. and ireland taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
business and operational risks risk or uncertainty                                                                                                                         discussion competition our businesses are highly competitive, and if we fail to compete successfully, our revenues and results of operations may be hurt.          we operate in a highly competitive global environment. our businesses compete with other broad-line manufacturers, as well as many smaller businesses specializing in particular products or services, primarily on the basis of brand, design, quality, safety, ease of use, serviceability, price, product features, warranty, delivery, service, and technical support. we face increased competition from new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, surgical support, cleaning consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, contract sterilization, and other products and services entering the market. competitors and potential competitors also are attempting to develop alternate technologies and sterilizing agents, as well as disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination.
consolidations among our healthcare and pharmaceutical customers may result in a loss of customers or more significant pricing pressures.   a number of our customers have consolidated. these consolidations are due in part to healthcare cost reduction measures initiated by competitive pressures as well as legislators, regulators and third-party payors. this may result in greater pricing pressures on us and in some cases loss of customers. additional consolidations could result in a loss of customers or more significant pricing pressures.
15
decreased availability or increased costs of raw materials or energy supplies or other supplies might increase our production costs or limit our production capabilities or curtail our operations.                                      we purchase raw materials, fabricated and other components, and energy supplies from a variety of suppliers. key materials include stainless steel, organic and inorganic chemicals, fuel, cobalt-60, eo, and plastic components. the availability and prices of raw materials and energy supplies are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. also, certain of our key materials and components have a limited number of suppliers. some are single-sourced in certain regions of the world, such as cobalt-60 and eo, which are necessary to our ast operations. changes in regulatory requirements regarding the use of, the unavailability or short supply of these products might disrupt or cause shutdowns of portions of our ast operations or have other adverse consequences. we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with accelerator-based technologies which may reduce the potential supply risk. shortages in supply, increased regulatory or security requirements, or increases in the price of raw materials, components and energy supplies may adversely affect us.
our operations, and those of our suppliers, are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks, any of which could interrupt production or operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance, results, or value.   business continuity hazards and other risks include: explosions, fires, earthquakes, inclement weather, and other disasters; utility or other mechanical failures; unscheduled downtime; labor difficulties; inability to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits; disruption of communications; data security, preservation and redundancy disruptions; inability to hire or retain key management or employees; disruption of supply or distribution; and regulation of the safety, security or other aspects of our operations.the occurrence of any of these or other events might disrupt or shut down operations, or otherwise adversely impact the production or profitability of a particular facility, or our operations as a whole. certain casualties also might cause personal injury and loss of life, or severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and for casualties occurring at our facilities, result in liability claims against us. although we maintain property and casualty insurance and liability and similar insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for our industries, our insurance coverages have limits and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business.
16
we engage in acquisitions and affiliations, divestitures, and other business arrangements. our growth may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully identify, price, and integrate strategic business candidates or otherwise optimize our business portfolio.   our success depends, in part, on strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, which are intended to complement or expand our businesses, divestiture of non-strategic businesses, and other actions intended to optimize our portfolio of businesses. this strategy depends upon our ability to identify, appropriately price, and complete these types of business development transactions or arrangements and to obtain any necessary financing. in the last several fiscal years we have made a number of acquisitions. we also completed several divestitures of non-strategic businesses or product lines during the last several years.our success with respect to these recent and future acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the businesses acquired, retain key personnel, realize identified cost synergies and otherwise execute our strategies. our success will also depend on our ability to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in joint ventures or other affiliations, or to divest or realign businesses. competition for strategic business candidates may result in increases in costs and price for acquisition candidates and market valuation issues may reduce the value available for divestiture of non-strategic businesses. these types of transactions are also subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties, including: delays in realizing or failure to realize anticipated benefits of the transactions; diversion of management's time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties in retaining key employees, customers, or suppliers of the acquired or divested businesses; difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, or other integration or divestiture difficulties; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers; other events contributing to difficulties in generating future cash flows; risks associated with the assumption of contingent or other liabilities of acquisition targets or retention of liabilities for divested businesses and difficulties in obtaining financing.
if our continuing efforts to create a lean business and in-source production to reduce costs are not successful, our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected.                                                                         we have undertaken various activities to create a lean business, including in-sourcing. we continue to look for opportunities to in-source production that is currently provided by third parties.these activities may not produce the full efficiencies and cost reduction benefits that we expect or efficiencies and benefits might be delayed. implementation costs also might exceed expectations.
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified management and other personnel or other compliance matters adversely impact our personnel.                                                                  our continued success depends, in large part, on our ability to hire and retain highly qualified people and if we are unable to do so, our business and operations may be impaired or disrupted. competition for highly qualified people is intense and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining replacements to fill vacant positions, successors to fill retirements or employees moving to new positions, or other highly qualified personnel. in addition, legal, regulatory or compliance matters create significant distraction or diversion of significant or unanticipated resources or attention that could have a material adverse effect on the responsibilities and retention of qualified employees.
17
we could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers.   we rely extensively on information technology (it) systems to conduct business. in addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our it systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. while we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. enforcement of the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") was effective as of may 2018. the gdpr is focused on the protection of personal data not merely the privacy of personal data. the gdpr creates a range of new compliance obligations and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual revenues for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements).
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for steris and its subsidiaries including:
•   what factors affect our business;
•   what our earnings and costs were;
•   why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;
•   where our earnings came from;
•   how this affects our overall financial condition;
•   what our expenditures for capital projects were; and
•   where cash will come from to fund future debt principal repayments, growth outside of core operations, repurchase ordinary shares, pay cash dividends and fund future working capital needs.
the md&a also analyzes and explains the annual changes in the specific line items in the consolidated statements of income. as you read the md&a, it may be helpful to refer to information in item 1, "business," item 6, "selected financial data," and our consolidated financial statements, which present the results of our operations for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as part i, item 1a, "risk factors" and note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations. this information, discussion, and disclosure may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in steris.
financial measures in the following sections of the md&a, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under u.s. gaap. we sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. we define these financial measures as follows:
•   backlog - we define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. we use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements.
•   debt-to-total capital - we define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders' equity. we use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth.
•   days sales outstanding ("dso") - we define dso as the average collection period for accounts receivable. it is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters' revenues, multiplied by 365 days. we use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect.
we, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. these financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non- gaap financial measure, is available in the subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures."

revenues- defined as required by regulation s-x, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our consolidated statements of income for each period presented. when we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the regulation s-x requirements. the terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. we use the following terms to describe revenues:
•   revenues - our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances.
•   product revenues - we define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products.
•   service revenues - we define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. service revenues also include hospital sterilization services, instrument and scope repairs, and linen management as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our applied sterilization technologies segment. linen management services were divested in fiscal 2017.
•   capital equipment revenues - we define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes steam sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, including system 1 and 1e, washing systems, vhp® technology, water stills, and pure steam generators; surgical lights and tables; and integrated or.
•   consumable revenues - we define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes system 1 and 1e consumables, v-pro consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, sterility assurance products, skin care products, cleaning consumables, barrier product solutions and surgical instruments.
•   recurring revenues - we define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues.
general overview and executive summary steris plc is a leading provider of infection prevention and other procedural products and services. our mission is to help our customers create a healthier and safer world by providing innovative healthcare and life science product and service solutions around the globe. we offer our customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal ("gi") endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair solutions, laboratory testing services, on-site and off-site reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, and connectivity solutions such as operating room ("or") integration.
on march 28, 2019, steris plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of england and wales ("steris uk"), completed a redomiciliation from the united kingdom to ireland (the "redomiciliation"). the redomiciliation was achieved through the insertion of a new irish public limited holding company ("steris ireland") on top of steris uk pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under english law (the "scheme"). following the scheme effectiveness, steris uk was re-registered as a private limited company with the name steris limited, and steris emerald ie limited, a company established in ireland and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of steris ireland, was interposed as the direct parent company of steris uk.
we operate and report in four reportable business segments: healthcare products, healthcare specialty services, life sciences, and applied sterilization technologies. we describe our business segments in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, titled "business segment information."
the bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our customers to operate more efficiently, all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services.
we completed several acquisitions and asset purchases in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 that expanded our product and service offerings to our customers.
26
during fiscal 2018, we divested our synergy health healthcare consumable solutions ("hcs") business with annual revenues of approximately $40 million. during fiscal 2017, we divested our applied infection control ("aic") product line and four businesses acquired in the acquisition of synergy health including: all of the linen management services businesses and synergy health laboratory services.
we continue to invest in manufacturing in-sourcing projects and lean process improvements for the purpose of improving quality, cost and delivery of our products to our customers.
u.s. tax reform. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja"). the tcja made broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax ("amt"); (3) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax ("beat"), a new minimum tax; (4) a general elimination of u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from non-u.s. subsidiaries; (5) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti"), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ("ftcs") and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (6) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (7) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (8) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (9) limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the u.s. income tax liability; and (10) limitations on net operating losses ("nols") generated after december 31, 2017, to 80.0 percent of taxable income.
fiscal 2019 restructuring plan. during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the "fiscal 2019 restructuring plan"), which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities, one in brazil and one in england, as well as other actions including, the rationalization of certain products. fewer than 200 positions are being eliminated. the company will relocate the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020. these restructuring actions are designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency. for additional information on restructuring see the subsection titled "restructuring expenses", located in the results of operations section of this md&a, or note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, titled "restructuring".
highlights.  revenues increased $162.2 million, or 6.2%, to $2,782.2 million for the year ended march 31, 2019, as compared to $2,620.0 million for the year ended march 31, 2018. this increase reflects organic growth in all business segments, which was partially offset by the impact of our fiscal 2018 divestiture of hcs and unfavorable fluctuations in currencies.
fiscal 2019 operating income increased 2.9% to $411.5 million over fiscal 2018 operating income of $399.9 million. the increase is attributable to increased volume and fluctuations in currencies and the positive impact from our fiscal 2018 divestiture of hcs, which were partially offset by costs associated with our fiscal 2019 restructuring plan.
net cash flows from operations were $539.5 million and free cash flow was $355.4 million in fiscal 2019 compared to net cash flows from operations of $457.6 million and free cash flow of $294.3 million in fiscal 2018 (see subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures). the improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to the improved cash from operations, which was partially offset by higher capital expenditures.
our debt-to-total capital ratio was 27.1% at march 31, 2019. during the year, we increased our quarterly dividend for the thirteenth consecutive year to $0.34 per share per quarter.
outlook. fluctuations in currency rates can impact revenues and costs outside of the united states, creating variability in our results for fiscal 2020 and beyond.
in fiscal 2020 and beyond, we expect to continue to manage our costs, grow our business with internal product and service development, invest in greater capacity, and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitions of additional products and services.
27
non-gaap financial measures we, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented.
these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
these non-gaap financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the board of directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. these amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented.
we believe that the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures, when considered along with our gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding gaap financial measures, provide the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. it is important for the reader to note that the non-gaap financial measure used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies.
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. we use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares. the following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended march 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:

nm - not meaningful selling, general, and administrative expenses. significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses ("sg&a") are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment, facilities costs, gains or losses from divestitures, and other general and administrative expenses. sg&a increased 6.0% in fiscal 2019 over fiscal 2018, largely due to additional expenses associated with our fiscal 2019 restructuring plan. additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the healthcare products business segment, which resulted in an impairment charge of $16.2 million.
research and development. research and development expenses increased $2.3 million during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, due primarily to increased spending within the healthcare products segment. research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. during fiscal 2019, our investments in research and development continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.
restructuring expenses. during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the "fiscal 2019 restructuring plan"), which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities, one in brazil and one in england, as well as other actions including, the rationalization of certain products. fewer than 200 positions are being eliminated. the company will relocate the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020. these restructuring actions are designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency.
we have incurred pre-tax expenses totaling $40.7 million related to these restructuring actions, of which $31.0 million was recorded as restructuring expenses and $9.7 million was recorded in cost of revenues, with a total of $28.4 million, $2.5 million, $0.7 million, and $7.8 million related to the healthcare products, healthcare specialty services, life sciences, and applied sterilization technologies segments, respectively. corporate related restructuring charges were $1.3 million. we expect to incur additional restructuring expenses related to this plan of approximately $3.0 million in fiscal 2020 and beyond.

interest expense decreased $5.6 million during fiscal 2019, as compared to 2018. this decrease was primarily due to: (i) reduced interest rates on our 2008 and 2012 private placement notes, (ii) replacement of higher cost fixed rate debt with lower cost floating rate debt as a result of $85.0 million of 2008 private placement notes maturing during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and (iii) overall lower debt levels (refer to our note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, titled "debt", for more information).
interest income and miscellaneous expense decreased by $2.7 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to unrealized losses on our equity investments (refer to our note 17 to our consolidated financial statements, titled "fair value measurements" for more information).
additional information regarding our outstanding debt is included in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "debt," and in the subsection of this md&a titled, "liquidity and capital resources."

the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 17.4% as compared to 17.8% for fiscal 2018. the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate decreased when compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due the reduction in the us statutory tax rate from a blended rate of 31.5% to 21%.  this was offset unfavorably by non-recurring tcja impacts benefiting fiscal 2018.  additional information regarding our income tax expense is included in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "income taxes."
business segment results of operations. we operate and report in four reportable business segments: healthcare products, healthcare specialty services, life sciences, and applied sterilization technologies. non-allocated operating costs that support the entire company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income.
our healthcare products segment offers infection prevention and procedural solutions for healthcare providers worldwide, including consumable products, equipment maintenance and installation services, and capital equipment.
our healthcare specialty services segment provides a range of specialty services for healthcare providers including hospital sterilization services and instrument and scope repairs.
our life sciences segment offers consumable products, equipment maintenance, specialty services and capital equipment primarily for pharmaceutical manufacturers.
our applied sterilization technologies segment offers contract sterilization and laboratory services primarily for medical device and pharmaceutical customers.
we disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. the accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated company. in fiscal 2019, we ceased the allocation of certain corporate costs to our segments to align with internal management measures. the prior period operating income measures have been recast for comparability.
for more information regarding our segments please refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled "business segment information," and item 1, "business".

revenues increased $7.2 million, or 0.3%, to $2,620.0 million for the year ended march 31, 2018, as compared to $2,612.8 million for the year ended march 31, 2017. this increase is primarily attributable to organic growth within all business segments, favorable pricing, the benefit of acquisitions and the positive impact of fluctuations in currencies. these increases were largely offset by the impact of our recent divestitures.
service revenues for fiscal 2018 decreased $15.1 million, or 1.1%, over fiscal 2017, as the impact of recent divestitures more than offset increases in other service offerings. consumable revenues increased $22.7 million, or 4.1%, during fiscal 2018 over fiscal 2017, reflecting growth within the healthcare products and life sciences business segments, which more than offset the impact of the divestitures of the aic product line and hcs business within the healthcare products segment. capital equipment revenues decreased by $0.4 million, or 0.1%, during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, reflecting a decline in revenues from the healthcare products segment, which was offset by growth in revenues from the life sciences segment.
ireland revenues for fiscal 2018 were $48.2 million, an increase of $5.5 million, or 12.9%, over fiscal 2017 revenues of $42.7 million, reflecting increases in consumable and service revenues, which were partially offset by decline in capital equipment revenues.
united states revenues for fiscal 2018 were $1,836.4 million, an increase of $33.0 million, or 1.8%, over fiscal 2017 revenues of $1,803.5 million. strength in life sciences capital equipment and strength in service offerings within the healthcare products, life sciences and applied sterilization technologies segments more than offset the negative impact of the decline in capital equipment revenues within the healthcare products segment and the recent divestitures.
33
revenues from other foreign locations for fiscal 2018 were $735.3 million, a decrease of 4.1% over the fiscal 2017 revenues of $766.6 million, primarily due to the fiscal 2017 divestiture of the netherlands linen management services, which more than offset growth in canada and in the asia pacific and latin america regions.

nm - not meaningful selling, general, and administrative expenses. significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses ("sg&a") are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment, facilities costs, gains or losses from divestitures, and other general and administrative expenses. sg&a decreased 7.3% in fiscal 2018 over fiscal 2017. the decline was primarily attributable to a lower net loss on divestitures and lower acquisition and integration costs incurred in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.
goodwill impairment loss. goodwill impairment loss of $58.4 million was recorded during fiscal 2017 as a result of our annual goodwill impairment review in the third quarter relative to the synergy health netherlands linen management reporting unit.
research and development. research and development expenses increased $1.4 million during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. during fiscal 2018, our investments in research and development continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.

interest expense increased $6.1 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to 2017. this increase was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of higher-cost, fixed rate debt following the issuance and sale of senior notes in a private placement to certain investors on february 27, 2017.
the increase in interest income and miscellaneous expense was primarily due to our retrospective adoption of asu 2017-07, "compensation - retirement benefits - improving the presentation of net periodic pension and net periodic postretirement benefit cost". additional information regarding the standard can be found in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies."

effective income tax rate            17.8     %              40.1     %
the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 17.8% as compared to 40.1% for fiscal 2017. the fiscal 2018 effective tax rate decreased when compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the tcja impact and non-recurring nondeductible costs related to divestitures. additional information regarding our income tax expense is included in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "income taxes."
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja"). the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no.118 ("sab 118"), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tcja. sab 118, provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tcja enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 740, income taxes. our accounting for the various elements of the tcja was incomplete at march 31, 2018. however, in accordance with sab 118 guidance, we were able to make what we believed to be reasonable estimates of certain effects and therefore recorded a provisional net tax benefit of approximately $18.9 million related to the reduction of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate and the deemed repatriation transition tax. during fiscal 2019, the company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the tcja.  during fiscal 2019, the company recorded an immaterial favorable adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded as of march 31, 2018 for remeasurement of the company's deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.

we disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. the accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated company. in fiscal 2019, we ceased the allocation of certain corporate costs to our segments to align with internal management measures. the prior period operating income measures have been recast for comparability.

•   on march 23, 2018, steris uk and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with various financial institutions as lenders, and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent. steris ireland subsequently became a borrower and guarantor under the credit agreement. the credit agreement replaced a bank credit facility dated march 31, 2015. the credit agreement provides up to $1.0 billion of credit, in the form of a revolver facility, which may be utilized for revolving credit borrowings, swing line borrowings and letters of credit, with sublimits for swing line borrowings and letters of credit. the revolver facility may be increased in specified circumstances by up to $500.0 million. the credit agreement will mature on march 23, 2023, and all unpaid borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, are repayable on that date. the credit agreement contains leverage and interest coverage covenants. borrowings may be taken in u.s. dollars, euros, and pounds sterling and certain other specified currencies and bear interest at our option based upon either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate, plus the applicable margin in effect from time to time under the credit agreement. the applicable margin is determined based on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda (as such terms are defined in the credit agreement). interest on base rate advances is payable quarterly in arrears and interest on eurocurrency rate advances is payable at the end of the relevant interest period therefor, but in no event less frequently than every three months. borrowings at closing were used to repay outstanding balances of debt outstanding under the former bank credit facility dated march 31, 2015 that was scheduled to mature on march 31, 2020 and for other general corporate purposes.
•   the credit agreement was amended in march 2019, in connection with the redomiciliation to permit the redomiciliation. the amendments did not effect any material changes in the terms of the credit agreement regarding borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit.

•   on february 27, 2017, steris uk issued and sold an aggregate principal amount of $95.0 million, €99.0 million, and £75.0 million, of senior notes in a private placement to certain institutional investors in an offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. these notes have maturities of between 10 and 15 years from the issue date. the agreement governing these notes contains leverage and interest coverage covenants.
•   on may 15, 2015, steris corporation issued and sold $350.0 million of senior notes, in a private placement to certain institutional investors in an offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. these notes have maturities of 10 to 15 years from the issue date. the agreement governing these notes contains leverage and interest coverage covenants.
•   the agreements governing certain senior notes issued and sold in february 2013, december 2012, and august 2008, were amended and restated in their entirety on march 31, 2015. all of these notes were issued and sold in private placements to certain institutional investors in offerings that were exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. the amended and restated agreements, which have been consolidated into a single agreement for the 2013 and 2012 notes, and a separate single agreement for the 2008 notes, contain leverage and interest coverage covenants.
•   all of the note agreements were amended in march 2019, in connection with the redomiciliation. the amendments waived certain repurchase rights of the note holders and increased the size of certain baskets to more closely align with credit agreement baskets.
as of march 31, 2019, a total of $301.8 million was outstanding under the credit agreement, based on currency exchange rates as of march 31, 2019. at march 31, 2019, we had $693.4 million of unused funding available under the credit agreement. the credit agreement includes a sub-limit that reduces the maximum amount available to us by letters of credit outstanding. at march 31, 2019, there was $4.8 million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement.
at march 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our indebtedness. we provide additional information regarding our debt structure and payment obligations in the section of the md&a titled, "liquidity and capital resources" in the subsection titled, "contractual and commercial commitments" and in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "debt."

capital expenditures our capital expenditure program is a component of our long-term strategy. this program includes, among other things, investments in new and existing facilities, business expansion projects, radioisotope (cobalt-60), and information technology enhancements and research and development advances. during fiscal 2019, our capital expenditures amounted to $189.7 million. we use cash provided by operating activities and our cash and cash equivalent balances to fund capital expenditures. we expect fiscal 2020 capital expenditures to increase to approximately $280.0 million, reflecting continued facility expansions, particularly within the applied sterilization technologies segment and general maintenance for existing facilities.
contractual and commercial commitments at march 31, 2019, we had commitments under non-cancelable operating leases totaling $162.4 million.
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march 31, 2019 are presented in the following tables. commercial commitments include standby letters of credit, letters of credit required as security under our self-insured risk retention policies, and other potential cash outflows resulting from events that require us to fulfill commitments.

critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions the following subsections describe our most critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions. our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies."
estimates and assumptions.  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. we make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements. these estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. as a result, actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates. we periodically review these critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company's board of directors.
revenue recognition.  revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the customer. revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services. product revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer, which is generally based on contract or shipping terms. service revenue is recognized when the customer benefits from the service, which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the customer. our customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor, and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale. our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products. shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in product revenues. the associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues. revenues are reported net of sales and value-added taxes collected from customers.
we have individual customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. we reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded. the reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. estimated returns are recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets.
in transactions that contain multiple performance obligations, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the customer. we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately.
payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. we do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year.
we do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less.
certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. at march 31, 2019 assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.  we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by customers. we estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors, including amounts written off historically, customer payment practices, and general economic conditions. we also analyze significant customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific customer's inability to pay. as a result, the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible. these analyses require a considerable amount of judgment. if the financial condition of our customers worsens, or economic conditions change, we may be required to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.
allowance for sales returns.  we maintain an allowance for sales returns based upon known returns and estimated returns for both capital equipment and consumables. we estimate returns of capital equipment and consumables based upon historical experience.
inventories and reserves.  inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value. we determine cost based upon a combination of the last-in, first-out ("lifo") and first-in, first-out ("fifo") cost methods. we determine the lifo inventory value at the end of the year based on inventory levels and costs at that time. for inventories valued using the lifo method, we believe that the use of the lifo method results in a matching of current costs and revenues. inventories valued using the lifo method represented approximately 25.2% and 26.0% of total inventories at march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. inventory
42
costs include material, labor, and overhead. if we had used only the fifo method of inventory costing, inventories would have been $16.8 million and $17.3 million higher than those reported at march 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
we review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence. we record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. if future market conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.
asset impairment losses.  property, plant, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and, if impairment exists, we record the loss in the consolidated statements of income during that period.
when we evaluate assets for impairment, we make certain judgments and estimates, including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations, evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations, historical and anticipated performance of operations, and other factors. if we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected.
asset retirement obligations. we incur retirement obligations for certain assets. we record an initial liability for the asset retirement obligations (aro) at fair value. accounting for the aro at inception and in subsequent periods includes the determination of the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset, and a periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates used in the analysis. we provide additional information about our asset retirement obligations in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "property, plant and equipment."
restructuring.  we record specific accruals in connection with plans for restructuring elements of our business. these accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, and contractual obligations. actual amounts could differ from the original estimates. we review our restructuring-related accruals on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period the change is identified.
purchase accounting and goodwill.  assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. we supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. these valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. we generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets. we do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results.
we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. in those circumstances, we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. we calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
as a result of our annual impairment review for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018, no indicators of impairment were identified. as a result of our annual goodwill impairment review for fiscal year 2017, we concluded that the carrying value of one of our reporting units exceeded its fair value. prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2017, the synergy health netherlands linen management unit was reported within our healthcare specialty services segment. financial forecasts prepared for the annual assessment reflected pricing pressures, volume declines driven by overcapacity in the market, and a decline in the overall market size. these factors resulted in further degradation of the already low operating margin and cash flows of this unit. we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $58.4 million as a result, which was recorded within goodwill impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income. the fair market value of the reporting unit was determined under an income approach using discounted cash flows and estimated fair market values. fair value calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumptions including risk adjusted discount rates and financial forecasts.
43
we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions, and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists. during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, management adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the healthcare products business segment. as a result, management recorded an impairment charge of $16.2 million, which is included within the selling, general, and administrative line of the consolidated statements of income. the remaining fair value of the asset was calculated using an income approach (the relief from royalty method). the remaining fair value was not material and will be amortized over the asset's remaining useful life. fair value calculated using this approach is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumption. during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted a new branding strategy change as part of the integration of certain synergy health operations into the healthcare specialty services segment. under this new branding strategy, hospital sterilization services and instrument repair services will utilize the steris instrument management services brand name. the synergy health trade name was phased out during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. as a result, we shortened the estimated useful life of the synergy health trade name and accelerated the corresponding amortization expense over the remainder of fiscal 2017, which totaled $14.4 million and was recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense line on the consolidated statements of income.
income taxes.  our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities. we use significant judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions. we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. we cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us. the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can, in some instances, ultimately be determined be several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published.
we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance. we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position, and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position, is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. we review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period.

self-insurance liabilities.  we record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers' compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. we use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability. this liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims. we review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. we maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. the obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation. estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the "prepaid expenses and other current assets" line, and the "other assets" line of our consolidated balance sheets. our accrual for self-insured risk retention as of march 31, 2019 and 2018 was $19.7 million and $20.9 million, respectively.
we are also self-insured for employee medical claims. we estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience. our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. if actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments, we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods.
contingencies.  we are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. these legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.
we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. we consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. in our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. however, the ultimate outcome of proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. we record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for additional information.
we are subject to taxation from federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. the irs of the united states routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns.
additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies."
benefit plans.  we provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees. in addition, we sponsor an unfunded post-retirement benefits plan for two groups of united states retirees. benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance, including prescription drug coverage.

employee pension and post-retirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore, require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans. changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations. we believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. a summary of significant assumptions used to determine the march 31, 2019 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2019 net periodic benefit costs is as follows:

we develop our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisors, taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios, and the long-term asset class return expectations. generally, net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2019 benefit costs by less than $0.1 million.
we develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers, taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade long-term bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations. generally, the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other post-retirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2019 net periodic benefit costs by less than $0.1 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately $11.8 million at march 31, 2019.
we have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other post-retirement benefit obligation. the assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five year-period from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 6.8% to the assumed long-term healthcare cost trend rate. a 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate (including medical, prescription drug, and long-term rates) would have had the following effect at march 31, 2019:

we recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in our balance sheets. this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. we measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "benefit plans," contains additional information about our pension and other post-retirement welfare benefits plans.

share-based compensation.  we measure the estimated fair value for share-based compensation awards, including grants of employee stock options, at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. we selected the black-scholes-merton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our share-based stock option compensation awards. this model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect share-based compensation expense.
share-based compensation expense was $24.0 million in fiscal 2019, $22.2 million in fiscal 2018 and $18.8 million in fiscal 2017. note 14 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "share-based compensation," contains additional information about our share-based compensation plans.
recently issued accounting standards impacting the company recently issued accounting standards that are relevant to us are presented in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies."
inflation our business has not been significantly impacted by the overall effects of inflation. we monitor the prices we charge for our products and services on an ongoing basis and plan to adjust those prices to take into account future changes in the rate of inflation. however, we may not be able to completely offset the impact of inflation.

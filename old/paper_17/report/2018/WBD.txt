item 1a. risk factors.
investing in our securities involves risk. in addition to the other information contained in this report, you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities.
risks related to our business there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content, which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways.
technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly. consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable.
consumers are increasingly viewing content on a time-delayed or on-demand basis from traditional distributors and from connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens, such as televisions, tablets, mobile phones and other devices. additionally, devices that allow users to view television programs on a time-shifted basis and technologies that enable users to fast-forward or skip programming, including commercials, such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues. there is increased demand for short-form, user-generated and interactive content, which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings. likewise, distributors are offering smaller programming packages known as "skinny bundles," which are delivered at a lower cost than traditional offerings and sometimes allow consumers to create a customized package of networks, that are gaining popularity among consumers. if our networks are not included in these packages or consumers favor alternative offerings, we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately the demand for our programming, which could lead to lower distribution and advertising revenues. we have also seen declines in subscribers to the traditional cable bundle. in 2018, total u.s. networks portfolio subscribers declined 4% while subscribers to our fully distributed networks were consistent with the prior year. each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us, so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not completely predictable. distribution windows are also evolving, potentially affecting revenues from other windows. if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences, our business could be adversely affected.
consolidation among cable and satellite providers, both domestically and internationally, could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.
consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers, including us. in the u.s., approximately 96% of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors. for the international networks segment, approximately 39% of distribution revenue comes from the 10 largest distributors. we currently have agreements in place with the major cable and satellite operators in u.s. networks and international networks which expire at various times through 2023. some of our largest distributors have combined, and as a result, have gained, or may gain, market power, which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms. in addition, many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors. continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming, subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts, and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment content by our u.s. and foreign viewers, which may be unpredictable and volatile.
the production and distribution of entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general, in special interest groups, in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces. as the home of the olympic games in europe until 2024, we have been developing and innovating new forms of content in connection with the olympic games. our success with the olympics depends on audience acceptance of this content. if viewers do not find our olympic games content acceptable, we could see low viewership, which could lead to low distribution and advertising revenues.
the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace. other factors, including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions, piracy, and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content. audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive, and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors. consequently, reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations.

as a company that has operations in the united kingdom, the vote by the united kingdom to leave the e.u. could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial position.
on june 23, 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union ("e.u."), commonly referred to as "brexit." as a result of the referendum, the british government has begun negotiating the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the e.u. ratification should be finalized by march 29, 2019, although there is still considerable political uncertainty around the outcome. the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the u.k. makes to retain access to the e.u. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose subscribers, distributors and employees. if the u.k. loses access to the single e.u. market, it could have a detrimental impact on our u.k. growth. such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more complex, which could involve operational changes in order to protect, delay and reduce the scope of our distribution and licensing agreements. without access to the single e.u. market, it may be more challenging and costly to obtain intellectual property rights for our content within the u.k. or distribute our services in europe. discovery, like many international media businesses, has sought to mitigate this risk by applying for broadcast licenses in remaining e.u. member states. there can be no assurance that this will be successful. in addition, brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the u.k. determines which e.u. laws to replace and replicate. if there are changes to u.k. immigration policy as a result of brexit, this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the e.u. member states for work-related matters.
the announcement of brexit has caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. with the expansion of our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuation has increased. this increase in exposure could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and net asset balances, as there can be no assurance that the downward trend of the british pound and the euro will rebound. brexit may also create global uncertainty, which may cause a decrease in consumer discretionary spending. these decreases in consumer discretionary spending may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions where our networks are distributed. this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming, which could in turn have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and distribution revenues. a decrease in our viewing subscribers would have a negative impact on the number of viewers watching our programming, possibly impacting the rates we are able to charge for advertising. any of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial position.
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions.
we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies. as a result, we have exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions and make investments denominated in multiple currencies. the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the u.s. dollar. our consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the u.s. from local currencies into u.s. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. this increased exposure could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances. there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market.
our businesses operate in highly competitive industries.
the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive. we compete with other programming networks for distribution, viewers and advertising. we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment, such as home video, movies, periodicals, on-line and mobile activities. in particular, websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth, a portion of which has moved from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers. businesses, including ours, that offer multiple services, or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content, may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations. if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights, it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks. the ability of our businesses to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content, access our niche viewership with appealing category-specific content, adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
24
failure to renew, renewal with less favorable terms, or termination of our affiliation agreements may cause a decline in our revenue.
because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors, such as cable and satellite operators, which in turn distribute them to consumers, we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators. these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive, such as channel placement and programming package inclusion (widely distributed, broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed, specialized programming packages) and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks. while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue, these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue. our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor, and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us. a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks, could adversely affect our distribution revenue. such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue. in addition, our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated. if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement, our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected.
interpretation of some terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements.
some of our distribution agreements contain "most favored nation" clauses. these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms, we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors. we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements. while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements, these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that, if correct, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
we face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our programming services, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.
our on-line, mobile and app offerings, as well as our internal systems, involve the storage and transmission of personal and proprietary information, and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming. our systems may be breached due to employee error, malicious code, hacking and phishing attacks, or otherwise. additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data and systems. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures, notwithstanding our ongoing efforts to develop and implement robust data security tools, practices, and protocols. any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information, which may include user data, a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services, damage to our brands and reputation, a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services, and significant legal and financial exposure, each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.
in addition, we face regulatory risk associated with the acquisition, storage, disclosure, use and protection of personal data, including under the european union general data protection regulation ("gdpr") and various other domestic and international privacy and data security laws and regulations, which are continually evolving. these evolving data protection laws may require discovery to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures, and discovery's actual or alleged failure to comply with such laws could result in legal claims, regulatory enforcement actions and significant fines and penalties.
financial performance for our equity method investments and investments without readily determinable fair value may differ from current estimates.
we have equity investments in several entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity. any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment. in addition, if these entities were to fail and cease operations, we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits. some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding. we also have significant investments in entities that we have accounted for as investments without readily determinable fair value. if these entities experience significant losses or were to fail and cease operations, our investments could be subject to impairment and the loss of a part or all of our investment value.
25
we may not be able to successfully integrate the scripps networks business with our own, realize the anticipated benefits of the scripps networks acquisition or manage our expanded operations, any of which would adversely affect our results of operations.
we have devoted, and expect to continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating our organization, procedures, and operations with those of scripps networks. such integration efforts are costly due to the large number of processes, policies, procedures, locations, operations, technologies and systems to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, service, operations, payroll, pricing, marketing and employee benefits. integration expenses could, particularly in the short term, exceed the cost synergies we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale, which could result in significant charges to earnings that we cannot currently quantify. potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:
•   our inability to successfully combine our business with scripps networks in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the full synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the merger; and
•   complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating products, services, complex and different information technology systems, control and compliance processes, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a cohesive manner.
following the merger, the size and complexity of the business of the combined company increased significantly. our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits anticipated from the merger.
general risks theft of our content, including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content, may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability.
the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content. we are fundamentally a content company, and piracy of our brands, television networks, digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us. piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the u.s. it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners' ability to protect and exploit their property. the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content. litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
26
we are subject to risks related to our international operations.
we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states. as a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. these risks include:
•   laws and policies affecting trade and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;
•   changes in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on content, imposition of local content quotas and restrictions on foreign ownership;
•   differing degrees of protection for intellectual property and varying attitudes towards the piracy of intellectual property;
•   significant fluctuations in foreign currency value;
•   currency exchange controls;
•   the instability of foreign economies and governments;
•   war and acts of terrorism;
•   anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations and changes in these laws and regulations;
•   foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulation and changes in these laws; and
•   shifting consumer preferences regarding the viewing of video programming.
events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from non-u.s. sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.
furthermore, some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the u.s. we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes, including the imposition of new restrictions, in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business. acts of terrorism, hostilities, or financial, political, economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business.
our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruptions to financial markets. we derive substantial revenues from advertisers, and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns. financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the u.s. and other countries where our networks are distributed could adversely affect advertising rates and volume, resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues.
decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the u.s. and other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions, in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried. this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multi-channel video programming distributors, which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and affiliation fee revenues. similarly, a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks, which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers.
economic conditions affect a number of aspects of our businesses worldwide and impact the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks and might reduce their spending on advertising. economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world, specifically, could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas.
domestic and foreign laws and regulations could adversely impact our operation results.
programming services like ours, and the distributors of our services, including cable operators, satellite operators and other multi-channel video programming distributors, are regulated by u.s. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the fcc, as well as by state and local governments, in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business. see the discussion under "business - regulatory matters" above. the u.s. congress, the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration, and may adopt or interpret in the future, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations of our u.s. media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate.
27
similarly, the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have, in varying degrees, laws and regulations governing our businesses. programming businesses are subject to regulation on a country-by-country basis. changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope.
financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain or increase the cost of financing our operations and our ability to meet our other obligations.
increased volatility and disruptions in the u.s. and global financial and equity markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing. our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing. unforeseeable changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios.
acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction.
from time to time we make acquisitions, investments and enter into other strategic transactions, including the transaction with scripps networks. in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, subscribers, affiliates and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. additionally, regulatory agencies, such as the fcc or u.s. department of justice may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic transactions. the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business.
our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm our operating results.
our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. we have acquired, and have made strategic investments in, a number of companies (including through joint ventures) in the past, and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, use of our cash resources, and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks, including:
•   the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations;
•   the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;
•   the incurrence of additional operating losses and operating expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;
•   the difficulty of integrating acquired technology and rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;
•   the failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;
•   the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;
•   the potential for patent and trademark infringement and data privacy and security claims against the acquired companies, or companies in which we have invested;
•   litigation or other claims in connection with acquisitions, acquired companies, or companies in which we have invested;
•   the impairment or loss of relationships with customers and partners of the companies we acquired or in which we invested or with our customers and partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations;
•   the impairment of relationships with, or failure to retain, employees of acquired companies or our existing employees as a result of integration of new personnel;
•   our lack of, or limitations on our, control over the operations of our joint venture companies;
•   the difficulty of integrating operations, systems, and controls as a result of cultural, regulatory, systems, and operational differences;
28
•   in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and
•   the impact of known potential liabilities or liabilities that may be unknown, including as a result of inadequate internal controls, associated with the companies we acquired or in which we invested.
our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.
the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue.
our business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities. with respect to the scripps networks acquisition, our success depends in part upon our ability to retain key employees. following the completion of a merger, like the scripps acquisition, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with discovery and choose to pursue other opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on discovery. if key employees depart, the integration of scripps networks with discovery may be more difficult and our business may be adversely affected. additionally, we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences. these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content. there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences. if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base, our operations could be adversely affected.
us tax reform could adversely impact our international business and results of operations.
recently enacted us tax reform could adversely impact our business and results of operations. on december 22, 2017, president trump signed the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja"), which includes a broad range of tax reform regulations affecting businesses, including corporate tax rates, business deductions, and international tax provisions. some of the changes, like the new tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti"), a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income, has had an adverse impact to the results of our international operations. others, like the reduction to the us corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, has had a positive impact to our overall tax liability. and some, like the base erosion and anti-abuse tax ("beat"), have resulted in little or no impact. additional guidance continues to be issued through treasury's proposed and final regulations and we continue to assess their impact.
outside of the u.s., we continue to face the increasing complexity of operating in multiple non-us jurisdictions, many of which have increased scrutiny and have either changed, or plan to change, their international tax systems due to the organisation for economic co-operation and development's ("oecd") base erosion and profit shifting ("beps") recommendations. the beps recommendations call for enhanced transparency and reporting relating to companies' entity structures and transfer pricing policies. these have been implemented through various initiatives including the requirement for taxpayers to comply with global country-by-country reporting and the filing of a global master file as well as the introduction of the multilateral instrument ("mli") which allows taxing authorities to better take aim at multinational tax avoidance. we continue to address and comply with these compliance and reporting requirements.
additional complexity has also arisen in state aid: state resources used to provide recipients an advantage on a selective basis that has or could distort competition and affect trade between european member states. in recent years the european commission ("ec") has increased their scrutiny on state aid and deviated from the historical european union ("eu") state aid practices. there is great uncertainty about the future of eu state aid practices based on the appeals of many significant ec rulings against multinational corporations that are currently being challenged. while any potential impact of these rulings is difficult to assess, we believe our transfer pricing analyses conducted pursuant to accepted oecd methodologies assist in mitigating risk associated with our past or current agreements.
in addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.
29
risks related to our debt we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business.
as of december 31, 2018, we had approximately $17 billion of consolidated debt, including capital leases, of which $1.9 billion is current. our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on, or other amounts associated with our indebtedness. in addition, we have the ability to draw down our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility in the ordinary course, which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness. we are also permitted, subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, to obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs. this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations, including:
•   impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt in the event that an uncured default occurs;
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and market conditions;
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing;
•   requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes;
•   requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete; and
•   placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.
our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility.
the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants, as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests. these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors, who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities.
risks related to corporate structure as a holding company, we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments.
our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash. we are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments, availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. the ability of our operating subsidiaries, including discovery communications, llc, to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions, including restrictions under our credit facility, to which they may be or may become subject. under the tcja, we were subject to u.s. taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations. the company intends to continue to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s., and current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations.
30
we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation ("liberty media"), liberty global plc ("liberty global"), liberty interactive corporation ("liberty interactive") and liberty broadband corporation ("liberty broadband"), which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts.
liberty media, liberty global, liberty interactive and liberty broadband (together, the "liberty entities") own interests in various u.s. and international companies, such as charter communications, inc. ("charter"), that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer. we have no rights in respect of u.s. or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any liberty entities, and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders. because we and the liberty entities have overlapping directors, the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams. our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including any liberty entities), for which such individual serves as a director or officer, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged.
we have directors that are also related persons of advance/newhouse and that overlap with those of the liberty entities, which may lead to conflicting interests for those tasked with the fiduciary duties of our board.
our twelve-person board of directors includes three designees of advance/newhouse, including robert j. miron, who was the chairman of advance/newhouse until december 31, 2010, and steven a. miron, the chief executive officer of advance/newhouse. in addition, our board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media, three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global, one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of liberty interactive, two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty broadband and one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of charter, of which liberty broadband owns an equity interest. john c. malone is the chairman of the boards of all of the liberty entities. the parent company of advance/newhouse and the liberty entities own interests in a range of media, communications and entertainment businesses.
advance/newhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a-1 convertible preferred stock. the advance/newhouse series a-1 convertible preferred stock, which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors, represents approximately 24% of the voting power of our outstanding shares. the series a-1 convertible preferred stock also grants advance/newhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions, including fundamental changes to our business, the issuance of additional capital stock, mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions.
none of the liberty entities own any interest in us. mr. malone beneficially owns stock of liberty media representing approximately 46% of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock, owns shares representing approximately 28% of the aggregate voting power of liberty global, shares representing approximately 38% of the aggregate voting power of liberty interactive, shares representing approximately 46% of the aggregate voting power of liberty broadband and shares representing approximately 21% of the aggregate voting power (other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors) of our outstanding stock. mr. malone controls approximately 28% of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our eight common stock directors, assuming that the preferred stock owned by advance/newhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock. our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities own stock and stock incentives of the liberty entities and own our stock and stock incentives.
these ownership interests and/or business positions could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us, advance/newhouse and/or the liberty entities. for example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we, on the one hand, or advance/newhouse and/or one or more of the liberty entities, on the other hand, consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other.
the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders. likewise, those persons who serve in similar capacities at advance/newhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies. therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies, and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest.
31
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. these provisions include the following:
•   authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a series b that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a series a-1 that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a series c that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;
•   authorizing the series a-1 convertible preferred stock with special voting rights, which prohibits us from taking any of the following actions, among others, without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such stock:
•   increasing the number of members of the board of directors above ten;
•   making any material amendment to our charter or by-laws;
•   engaging in a merger, consolidation or other business combination with any other entity; and
•   appointing or removing our chairman of the board or our chief executive officer;
•   authorizing the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;
•   classifying our common stock directors with staggered three-year terms and having three directors elected by the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;
•   limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;
•   prohibiting stockholder action by written consent (subject to certain exceptions), thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;
•   establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;
•   requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 80% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our charter;
•   requiring the consent of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding series b common stock (voting as a separate class) to certain share distributions and other corporate actions in which the voting power of the series b common stock would be diluted by, for example, issuing shares having multiple votes per share as a dividend to holders of series a common stock; and
•   the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.
we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover. while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us, the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us.
holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock.
principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. under delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. as a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock. under the principles of delaware law referred to above, stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders.
32
if advance/newhouse were to exercise its registration rights, it may cause a significant decline in our stock price, even if our business is doing well.
advance/newhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advance/newhouse. advance/newhouse's series a-1 convertible preferred stock is currently convertible into nine shares of our series a common stock and advance/newhouse's series c-1 convertible preferred stock is convertible into 19.3648 shares of our series c common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. the registration rights, which are immediately exercisable, are transferable with the sale or transfer by advance/newhouse of blocks of shares representing 10% or more of the preferred stock it holds. the exercise of the registration rights, and subsequent sale of possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
john c. malone and advance/newhouse each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders.
for corporate matters other than the election of directors, mr. malone and advance/newhouse each beneficially own shares of our stock representing approximately 21% and 24%, respectively, of the aggregate voting power represented by our outstanding stock. with respect to the election of directors, mr. malone controls approximately 28% of the aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight common stock directors (assuming that the convertible preferred stock owned by advance/newhouse (the "a/n preferred stock") has not been converted into shares of our common stock). the a/n preferred stock carries with it the right to designate three preferred stock directors to our board (subject to certain conditions) but does not carry voting rights with respect to the election of the eight common stock directors. also, under the terms of the a/n preferred stock, advance/newhouse has special voting rights as to certain enumerated matters, including material amendments to the restated charter and bylaws, fundamental changes in our business, mergers and other business combinations, certain acquisitions and dispositions and future issuances of capital stock. although there is no stockholder agreement, voting agreement or any similar arrangement between mr. malone and advance/newhouse, by virtue of their respective holdings, mr. malone and advance/newhouse each have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. this section provides additional information regarding our businesses, current developments, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, contractual commitments and critical accounting policies.
business overview we are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including pay-tv, free to air ("fta") and broadcast television, authenticated applications, digital distribution arrangements and content licensing agreements. our portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as discovery channel, our most widely distributed global brand, tlc, animal planet, food network, hgtv, id, motortrend (previously known as velocity and known as turbo outside of the u.s.) and eurosport, a leading sports entertainment pay-tv programmer across europe and asia. we operate production studios, and prior to the sale of our education business on april 30, 2018, we sold curriculum-based education products and services (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
our objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales and create or reposition branded channels and businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we are extending content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, on-line streaming, mobile devices, vod and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, dth satellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors, that deliver our content to their customers.
our content spans genres including survival, exploration, sports, general entertainment, home, food and travel, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health and kids. we have an extensive library of high-definition content and own rights to much of our content and footage, which enables us to exploit our library to launch brands and services into new markets quickly. our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms.
although the company utilizes certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations in two reportable segments: u.s. networks, consisting principally of domestic television networks and digital distribution arrangements, and international networks, consisting primarily of international television networks and digital distribution arrangements. in addition, education and other consists principally of a production studio, and prior to the sale of the education business on april 30, 2018, curriculum-based education products and services (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) our segment presentation aligns with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make strategic and operating decisions, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments. for further discussion of our company, segments in which we do business, and our content development activities and revenues, see our business overview set forth in item 1, "business" in this annual report on form 10-k.
results of operations - 2018 vs. 2017
the discussion below compares our actual and pro forma combined results for the twelve months ended december 31, 2018 to the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, respectively, as if the own and mtg transactions and the acquisition of scripps networks (collectively, "the transactions") occurred on january 1, 2017. management believes reviewing our actual operating results in addition to combined pro forma results is useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of our businesses. this information has not been prepared in accordance with gaap, is not intended to be a substitute for or superior to gaap. please see our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. our combined u.s. networks, international networks and corporate and inter-segment eliminations pro forma information is based on the historical operating results of the respective businesses as applicable to each segment and includes adjustments directly attributable to the transactions as if they had occurred on january 1, 2017, such as:
1.   the impact of the purchase price allocation to the fair value of assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests, such as intangible amortization;
2.   adjustments to remove items associated with the transactions that will not have a continuing impact on the combined entity, such as transaction costs and the impact of employee retention agreements; and
3.   changes to align accounting policies
41
adjustments do not include costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the acquired businesses since january 1, 2017 and should not be taken as indicative of the company's future consolidated results of operations.
actual amounts for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 include the results of operations for the discovery and scripps networks, own and mtg businesses for the period since each respective transaction. scripps networks was acquired on march 6, 2018, own was consolidated on november 30, 2017 and mtg was consolidated on september 25, 2017.

revenues distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks, supplemented by revenue earned from svod content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution. distribution revenue increased 31%, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. excluding the impact of the transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 3%. increases at international networks were primarily driven by increases in subscribers to our linear networks and higher digital subscription revenues and increases in pricing in europe and latin america. increases at u.s. networks were principally attributable to an increase in contractual affiliate rates, which was partially offset by a decline in subscribers and, to a lesser extent, the timing of content deliveries under svod arrangements.
advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets and economic conditions. these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. advertising revenue increased 79%, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. excluding the impact of the transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 3%. the increases were due to continued monetization of our digital content offerings, an increase in pricing at u.s. networks, and the olympics.
other revenue increased 54%, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. excluding the impact of the transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, other revenue increased 8%. the increases were primarily due to sublicensing of olympics sports rights to broadcast networks throughout europe, partially offset by the education and other revenue that decreased 66% following the disposition of the education business on april 30, 2018. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
revenue for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading "segment results of operations."
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 48%, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. the company's principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. content expense includes television series, television specials, films, sporting events and digital products. the costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of film costs, participation costs, exploitation costs and manufacturing costs. content rights expense excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations was $2.9 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. excluding the impact of the transactions and foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenue increased 5%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis, costs of revenues increased 2%. the increases were primarily due to spending on the olympics at international networks, partially offset by the impact of higher content impairment expenses recorded in the prior year at u.s. networks and the impact of the disposition of the education business. on a pro forma combined basis and excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, content expense was $3.0 billion for each of the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. content impairment is generally a component of costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. however, during the year ended december 31, 2018, content impairments of $405 million were reflected as a component of restructuring and other charges as a result of the strategic programming changes following the acquisition of scripps networks. no content impairments were recorded as a component of restructuring and other charges during the year ended december 31, 2017.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 48%, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. excluding the impact of the transactions, directly related third-party transaction and planned integration costs and foreign currency fluctuations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6%, primarily due to increased marketing spend at international networks, increased share-based compensation expense, charge-backs to an equity method investee in the prior year that is now consolidated, and increases in technology costs and tax advisory fees, partially offset by decreases at education and other following the disposition of the education business on april 30, 2018. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were largely consistent with the prior year.
impairment of goodwill no goodwill impairment expense was recorded during the year ended december 31, 2018. goodwill impairment expense of $1.3 billion was recognized during the year ended december 31, 2017. (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
43
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. depreciation and amortization increased $1.1 billion, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. on a pro forma combined basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $249 million, primarily due to pro forma amortization in 2017 related to the ad revenue backlog intangible, which had a one-year useful life and was fully amortized on a pro forma basis in 2017.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased $675 million, primarily as a result of content impairments associated with changes in programming strategies, involuntary severance actions associated with the integration of scripps networks, costs associated with the termination of long-term programming arrangements, and lease exit costs. (see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) on a pro forma combined basis, restructuring and other charges increased $685 million. we expect to incur additional restructuring and integration expenses related to employee and contract terminations, relocation from the company's silver spring headquarters to new york city, and content costs.
(gain) loss on disposition we recorded an $84 million gain during the year ended december 31, 2018 due to the sale of a controlling stake in the education business on april 30, 2018, compared with a loss of $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 due to the disposition of the raw and betty production studios. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense interest expense increased $254 million, primarily due to interest accrued on higher debt balances, including the senior notes issued on september 21, 2017 and term loans outstanding from march 6, 2018 through september 30, 2018. the senior notes and term loans were used to effect the acquisition of scripps networks. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss on extinguishment of debt on march 13, 2017, we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $650 million and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on march 13, 2017. as a result, we recognized a $54 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included $50 million for premiums to par value, $2 million of non-cash write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, $1 million for the write-off of the original issue discount of these senior notes and $1 million accrued for other third-party fees. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss from equity investees, net the loss from our equity method investees decreased $148 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily due to a reduction in losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy, and to a lesser extent, inclusion of equity earnings as a result of the acquisition of scripps networks, partially offset by the absence of earnings from the company's equity method investment in own and impairments of $29 million. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

total other expense, net increased $10 million in 2018 compared to 2017. during the year ended december 31, 2018 we recorded losses on common stock investments with readily determinable fair value due to the adoption of the recognition and measurement of financial instruments guidance on january 1, 2018, which requires us to record gains and losses on equity investments with readily determinable fair values in other expense, net. previously, unrealized gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income. the increase in foreign currency losses for the year ended december 31, 2018 was mostly related to remeasurement of net monetary assets and transactions associated with the polish zloty, the euro and other european currencies, partially offset by a reduction in losses associated with the british pound. we recorded gains on derivative instruments for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to losses for the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily due to losses of $98 million recorded during the prior year on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollar-denominated senior notes on september 21, 2017 and, to a lesser extent, gains recorded in the current year on the equity collar used to mitigate the risk of market fluctuations with respect to 50% of the lionsgate shares held by the company and foreign currency swaps. (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) on november 30, 2017, the company acquired from harpo a controlling interest in own. we recognized a remeasurement gain of $33 million to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of previously held 49.50% equity interest.

income tax expense was $341 million and $176 million and our effective tax rate was 33% and (128)% for 2018 and 2017, respectively.  during 2018, the increase in the income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in income, a reduction in benefits from investment tax credits from our renewable energy investments, the effect of foreign operations, which included the establishment of valuation allowances and write-offs of deferred tax assets, and elimination of the domestic production activity deduction, partially offset by the lower u.s. federal statutory income tax rate, a decrease in expense for uncertain tax positions, and a tax benefit from tcja rate change on the deferred tax liability recomputation as a result of u.s. legislative changes that extended the accelerated deduction of qualified film productions.
in connection with the acquisition of scripps networks, we recorded reserves in purchase accounting totaling $110 million for foreign tax matters claimed by tax authorities that are currently pending resolution. after the purchase accounting measurement period closes on march 5, 2019, any adjustment to these estimated amounts resulting from their resolution will affect net income in the period resolved.

segment results of operations - 2018 vs. 2017
we evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda. adjusted oibda is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and other charges, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, (vi) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios, and (vii) third-party transaction costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of scripps networks. we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. we exclude mark-to-market share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and scripps networks acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their impact on comparability between periods. we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives.
adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

(a)  selling, general and administrative expenses exclude mark-to-market share-based compensation and scripps networks transaction and integration costs due to their impact on comparability between periods.
effective january 1, 2019, our definition of adjusted oibda was modified to exclude all share-based compensation, whereas only mark-to-market share-based compensation is excluded for each of the periods presented herein. during 2018, the company began granting a higher percentage of equity classified awards (in lieu of liability classified awards, which require mark-to-market accounting) under its stock incentive plans, and expects to continue this action in future periods. since most equity classified awards are non-cash expenses not entirely under management control, the company has elected to exclude all share-based compensation from adjusted oibda beginning in 2019. the revised definition of adjusted oibda will be used by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating segment performance in 2019.
the following table presents adjusted oibda as historically reported and under the revised definition:

revenues distribution revenue increased 52%, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. excluding the impact of the transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, distribution revenue increased 1% reflecting the impact of an increase in contractual affiliate rates, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and to a lesser extent, the timing of content deliveries under svod arrangements. on a pro forma combined basis, total portfolio subscribers for december 2018 were 4% lower than december 2017 and subscribers to our fully distributed networks were consistent with the prior year, due to additional carriage toward the end of the year, which offset the general trend of subscriber declines.
advertising revenue increased $2.0 billion, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. excluding the impact of the transactions and on a pro forma combined basis, advertising revenue increased 3%. the increases were due to the continued monetization of our digital content offerings and an increase in pricing, partially offset by the impact of audience declines on our linear networks.
other revenue increased 77%, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. excluding the impact of the transactions, other revenue decreased 27% due to lower program and merchandising sales. on a pro forma combined basis, other revenue in 2018 was largely consistent with 2017.
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 91%, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. excluding the impact of the transactions, costs of revenues decreased 4% and on a pro forma combined basis, costs of revenues decreased 5%. the decreases were primarily due to higher content impairment expenses recorded in costs of revenues in 2017. content expense was $1.5 billion and $776 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. pro forma combined content expense was $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. content impairment is generally a component of costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. however, during the year ended december 31, 2018, content impairments of $221 million were reflected as a component of restructuring and other charges as a result of the strategic programming changes following the acquisition of scripps networks. no content impairments were recorded as a component of restructuring and other charges during the year ended december 31, 2017.

selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses increased $611 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. excluding the impact of the transactions, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4% as expenses in the prior year were reduced by charge-backs to an equity method investee that is now consolidated. on a pro forma combined basis, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3%, primarily as a result of reductions in personnel costs due to restructuring.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda increased 73%, primarily due to the impact of the transactions. excluding the impact of the transactions, adjusted oibda increased 3% driven by an increase in revenues and decrease in costs of revenues, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. on a pro forma combined basis, adjusted oibda increased 8%, driven by an increase in revenues combined with decreases in costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.

costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 29%, mostly due to the impact of the acquisition of scripps networks. excluding the impact of the acquisition of scripps networks and foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenues increased 12%. on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenues increased 11%. the increases were primarily attributable to spending on the olympics, partially offset by content synergies from the integration of scripps networks. content rights expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, content rights expense was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. content impairment is generally a component of costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. however, during the year ended december 31, 2018, content impairments of $184 million were reflected as a component of restructuring and other charges as a result of the strategic programming changes following the acquisition of scripps networks. no content impairments were recorded as a component of restructuring and other charges during the year ended december 31, 2017.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21%, mostly due to the impact of the acquisition of scripps networks. excluding the impact of the acquisition of scripps networks and foreign currency fluctuations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7%. on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2%. the increases were due to increased marketing spend, particularly related to our digital distribution offerings. on a pro forma combined basis, the increase in costs was partially offset by cost savings from the integration of scripps networks.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda increased 25%, primarily due to the acquisition of scripps networks. excluding the impact of the acquisition of scripps networks and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted oibda increased 2%. on a pro forma combined basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted oibda increased 7%. the increases reflect the growth in revenues, which outpaced the increases in costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.
the impairment of goodwill reflected above for international networks is a portion of the total goodwill impairment recorded for the european reporting unit during 2017. the remaining portion of the impairment of $838 million is a component of corporate and inter-segment eliminations. the presentation of goodwill impairment is consistent with the financial reports that are reviewed by the company's ceo. goodwill has been allocated from corporate assets to reporting units within the international networks segment.

corporate operations primarily consist of executive management, administrative support services, substantially all of our share-based compensation and transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of scripps networks.
the adjusted oibda loss increased 23% in 2018 as compared to 2017. excluding the impact of the transactions and foreign currency fluctuations, the adjusted oibda loss increased 16%, due to an increase in selling, general and administrative costs driven by increases in technology costs, tax advisory fees, and share-based compensation. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis, the adjusted oibda loss was largely consistent with the prior year as the aforementioned increases were offset by a reduction in personnel costs as a result of restructuring and the integration of scripps networks.
the impairment of goodwill presented above for corporate and inter-segment eliminations is a portion of the total goodwill impairment recorded for the european reporting unit during 2017. the remaining portion of the impairment of $489 million is a component of our international networks segment. the presentation of goodwill impairment is consistent with the financial reports that are reviewed by the company's ceo. goodwill has been allocated from corporate assets to reporting units within corporate and inter-segment eliminations.
items impacting comparability from time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods. in comparing the financial results for the years 2018 and 2017, in addition to the transactions, the company has identified foreign currency as one such item, as noted below.
foreign currency the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our results. for example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis (ex-fx), in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-fx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.

the ex-fx change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. the ex-fx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process (the "2018 baseline rate"), and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2018 baseline rate. in addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-fx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. selling, general and administrative expense, as presented below, excludes mark-to-market share-based compensation and scripps networks transaction and integration costs due to their impact on comparability between periods.
the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our consolidated results is as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

advertising revenue increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase for our u.s. networks was primarily due to pricing increases and continued monetization of our go platform, partially offset by lower audience delivery due to continued linear distribution audience universe declines. international networks' increases were primarily due to increased volume across key markets in europe, particularly southern europe and germany, and latin america. the increase was partially offset by declines in ad sales due to lower pricing and volume in asia.
53
other revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to the formation and consolidation of the mtg joint venture (then known as vten) during the third quarter of the current year. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 9%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, own and mtg transactions and the group nine transaction, costs of revenues increased 7% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to increased spending on content at our international networks segment, particularly sports rights and associated production costs. content amortization was $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, own and mtg transactions, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to transaction costs for the scripps networks acquisition and integration costs of $79 million, including the $35 million charge associated with the modification of advance/newhouse's preferred stock. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
impairment of goodwill goodwill impairment expense of $1.3 billion was recognized during the year ended december 31, 2017. (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was consistent for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared with the prior period as capital spending has remained consistent over the periods.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased $17 million. the increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related termination costs for voluntary and involuntary severance actions. (see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss (gain) on disposition the change in loss (gain) on disposition was $67 million. we recorded a $4 million loss for the year ended december 31, 2017 due to the sale of the raw and betty production studios on april 28, 2017, compared with a gain of $63 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the gain on disposition recorded for the year ended december 31, 2016 is comprised of the $50 million gain for the deconsolidation of our digital networks business seeker and sourcefed studios in connection with the group nine transaction and the $13 million gain due to the disposition of our radio businesses in the nordics. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense interest expense increased $122 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to costs incurred for the unsecured bridge loan commitment as well as interest accrued on the senior notes issued on september 21, 2017 for the financing of the scripps networks acquisition. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss on extinguishment of debt on march 13, 2017, we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $650 million and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on march 13, 2017. as a result, we recognized a $54 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included $50 million for premiums to par value, $2 million of non-cash write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, $1 million for the write-off of the original issue discount of the existing senior notes and $1 million accrued for other third-party fees. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
54
loss from equity investees, net losses from our equity method investees increased $173 million primarily due to losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy, partially offset by increases in earnings at own and decreases in losses at all3media. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

other expense increased $114 million in 2017. we recorded foreign currency losses during 2017 compared to foreign currency gains during 2016, mostly due to exchange rate changes on the u.s. dollar compared with the british pound that impacted foreign currency monetary assets. increases in losses from derivative instruments primarily resulted from losses of $98 million on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollar-denominated senior notes, which were settled on september 21, 2017. the interest rate contracts did not receive hedging designation. the losses were partially offset by various other items, including a gain of $17 million on previously settled interest rate contracts for which the hedged issuance of debt is considered remote following the issuance of the senior notes on september 21, 2017. (see note 9 and note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) on november 30, 2017, the company acquired from harpo a controlling interest in own. we recognized a remeasurement gain to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of our previously held 49.50% equity interest. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

income tax expense was $176 million and $453 million and our effective tax rate was (128)% and 27% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. during 2017, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of non-cash goodwill impairment charges that are non-deductible for tax purposes. thereafter, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to investment tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments, and to a lesser extent, the domestic production activity deduction benefit, the allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions, and the impact of the tcja (see note 18 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements). the benefits were partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2017. in 2016, we favorably resolved multi-year state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions that did not recur in 2017.

revenues distribution revenues increased 5%. excluding the impact of the own transaction, distribution revenues increased 4%, primarily driven by increases in affiliate fee rates and increases in svod revenue due to the timing of content deliveries. these increases were partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers. total portfolio subscribers declined 5% for the year ended december 31, 2017, while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3% for the same period.
advertising revenue increased 3%. excluding the impact of the own and mtg transactions and the group nine transaction, advertising revenue increased 2% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to pricing increases and continued monetization of our go platform, partially offset by lower audience delivery due to continued linear distribution audience universe declines.
other revenue increased 30% primarily due to the formation and consolidation of the mtg joint venture (then known as vten) during the third quarter of the current year. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2017. excluding the impact of own and mtg transactions and the group nine transaction, costs of revenue increased 1%. content amortization was $752 million and $716 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4%. excluding the impact of own and mtg transactions and the group nine transaction, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1% for the year ended december 31, 2017. increased spending on viewer research was offset by decreases in personnel and marketing costs.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda increased 5% primarily due to increases in distribution and advertising revenues, partially offset by increases in costs of revenues. excluding the impact of the own and mtg transactions and the group nine transaction, adjusted oibda also increased 5%.

revenues distribution revenue increased 11%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 9%. the increase was mostly due to increases in contractual rates in europe following further investment in sports content, and to a lesser extent increases in latin america due to increases in rates offset by decreases in subscribers. contributions from other distribution revenues also contributed slightly to growth. other distribution revenues were comprised of content deliveries under licensing agreements. these increases were partially offset by decreases in contractual rates in asia.
advertising revenue increased 4%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 3%. the increase was primarily driven by increases in volume across key markets in europe, particularly southern europe and germany, and latin america. the increase was partially offset by declines in ad sales due to lower pricing and volume in asia.
other revenue remained consistent with the prior year.
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 15%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenues increased 12%. the increase was mostly attributable to increased spending on content, particularly sports rights and associated production costs. content amortization was $1.1 billion and $976 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses remained consistent with the prior year.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda increased 3% as increases in distribution and advertising revenues were offset by increases in costs of revenues, related to content expense.

the decrease in mark-to-market share-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in discovery's stock price in 2017 compared to 2016. changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for stock appreciation rights ("sars") and performance-based restricted stock units ("prsus"). by contrast, stock options and service-based restricted stock units ("rsus") are fair valued at grant date and amortized over their vesting period without mark-to-market adjustments. the expense associated with stock options and rsus is included in adjusted oibda as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.
items impacting comparability from time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods. in comparing the financial results for the years 2017 and 2016, the company has identified foreign currency as one such item, as noted below. the company also has various acquisitions and dispositions that impact the comparability of our results. to the extent that the transaction materially impacts a particular item or segment, it may be discussed in the relevant section above (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements).
foreign currency the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results. for example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis ("ex-fx"), in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap, provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-fx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.

the ex-fx change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. the ex-fx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process, (the "2016 baseline rate") and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2016 baseline rate. in addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-fx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below (in millions). results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

on september 21, 2017, dcl issued $500 million principal amount of 2.200% senior notes due 2019, $1.20 billion principal amount of 2.950% senior notes due 2023, $1.70 billion principal amount of 3.950% senior notes due 2028, $1.25 billion principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2037, $1.25 billion principal amount of 5.200% senior notes due 2047 (collectively, the "senior fixed rate notes") and $400 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2019 (the "senior floating rate notes" and, together with the senior fixed rate notes, the "usd notes"). interest on the senior fixed rate notes is payable on march 20 and september 20 of each year. interest on the senior floating rate notes is payable on march 20, june 20, september 20 and december 20 of each year. the usd notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company. on september 21, 2017, dcl also issued £400 million principal amount ($540 million at issuance based on the exchange rate of $1.35 per pound at september 21, 2017) of 2.500% senior notes due 2024 (the "sterling notes"). interest on the sterling notes is payable on september 20 of each year. the proceeds received by dcl from the usd notes and the sterling notes were net of a $11 million issuance discount and $57 million of debt issuance costs.
on march 13, 2017, dcl issued $450 million principal amount of 3.800% senior notes due march 13, 2024 (the "2017 usd notes") and an additional $200 million principal amount of its existing 4.900% senior notes due march 11, 2026 (the "2016 usd notes"). interest on the 2017 usd notes is payable semi-annually on march 13 and september 13 of each year. interest on the 2016 usd notes is payable semi-annually on march 11 and september 11 of each year. the proceeds received by dcl from the 2017 usd notes were net of a $1 million issuance discount and $4 million of debt issuance costs. the proceeds received by dcl from the 2016 usd notes included a $10 million issuance premium and were net of $2 million of debt issuance costs.
dcl used the proceeds from the offerings of the 2017 usd notes and the 2016 usd notes to repurchase $600 million aggregate principal amount of dcl's 5.050% senior notes due 2020 and 5.625% senior notes due 2019 in a cash tender offer. the repurchase resulted in a pretax loss on extinguishment of debt of $54 million for the three months ended march 31, 2017, which is presented as a separate line item on the company's consolidated statements of operations and recognized as a component of financing cash outflows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. the loss included $50 million for premiums to par value, $2 million of non-cash write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, $1 million for the write-off of the original issue discount of these senior notes and $1 million accrued for other third-party fees.
revolving credit facility we have access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, as amended on august 11, 2017. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2018, the company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $225 million at a weighted average interest rate of 3.82%. the revolving credit facility agreement provides for a maturity date of august 11, 2022 and the option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods. all obligations of dcl and the other borrowers under the revolving credit facility are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by discovery.
the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility (the "credit agreement") contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, investments, indebtedness, dispositions, affiliate transactions, dividends and restricted payments. dcl, its subsidiaries and discovery are also subject to a limitation on mergers, liquidation and disposals of all or substantially all of their assets. the credit agreement, as amended on august 11, 2017, continues to require dcl to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 3:00 to 1:00 and now requires a consolidated leverage ratio of financial covenant of 5.50 to 1.00, with step-downs to 5.00 to 1.00 in the first year after the closing of the acquisition of scripps networks and 4.50 to 1.00 in the second year after the closing. as of december 31, 2018, discovery, dcl and the other borrowers were in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the credit agreement.
62
term loans on august 11, 2017, dcl entered into a delayed draw and unsecured term loan credit facility (the "term loans"), with a three-year tranche and a five-year tranche, each with a principal amount of up to $1 billion. the term of each delayed draw loan commenced on march 6, 2018 when discovery borrowed the full amount of both tranches to finance a portion of the acquisition of scripps networks. as of december 31, 2018, the company had used cash from operations and borrowings under the commercial paper program to repay in full the term loan borrowings.
commercial paper under our commercial paper program and subject to market conditions, dcl may issue unsecured commercial paper notes guaranteed by the company from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $1 billion. the maturities of these notes vary but may not exceed 397 days. the notes may be issued at a discount or at par, and interest rates vary based on market conditions and the credit rating assigned to the notes at the time of issuance. as of december 31, 2018, we did not have outstanding commercial paper borrowings. borrowings under the commercial paper program would reduce the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility arrangement referenced above.
we repay our senior notes, revolving credit facility, term loans, and commercial paper as required, and accordingly these sources of cash also require use of our cash.
•   dispositions on april 30, 2018, the company sold an 88% controlling equity stake in its education business to francisco partners for cash of $113 million and recorded a gain of $84 million upon disposition. discovery retained a 12% ownership interest in the education business, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   real estate strategy and relocation of global headquarters the company enters into multi-year lease arrangements for transponders, office space, studio facilities and other equipment. most leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration. on january 9, 2018, the company announced plans to relocate its global headquarters from silver spring, maryland ("the silver spring property") to new york city in 2019. during the third quarter, the company entered into a sale-lease back transaction for the silver spring property. the lease is classified as an operating lease. as a result of the sale, the company received net proceeds of $68 million and recognized an impairment loss of $12 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 which is reflected in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations.
uses of cash our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, repurchases of our capital stock, income taxes, personnel costs, principal and interest on our outstanding senior notes, and funding for various equity method and other investments.
•   investments and business combinations scripps networks acquisition on march 6, 2018, discovery completed the acquisition of scripps networks (the "acquisition of scripps networks"). the company elected to exercise in full the cash top-up option. the acquisition of scripps networks consideration consisted of (i) for scripps networks shareholders who did not make an election or elected the mixed consideration, $65.82 in cash and 1.0584 shares of discovery series c common stock for each scripps networks share, (ii) for scripps networks shareholders that elected the cash consideration, $90.00 in cash for each scripps networks share and (iii) for scripps networks shareholders that elected the stock consideration, 3.9392 shares of discovery series c common stock for each scripps networks share, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement and plan of merger by and among discovery, scripps networks and skylight merger sub, inc., dated july 30, 2017 (the "merger agreement").
the consideration for the acquisition of scripps networks totaled $12 billion, including cash of $8.8 billion and stock of $3.2 billion based on share prices as of march 6, 2018.
in addition, we assumed $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of scripps networks 2.75% senior notes due 2019, 2.8% senior notes due 2020, 3.5% senior notes due 2022, 3.9% senior notes due 2024 and 3.95% senior notes due 2025. on april 3, 2018, we completed a transaction in which most of scripps network outstanding debt was exchanged for dcl senior notes. in connection with that transaction, scripps networks interactive, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the dcl senior notes.

•   other investments our uses of cash have included investment in equity method investments and equity investments without readily determinable fair value. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we provide funding to our investees from time to time. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we contributed $17 million in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy.
•   redeemable noncontrolling interest due to business combinations, we also have redeemable equity balances of $415 million, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to us. (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   content acquisition we plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content. additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
•   common stock repurchases the company's stock repurchase program, which authorized management to purchase shares of the company's common stock from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase or other derivative arrangements as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to stock price, business and market conditions and other factors, expired on october 8, 2017, and we have not repurchased any shares of common stock since then. as of december 31, 2018, the company had repurchased 3 million and 164 million shares of our series a and series c common stock over the life of the program for the aggregate purchase price of $171 million and $6.6 billion, respectively. we have funded our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt. in the future, should our board of directors authorize a new stock repurchase program, we may also choose to fund stock repurchases through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and future financing transactions. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
•   income taxes and interest we expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we made cash payments of $389 million and $740 million for income taxes and interest on our outstanding debt, respectively.
•   debt we have $1.8 billion of outstanding senior notes due in 2019, of which $411 million of our 5.625% senior notes due in august 2019 will be redeemed on march 21, 2019. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) as of december 31, 2018, the company had repaid in full $2 billion in term loans using cash from operations and borrowings under the company's commercial paper program.
•   restructuring and other our uses of cash include restructuring and other charges related to contract terminations and employee terminations. these charges result from activities to integrate scripps networks and establish an efficient cost structure. as of december 31, 2018, we had restructuring liabilities of $108 million related to employee and contract terminations. (see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we expect to incur additional restructuring and integration expenses related to employee and contract terminations, relocation from the silver spring property to new york city, and costs related to content.
•   share-based compensation we expect to continue to make payments for vested cash-settled share-based awards. actual amounts expensed and payable for cash-settled awards are dependent on future fair value calculations, which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price or changes in the number of awards outstanding. during 2018, no payments were made for cash-settled share-based awards. as of december 31, 2018, liabilities totaled $54 million for outstanding liability-classified share-based compensation awards, of which $23 million was classified as current. (see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased $947 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to increases in income following the acquisition of scripps networks, partially offset by cash paid for interest and spending on content, including sports rights.
cash provided by operating activities increased $249 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to a $253 million decrease in cash paid for taxes. the decrease in cash paid for taxes, net, for the year ended december 31, 2017 is mostly due to the tax impact from our investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy. (see note 5 and note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) declines in working capital, primarily due to changes in accounts receivable, were offset by a decrease in the net negative effect of foreign currency and increases in payables.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased $8.0 billion for the twelve months ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of scripps networks, partially offset by a reduction in payments for investments. see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
cash flows used in investing activities increased $377 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was mostly attributable to an increase in payments for investments of $172 million, including renewable energy projects and payments for derivative instruments of $98 million that did not receive hedge accounting, but economically hedged pricing risk for the senior notes issued september 21, 2017.
financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities decreased $6.2 billion for the twelve months ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2017. the decrease was primarily attributable to net borrowings in 2017 used to finance the acquisition of scripps networks, offset by decreases in cash used to buy back stock and increases in issuances of commercial paper.
cash flows provided by financing activities increased $7.1 billion for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes which were used to finance the acquisition of scripps networks (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and a decrease in repurchases of stock of $771 million, offset by an increase in principal repayments of debt.

(a) interest on senior notes is paid annually, semi-annually or quarterly. our senior notes outstanding as of december 31, 2018 had interest rates that ranged from 1.90% to 6.35% and will mature between 2019 and 2047.
we expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months. our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics, such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.
as of december 31, 2018, we held $242 million of our $986 million of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries. the tcja enacted on december 22, 2017 featured a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings. the u.s. taxation of these amounts, notwithstanding, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the u.s. however, if these funds are needed in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay non-u.s. taxes to repatriate them. the determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.
additional information regarding the changes in our outstanding indebtedness and the significant terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility and outstanding indebtedness is discussed in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements obligations as of december 31, 2018, our significant contractual obligations, including related payments due by period, were as follows (in millions).

the above table does not include certain long-term obligations as the timing or the amount of the payments cannot be predicted. for example, as of december 31, 2018, we have recorded $415 million for redeemable equity (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), although we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of any payment. the current portion of the liability for cash-settled share-based compensation awards was $23 million as of december 31, 2018. additionally, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above table because we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $378 million as of december 31, 2018.
the above table also does not include dcl's revolving credit facility that, during the year ended december 31, 2018, allowed dcl and certain designated foreign subsidiaries of dcl to borrow up to $2.5 billion, including a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $50 million sublimit for swingline loans. borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program discussed below. as of december 31, 2018, the revolving credit facility agreement provided for a maturity date of august 11, 2022 and the option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods.
from time to time we may provide our equity method investees additional funding that has not been committed to as of december 31, 2018 based on unforeseen investee opportunities or cash flow needs. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
long-term debt principal payments on long-term debt reflect the repayment of our outstanding senior notes, at face value, assuming repayment will occur upon maturity. interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are projected based on their contractual rate and maturity.
capital lease obligations we acquire satellite transponders and other equipment through multi-year capital lease arrangements. principal payments on capital lease obligations reflect amounts due under our capital lease agreements. interest payments on our outstanding capital lease obligations are based on the stated or implied rate in our capital lease agreements.
operating lease obligations we obtain office space and equipment under multi-year lease arrangements. most operating leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration. payments for operating leases represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration.
purchase obligations content purchase obligations include commitments and liabilities associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks. production contracts generally require: purchase of a specified number of episodes; payments over the term of the license; and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. if the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation. the commitments disclosed above exclude content liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. we expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs.
other purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing research, employment contracts, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. the company has contracts that do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30-day to 60-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period. amounts related to employment contracts include base compensation and do not include compensation contingent on future events.
67
put rights the company has granted put rights to certain consolidated subsidiaries. harpo, goldentree, hasbro, inc. ("hasbro") and j:com have the right to require the company to purchase their remaining noncontrolling interests in own, mtg, discovery family and discovery japan, respectively. the company recorded the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in the equity associated with the put rights for own, mtg, discovery family and discovery japan as a component of redeemable noncontrolling interest in the amounts of $58 million, $121 million, $206 million and $30 million, respectively. (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
pension obligations we sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan ("pension plan") that covers certain u.s.-based employees. we also have a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan ("serp").
contractual commitments summarized in the contractual obligations table include payments to meet minimum funding requirements of our pension plan in 2019 and estimated benefit payments for our serp. we do not anticipate contributing any cash to fund our pension plan in 2019. payments for the serp have been estimated over a ten-year period. accordingly, the amounts in the over five years column include estimated payments for the 2024 through 2028 periods. while benefit payments under these plans are expected to continue beyond 2028, we believe it is not practicable to estimate payments beyond this period.
non-controlling interest the food network and cooking channel are operated and organized under the terms of the tv food network partnership (the "partnership"). the company and a non-controlling owner hold interests in the partnership. during the fourth quarter of 2016, the partnership agreement was extended and specifies a dissolution date of december 31, 2020. if the term of the partnership is not extended prior to that date, the partnership agreement permits the company, as holder of 80% of the applicable votes, to reconstitute the partnership and continue its business. if for some reason the partnership is not continued, it will be required to limit its activities to winding up, settling debts, liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in item 303(a)(4) of regulation s-k) that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
related party transactions in the ordinary course of business, we enter into transactions with related parties, primarily our equity method investees and liberty media, liberty global, liberty interactive and liberty broadband (together, the "liberty entities"). information regarding transactions and amounts with related parties is discussed in note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
new accounting and reporting pronouncements we adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2018. information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k and accompanying notes. management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to reporting our financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company. we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies:
•   revenue recognition;
•   goodwill and intangible assets;
•   income taxes;
•   business combinations (see note 3);
•   content rights; and
•   equity method investments.
with respect to our accounting policy for goodwill, we further supplement disclosures in note 2 with the following:
goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments (the component level). reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management. components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics. our reporting units are as follows: u.s. networks, europe, latin america, and asia-pacific.
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of november 30 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of fair value of each reporting unit if a quantitative test is performed. if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required.
during the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units. this assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of the results of the company's most recent quantitative impairment test, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key personnel and the company's share price. based on this assessment, the company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying values, except for its asia-pacific reporting unit.
based on the results of the qualitative assessment, the company performed a quantitative step 1 impairment test (comparison of fair value to carrying value) for its asia-pacific reporting unit, which indicated limited headroom (the excess of fair value over carrying value) of 10%. in performing the step 1 test, the company determined the fair value of its asia-pacific reporting unit by using a combination of discounted cash flow ("dcf") analyses and market-based valuation methodologies. the results of these valuation methodologies were weighted 50% towards the dcf analyses and 50% towards the market-based approach. the models relied on significant judgments and assumptions surrounding general market conditions, short-term growth rates, a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, and detailed management forecasts of future cash flow projections. fair values were determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at a weighted average cost of capital of 12%. during our annual impairment testing, we evaluated the sensitivity of our most critical assumption, the discount rate, and determined that a 100 basis point change in the discount rate selected would not have impacted the test results. additionally, the company could reduce the terminal growth rate from its current 2.5% to 2.0% and the fair value of the asia-pacific reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value. as of december 31, 2018, the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the asia-pacific reporting unit was $188 million. management will continue to monitor this reporting unit for changes in the business environment that could impact recoverability. the recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities. see item 1a, "risk factors" for details on all significant risks that could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its cash flows. additionally, as the asia-pacific reporting unit operates in foreign markets with various functional currencies and has significant u.s. dollar denominated assets, changes in foreign exchange rates that result in strengthening of the u.s. dollar may negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit and the calculation of excess carrying value.

item 1a. risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in the sections below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.
risks related to our business any periods of uncertainty in the global economy and international trade relations, and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries, may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue.
purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies. the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand.
the ic and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both these industries' and their customers' products. while spending on eda products and services has grown in recent years, the current outlook for the semiconductor industry is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on eda products and services, which are a part of our overall sde offering.
while we cannot predict global economic conditions, uncertainty about future political and economic conditions, adverse changes to international trade relationships between countries in which we do business or future decline in corporate or consumer spending could negatively impact our customers' businesses, reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending, including their spending on our products and services, and as a result decrease demand for our products and services. decreased bookings for our products and services, customer bankruptcies, consolidation among our customers, or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenues and financial results. our future business and financial results, including demand for our products and services, are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price. if economic conditions or international trade relationships between countries in which we do business deteriorate in the future, or, in particular, if semiconductor or electronics systems industry revenues do not grow, the ability to export or import products or services by the semiconductor or electronics systems industry is adversely restricted, or our suppliers of our hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays, our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected. even if economic conditions improve for our customers after a period of decline, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to cautious customer research and development spending and our mix of licenses that yield revenue recognized over time.
customer consolidation could affect our operating results.
there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships. as this trend continues, it could make us dependent on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and other contract terms and could increase the portion of our total sales concentration for any single customer. customer consolidation activity could also reduce the demand for our products and services if such customers streamline research and development or operations, reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions. these outcomes could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers' increasing technological requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete.
the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments, rapid changes in industry standards and customer requirements, and frequent introductions and improvements of new products. currently, the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends:
•   changes in the design and manufacturing of ics, including migration to advanced process nodes and three-dimensional transistors, such as finfets, present major challenges to the semiconductor industry, particularly in ic design, design automation, design of manufacturing equipment, and the manufacturing process itself. with migration to advanced process nodes, the industry must adapt to more complex physics and manufacturing challenges such as the need to draw features on silicon that are many times smaller than the wavelength of light used to draw the features via lithography. models of each component's electrical properties and behavior also become more complex as do requisite analysis, design, verification and manufacturing capabilities. novel design tools and methodologies must be invented and enhanced quickly to remain competitive in the design of electronics in the smallest nanometer ranges;
•   the ability to design socs increases the complexity of managing a design that, at the lowest level, is represented by billions of shapes on fabrication masks. in addition, socs typically incorporate microprocessors and digital signal processors that are programmed with software, requiring simultaneous design of the ic and the related software embedded on the ic;
8
•   with the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity, there is an increase in design reuse, or the combining of off-the-shelf design ip with custom logic to create ics or socs. the unavailability of a broad range of high-quality design ip (including our own) that can be reliably incorporated into a customer's design with our software products and services could lead to reduced demand for our products and services;
•   increased technological capability of the fpga, which is a programmable logic chip, creates an alternative to ic implementation for some electronics companies. this could reduce demand for our ic implementation products and services;
•   a growing number of low-cost engineering services businesses could reduce the need for some ic companies to invest in eda products; and
•   adoption of cloud computing technologies with accompanying new business models for an increasing number of software categories.
if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends, we may lose our competitive position, and our products or technologies may become obsolete. to compete successfully, we must develop, acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries. we must provide frequent and relevant updates to our software products in order to provide substantial benefit to the customer throughout the license periods because of the rapid changes in our customers' industries. the market must also accept our new and improved products. our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer. our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing. we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software, hardware platforms and customer preferences. a rapid transition by our customers to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue. we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all, or any, of the customer trends.
competitive pressures may require us to reduce our pricing, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our software, emulation and prototyping hardware and ip. if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products, we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully. any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results. any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. some of our competitors bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. these practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products. if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending, then the reduced revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
our system design enablement strategy requires the development or acquisition of products and expertise in new areas of technology. our inability to develop or acquire these capabilities could impede our ability to address the technical requirements in technology segments which are expected to contribute to our growth.
our sde strategy is meant to increase our business among electronic systems companies, which are now designing their own ics. sde is also meant to increase our business among semiconductor companies, which are increasing their contribution to the end products into which their ics are incorporated. part of this strategy involves addressing the needs of new categories of electronic systems, including hyperscale computing and infrastructure, edge computing, machine learning, augmented reality, virtual reality, internet-of-things and autonomous vehicle sub-systems, where increased investment is expected by our customers. each of these categories requires technologies and expertise that are application-specific. if we are unable to develop or acquire the application-specific technologies and expertise necessary to address the requirements of these categories, it could impede our ability to expand our business in these categories and ultimately affect our future growth.
we have experienced varied operating results, and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition, particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products.
various factors affect our operating results, and some of them are not within our control. our operating results for any period are affected by the mix of products and services sold in a given period and the timing of revenue recognition, particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products. in addition, we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future. also, our cash flows from operating activities have and will continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the timing of our billings, collections, disbursements and tax payments.
a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware business and our ip offerings is recognized upon delivery, and our forecasted revenue results are based, in part, on our expectations of hardware and ip to be delivered in a particular quarter. therefore, changes in hardware and ip bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in software or services bookings, for which revenue is generally recognized over time.
in recent years, we made significant investments to expand our ip offerings through, among other things, research and development and acquisitions. as we continue to expand our ip offerings, a portion of the revenue related to our ip bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed ip to our customers. as a result, costs related to the research and development of the ip may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue.
9
revenue related to our hardware and ip products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware and ip products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers, our customers' willingness to expend capital to deploy our new and existing hardware or ip products in those projects and the availability of our new and existing hardware or ip products for delivery. therefore, our hardware or ip sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply or delivery of our hardware or ip products or our hardware suppliers. moreover, the hardware and ip markets are highly competitive, and our customers may choose to purchase a competitor's hardware or ip product based on cost, performance or other factors. these factors may result in lower revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
a substantial proportion of our software licenses yield revenue recognized over time, which may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods.
we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue, expected business needs and other factors. these expenses and the effect of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment. if we experience a shortfall in bookings, our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to short-term business changes.
the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations (see "critical accounting estimates" under part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations"). such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. changes in those methods, estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.
historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance. if our revenue, operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by us, securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts for new and existing products and technologies and technical sales support. such investments may affect our operating results, and, if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect, our revenue and operating results may suffer.
we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products, technologies and services in response to our customers' increasing technological requirements. such investments may be in related areas, such as technical sales support. these investments may involve significant time, risks and uncertainties, including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate sufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments. we believe that we must continue to invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development efforts and technical sales support to maintain and improve our competitive position. if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, or if customers reduce or slow the need to upgrade or enhance their eda products and design flows, our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
the competition in our industries is substantial, and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries.
the industries in which we do business, including software, hardware, ip and services for enabling the design of electronic products, are highly competitive and require us to identify and develop or acquire innovative and cost-competitive products, integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner. we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries, which could seriously harm our business, operating results or financial condition. factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include:
•   the development by others of competitive products or platforms and engineering services, possibly resulting in a shift of customer preferences away from our products and services and significantly decreased revenue;
•   aggressive pricing competition by some of our competitors may cause us to lose our competitive position, which could result in lower revenues or profitability and could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our software or emulation and prototyping hardware systems products;
•   the challenges of advanced node design may lead some customers to work with more mature, less risky manufacturing processes that may reduce their need to upgrade or enhance their eda products and design flows;
•   the challenges of developing (or acquiring externally developed) technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in meeting the rapidly evolving requirements of next-generation design challenges;
•   intense competition to attract acquisition targets, possibly making it more difficult for us to acquire companies or technologies at an acceptable price, or at all;
•   new entrants, including larger electronic systems companies, in our business;
•   the combination of our competitors or collaboration among many companies to deliver more comprehensive offerings than they could individually; and
•   decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform engineering services or ip development internally, rather than purchase these services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or excess engineering capacity.
10
we compete most frequently with synopsys, inc. and mentor graphics corporation, which was acquired by siemens ag in 2017, and also with numerous other eda providers, manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed, acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products, electronics design and consulting companies, and other ip companies. these include altium limited, ansys, inc., ceva, inc., keysight technologies, inc. and zuken ltd.
we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions.
we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in order to expand our product offerings. our future revenue growth and expansion of our business is dependent on our successful integration of our acquisitions. we may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions, including acquisitions that are not consummated. potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks. if any of the following acquisition-related risks occur, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted:
•   the failure to realize, or a delay in realizing, anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;
•   overlapping customers and product sets that impact our ability to maintain revenue at historical rates;
•   the failure to understand, compete and operate effectively in markets where we have limited experience;
•   the failure to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively;
•   the failure to integrate and retain key employees of an acquired company or business;
•   difficulties in combining previously separate companies or businesses into a single unit;
•   the substantial diversion of management's attention from day-to-day business when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and integrating an acquired company or business;
•   the discovery, after completion of the acquisition, of unanticipated liabilities assumed from an acquired company, business or assets, such that we cannot realize the anticipated value of the acquisition;
•   difficulties related to integrating the products of an acquired company or business in, for example, distribution, engineering, licensing models or customer support areas;
•   unanticipated costs; or
•   unwillingness of customers of an acquired business to continue licensing or buying products from us following the acquisition.
in a number of our completed acquisitions, we have agreed to make future payments, either in the form of employee retention bonuses or contingent purchase price payments, based on the achievement of specified milestones. the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to the achievement by the acquired company or business, or by the employees who joined us with the acquired company or business, of certain specified bookings, revenue, run rate, product proliferation, product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition. the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition. we may continue to use contingent payments in connection with acquisitions in the future and while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations, we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value.
future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired company or business, grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses (which may be dilutive to existing stockholders), expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt. these arrangements may impact our liquidity, financial position and results of operations or increase dilution of our stockholders' equity interests in the company.
we make and expect to make strategic investments and may not realize the expected benefits of these investments.
we have made and expect to make strategic investments in which we have a minority equity interest and do not have operational control. these strategic investments may also involve collaboration agreements that further and complement our strategy and marketing efforts. we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of these investments, and the related collaborations may be difficult to manage without sole decision-making authority and the economic or business interests in these collaborations may become inconsistent with our interests. these challenges could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
the accounting applied to strategic investments depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our percentage of ownership and the level of our influence over the entity. losses experienced by these strategic investment entities or associated impairment charges could adversely impact our operating results and the value of our investment. in addition, if these entities fail and cease operations, we may lose the value of our investment and shared profits.
failure to obtain export licenses or restrictions on trade imposed by the united states or other countries could harm our business by rendering us unable to sell or ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states.
we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in selling or shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals. changes in these regulations or restrictions due to changes in trade relationships with the united states, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, sanctions, trade embargoes and other trade barriers, could harm our business, operating results or financial condition.
11
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue, expenses, cash flows and financial condition.
we have significant operations outside the united states. our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 57% during fiscal 2018, 58% during fiscal 2017, and 54% during fiscal 2016. we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. we also transact business in various foreign currencies, although the majority of our revenue contracts worldwide are denominated in u.s. dollars. volatility of currencies in countries where we conduct business, most notably the u.s. dollar, chinese renminbi, japanese yen, european union euro, british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results.
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the u.s. dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business, operating results or financial condition. for example, when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the u.s. dollar, it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of u.s. dollars than before the change. if we price our products and services in the foreign currency, we receive fewer u.s. dollars than we did before the change. if we price our products and services in u.s. dollars, the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency. this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency. on the other hand, when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the u.s. dollar, it takes more u.s. dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency. as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations, this results in an increase in operating expenses. approximately 30% of our total costs and expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful, and significant exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in u.s. dollars.
our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of u.s. and foreign tax law changes, outcomes of current or future tax examinations, or by material differences between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates.
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions, with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods. our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following:
•   changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws in the united states, ireland, hungary, the united kingdom, china, the republic of korea, japan, india or other international locations where we have operations;
•   earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are taxed at lower rates as compared to the united states federal and state statutory tax rates;
•   an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;
•   an increase in corporate minimum taxes;
•   changes in tax benefits from stock-based compensation;
•   changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets;
•   changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that results in a recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period;
•   increases to interest or penalty expenses classified in the financial statements as income taxes;
•   new accounting standards or interpretations of such standards; or
•   results of examinations by the internal revenue service ("irs"), state, and foreign tax or other governmental authorities.
the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and other non-income tax returns, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth or franchise, property, goods and services, consumption, import, stamp, and excise taxes, in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions. the calculation of our provision for income taxes and our accruals for other taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations. however, the final outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues, cannot be estimated with certainty. in addition, we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for other taxes. should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes, penalties or interest as a result of a current or a future examination, we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods.
forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss, the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates, as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets, the impact of various accounting rules, our interpretations of changes in tax laws and results of tax audits. forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes. in addition, we account for certain tax benefits from stock-based compensation in the period the stock compensation vests or is settled, which may cause increased variability in our quarterly effective tax rates. if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.
12
tax laws, regulations, and compliance practices are evolving and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was enacted in december 2017, and significantly affected u.s. tax law by changing how the u.s. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. the u.s. department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations. as additional interpretative guidance is issued by the applicable authorities, we may need to revise our provision (benefit) for income taxes in future periods. these revisions could materially affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial position. for further discussion regarding our income taxes, please refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" under the heading "income taxes" and note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic, political, and other conditions. there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues, particularly from multinational corporations, which may lead to an increase in audit activity and harsher positions taken by tax authorities. we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us.
the organisation for economic co-operation and development ("oecd"), an international association of 36 countries, including the united states, released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting ("beps") action plans, which aim to standardize and modernize global tax policies. the beps action plans propose revisions to numerous tax rules, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment, hybrid entities and instruments, transfer pricing, and tax treaties. the beps action plans have been or are being enacted by countries where we have operations. the european commission ("ec") has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries, including ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. the ec and oecd have also been evaluating new rules on the taxation of the digital economy companies. in addition, taiwan, italy, the united kingdom, france, india and hungary have recently introduced new rulings or proposals to tax digital transactions. these developments in tax laws and regulations, and compliance with these rules, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.
our stock price has been subject to fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations.
the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future, and as a result you could lose the value of your investment. the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including:
•   quarterly or annual operating or financial results or forecasts that fail to meet or are inconsistent with earlier projections or the expectations of our securities analysts or investors;
•   changes in our forecasted bookings, revenue, earnings or operating cash flow estimates;
•   an increase in our debt or other liabilities;
•   market conditions in the electronics systems and semiconductor industries;
•   announcements of a restructuring plan;
•   changes in management;
•   repurchases of shares of our common stock or changes to plans to repurchase shares of our common stock;
•   a gain or loss of a significant customer or market segment share;
•   litigation;
•   announcements of a merger, acquisition or other corporate transaction; and
•   announcements of new products or acquisitions of new technologies by us, our competitors or our customers.
in addition, equity markets in general, and the equities of technology companies in particular, have experienced and may experience in the future, extreme price and volume fluctuations due to, among other factors, the actions of market participants or other actions outside of our control. such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.
our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy products and purchase services.
our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license, service and maintenance revenues. in future periods, customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance. our customers, many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies, often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us. customer consolidation can reduce the total level of purchases of our software, hardware, ip and services, and in some cases, increase customers' bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers, including us.
13
we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties.
there are numerous patents relating to our business and ecosystem. new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry, including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringement-related licensing and litigation. it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others. as a result, from time to time, we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer's rights.
intellectual property infringement claims, including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to third-party claims against our customers, regardless of merit, could consume valuable management time, result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays, all of which could seriously harm our business, operating results or financial condition. the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products. in settling these claims, we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement. these royalty or licensing agreements, if available, may not have terms favorable to us. being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business, operating results or financial condition.
any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following:
•   pay damages (including the potential for treble damages), license fees or royalties (including royalties for past periods) to the party claiming infringement;
•   stop licensing products or providing services that use the challenged intellectual property;
•   obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or
•   redesign the challenged technology, which could be time consuming and costly, or impossible.
if we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business or operating results may suffer.
if our security measures are breached, and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data, financial data or assets or our proprietary business information, our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure, and our business and reputation could be harmed.
our products and services involve storage, including cloud-based storage, and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers. we have offices throughout the world, including key research and development facilities outside of the united states. our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks by unauthorized third parties (which may include nation-states and individuals sponsored by them) or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, which could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations. third parties may attempt to gain unauthorized access through a variety of methods (such as the use of viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing, denial of service attacks and other cyber attacks) and corrupt the processes of the products and services that we provide. we may also be a target of malicious attacks in an attempt to gain access to our network, including our cadence cloud portfolio which includes both our managed and customer-managed environments, or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, services or infrastructure; steal financial data or assets or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, loss of financial assets, litigation and potential liability. because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, if we select a vendor that uses cloud storage of information as part of their service or product offerings or are selected as a vendor for our cadence cloud portfolio, despite our attempts to validate the security of such services, our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties. in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security of one of our vendors, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, legal or regulatory actions could be initiated against us and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers, or suffer harm to our financial condition.
risks associated with our international operations could adversely impact our financial condition.
a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations, and we have offices throughout the world, including key research and development facilities outside of the united states. our international operations may be subject to a number of risks, including:
•   shifts in political, trade or other policies or other governmental dynamics resulting from the results of certain elections or votes, such as changes in policies pursued by the united states, china or the republic of korea, or changes associated with and the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union;
•   the adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions, including tariffs, export or import regulations, sanctions or other trade barriers;
•   limitations on repatriation of earnings;
•   limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies;
•   reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;
•   performance of national economies;
14
•   longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;
•   difficulties in managing foreign operations;
•   political and economic instability;
•   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
•   inability to continue to offer competitive compensation in certain growing regions;
•   differing employment practices and labor issues;
•   united states' and other governments' licensing requirements for exports, which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products; and
•   variations in costs or expenses associated with our international operations, including as a result of changes in foreign tax laws or devaluation of the u.s. dollar relative to other foreign currencies.
some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there may be a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability, terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically. furthermore, this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad. we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war. furthermore, our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world. activities that interfere with our international connectivity or operations, such as cyber hacking, the introduction of a virus into our computer systems, natural disasters, civil unrest or terrorism, could significantly interfere with our business operations.
in addition, internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations.
we depend upon our management team and key employees, and our failure to attract, train, motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations.
our business depends upon the continued services, efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees. competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense, particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area, where our principal offices are located, and in other locations where we maintain facilities. in addition, competition for qualified personnel, including software engineers, in the eda, commercial electronics engineering services and ip industries has intensified. further, increased uncertainty regarding social, political and immigration policies in the united states and abroad may make it difficult to recruit employees with adequate experience. we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. from time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers, and as a result, we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees, customers and suppliers may be adversely affected.
to attract, retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise, we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense, and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which could harm our operating results. the high cost of training new employees, not fully utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results.
in addition, applicable rules and regulations require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans (including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans). these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future. to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, which could materially and adversely affect our business.
we rely on our proprietary technology, as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties, and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties.
our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. we generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products. despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property, third parties have tried in the past, and may try in the future, to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these safeguards. our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages. patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states. the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights, or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights.
15
many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future. our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties, including that of our competitors. our failure to obtain software, other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms, or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights, could seriously harm our business, operating results or financial condition.
we have substantial cash requirements in the united states, but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states, and if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states, then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.
we have significant operations outside the united states. as of december 29, 2018, approximately 75% of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states, with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states. we believe that the combination of our u.s. cash, cash equivalents, future u.s. operating cash flows, cash available under our revolving credit facility and other cash that may be accessible to us on attractive terms are sufficient to meet our ongoing u.s. operating expenses and debt repayment obligations. although the tax act may have reduced the tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings, there are still administrative processes associated with repatriation of foreign earnings that could affect the timing of returning cash to the u.s. from non-u.s. jurisdictions. accordingly, if our u.s. cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states, we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and the market price of our common stock.
litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations.
we currently are, and in the future may be, involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, including customer indemnification, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contracts, distribution arrangements and employee relations matters. for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged, please refer to the discussion under part i, item 3, "legal proceedings" and note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management's time and attention from our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.
errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business.
our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity, each of which has its own specifications. because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work, some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace. as a result, our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design, or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected. errors or defects could result in:
•   loss of customers;
•   loss of market share;
•   damage to our reputation;
•   failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;
•   diversion of development resources to resolve the problem;
•   loss of or delay in revenue or payments;
•   increased service costs; and
•   liability for damages.
our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays, customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses.
occasionally, our customers file for bankruptcy or face other challenging financial or operating conditions. if our customers experience adversity in their business, they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us, request to modify contract terms, or modify or cancel plans to license our products. for instance, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are generally not cancelable. our customers' inability to fulfill payment obligations, in turn, may adversely affect our revenue, operating expenses and cash flow. additionally, our customers have, in the past, sought, and may, in the future, seek, to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
16
the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly.
generally, we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer. the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education, evaluation and approval process. consequently, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities.
in addition, sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of:
•   the timing of customers' competitive evaluation processes; or
•   customers' budgetary constraints and budget cycles.
long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles, and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes.
united states generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"), the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. we are also subject to evolving rules and regulations of the countries in which we do business. changes to accounting standards or interpretations thereof may result in different accounting principles under u.s. gaap that could have a significant effect on our reported financial results.
in addition, we have in the past and may in the future need to significantly change our customer contracts, accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles. the cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition.
our restructuring plans incur substantial costs and may not result in the benefits we have anticipated, possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results.
in recent fiscal years, we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to reallocate or decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities. we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans, and our restructuring activities may subject us to reputational risks and litigation risks and expenses. our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that we will realize anticipated cost savings and other benefits or that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future. in addition, our restructuring plans may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us. as a result, our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future.
we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products, making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation.
we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products. our reliance on sole suppliers and contract manufacturers could result in product delivery problems and delays and reduced control over product pricing and quality. though we prefer to have multiple sources to procure certain key components, in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so. we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason. any supply or manufacturing disruption, including delay in delivery of components by our suppliers or products by our manufacturers, or the bankruptcy or shutdown of our suppliers or manufacturers, could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers, which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results.
if we become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could be prevented from hiring needed employees, incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves.
when companies in our industry lose employees to competitors, they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages. we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims, regardless of their merits. defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations.
17
anti-takeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock.
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company. for example:
•   our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue, at any time and without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as it may determine. no shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. however, the rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock.
•   section 203 of the delaware general corporation law generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with a person owning 15% or more of its voting stock, or who is affiliated with the corporation and owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any time within three years prior to the proposed business combination, for a period of three years from the date the person became a 15% owner, unless specified conditions are met.
all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist, delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders.
the investment of our cash is subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.
our marketable investments include various money market funds and may include other investments as well. weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit, liquidity, market prices and interest rates for these and other types of investments. additionally, changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee or other relevant regulators and concerns about the rising u.s. government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the u.s. dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio. the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.
we are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance.
we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, nasdaq, and the fasb, as well as evolving investor expectations around corporate governance, executive compensation and environmental and social practices and disclosures. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the u.s. and foreign governments, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. the increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations, rules and regulations, as well as any risk of noncompliance, could adversely impact us.
conflict minerals regulations may cause us to continue to incur additional expenses and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.
in august 2012, the sec adopted new rules establishing disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of certain minerals referred to as "conflict minerals" in products. these rules require us to determine, disclose and report whether or not such minerals in our products originate from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries. we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with these rules, including costs associated with conducting due diligence on our supply chain and fulfilling our reporting requirements, and we may incur costs related to changes to our products, processes or sources of supply. in addition, these rules could affect the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our emulation and prototyping hardware products and ip boards (the "covered products"), and thus impact our ability to source, at competitive prices, certain materials that are used in the covered products. finally, our customers may prefer to purchase products from vendors who claim that all minerals in their products are conflict-free, and our revenues may be harmed or we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify that our covered products are conflict-free.
our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters.
our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities, is located in the silicon valley area of northern california, a region known to experience seismic activity. if significant seismic activity were to occur, our operations may be interrupted, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
our other offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may be adversely impacted by natural disasters. if a natural disaster occurs at or near any of our offices, our operations may be interrupted, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. if a natural disaster impacts a significant number of our customers, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
18
risks related to our securities and indebtedness our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness.
as of december 29, 2018, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $445.3 million. we also had the ability to borrow an additional $250.0 million under our revolving credit facility, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $250.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $600.0 million under our revolving credit facility. subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility, the indenture that governs the 4.375% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 notes") and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, share repurchases or for other purposes. if we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:
•   making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to service our debt as described above;
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;
•   requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
•   utilizing large portions of our u.s. cash to service our debt obligations because those payments are made in the united states, which may require us to repatriate cash from outside the united states;
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, are at variable rates of interest;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;
•   placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources;
•   limiting our interest deductions for us income tax purposes; and
•   increasing our cost of borrowing.
at the option of the holders of our outstanding notes, we may, under certain circumstances, be required to repurchase such notes.
under the terms of our 2024 notes, we may be required to repurchase for cash such notes prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain significant corporate events. specifically, we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a "change of control triggering event" (as defined in the indenture related to such notes), such as a change of control accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of such notes. the repayment obligations under such notes may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company. if we were required to pay the 2024 notes prior to their scheduled maturity, it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives.
the terms of the agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2024 notes restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.
the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:
•   pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;
•   prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;
•   issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;
•   make certain investments;
•   incur liens;
•   incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;
•   enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
•   enter into transactions with affiliates;
•   alter the businesses we conduct;
•   enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends; and
•   consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.
in addition, the restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our revolving credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them.
19
a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. in addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. as a result of these restrictions, we may be:
•   limited in how we conduct our business;
•   unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or
•   unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.
the indenture governing our 2024 notes also contains certain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions.
these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. in addition, our financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.
our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. the agreement governing our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.
in addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, none of which are currently guarantors of our indebtedness. accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. unless they become guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. while the agreement governing our revolving credit facility limits the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.
our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.
if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. in addition, a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us, potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration.
despite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt. this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.
we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. although the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the 2024 notes, then subject to any collateral arrangements we may enter into, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company.
20
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. if interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. assuming all loans were fully drawn, we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $1.5 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. in the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. however, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.
various factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital, including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our 2024 notes by credit rating agencies.
we may in the future seek additional financing for a variety of reasons, and our future borrowing costs and access to capital could be affected by factors including the condition of the debt and equity markets, the condition of the economy generally, prevailing interest rates, our level of indebtedness and our business and financial condition. in addition, the 2024 notes currently have an investment grade credit rating, and any credit rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in that credit rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the credit rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 notes. any future lowering of the credit ratings of the 2024 notes likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and with part i, item 1a, "risk factors." please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10-k regarding forward-looking statements.
business overview we enable our customers to design electronic products. our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of electronic systems, ics, electronic devices and increasingly sophisticated manufactured products. our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers' products to market and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. we offer software, hardware, services and reusable ic design blocks, which are commonly referred to as ip.
our strategy, which we call sde, is to provide the technologies necessary for our customers to develop a complete and functional electronic product. our sde strategy enables us to address the growing trends of electronic systems companies developing their own ics as part of their end product systems, as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of the systems into which their ic products are integrated. our products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products, so demand for our products is driven by our customers' investment in new designs and products. historically, the industry that provided the tools used by ic engineers was referred to as eda. today, our offerings include and extend beyond eda tools to include sde.
we combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities:
•   functional verification, including emulation and prototyping hardware;
•   digital ic design and signoff;
•   custom ic design and simulation;
•   system interconnect and analysis; and
•   ip.
for additional information about our products, see the discussion in item 1, "business," under the heading "products and product strategy."
we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings "results of operations" and "liquidity and capital resources."
results of operations financial results for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017 and 2016, reflect the following:
•   the effects of adopting asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)," which provided a new basis of accounting for our revenue arrangements during fiscal 2018;
•   increased product and maintenance revenue resulting from overall growth in our software, hardware and ip business, particularly in the united states and asia; and
•   continued investment in research and development activities focused on creating and enhancing our products.
the adoption of topic 606 limits the comparability of revenue and certain expenses, including sales commissions, presented in the results of operations for fiscal 2018, when compared to the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. for additional information regarding the adoption of this and other accounting standards at the beginning of fiscal 2018, see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "recently adopted accounting standards."
our fiscal years are 52- or 53-week periods ending on the saturday closest to december 31. fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were each 52-week fiscal years.
revenue we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip, selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and ip, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip. the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and ip products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery.
approximately 90% of our revenue is recognized over time, and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized at the point in time that control is transferred to the customer. revenue recognized over time includes revenue from our software arrangements, services, royalties from certain ip arrangements, maintenance on ip licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware. revenue recognized at a point in time is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and ip licenses. our ability to maintain this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers.
24
during fiscal 2018, we recognized revenue based on asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)," whereas during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we recognized revenue based on "revenue recognition (topic 605)." therefore, the periods are not directly comparable. for additional information on the impact of the new accounting standard on our revenue, see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "recently adopted accounting standards."

product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily because of increased investments by our customers in new, complex designs for their products resulting in revenue growth in each of our five product categories. product and maintenance revenue may fluctuate from period to period and by geography based on demand for our hardware and ip offerings. product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily because of growth in our software and ip businesses, partially offset by lower revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware.
services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and ip performance obligations.
no one customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.

cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period. cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, reserves for inventory, as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties' intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology.
the changes in product and maintenance-related costs were due to the following:

(in millions)
emulation and prototyping hardware costs         $17.7              $(22.9        )

$18.9              $(26.0        )
costs of emulation and prototyping increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to increased sales volume for emulation and prototyping hardware and related costs. costs of emulation and prototyping hardware decreased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to decreased sales volume for emulation and prototyping hardware. gross margins on our hardware products will fluctuate based on product life cycle, product competition, product mix and pricing strategies.
cost of services cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects or on internal development projects. cost of services increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to variation in the number of personnel dedicated to deliver and support our services and custom ip offerings.
operating expenses our operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, restructuring activities, foreign exchange rate movements, stock-based compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results.
stock-based compensation included in our operating expenses increased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily because successive increases in the price of our common stock between grant dates have resulted in higher grant date fair values for the mix of stock awards expensed in each period. we expect stock-based compensation to increase operating expenses during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018. for further discussion regarding stock-based compensation, see note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies. for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency risk."

general and administrative costs decreased during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to decreases in expense related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan that are included in salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, partially offset by increases in reserves on receivables from our customers. general and administrative costs increased during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to an increase in accounting and tax services and an increase in employee salaries and benefits.

restructuring and other charges we have initiated restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy. because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management's estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future.
the following table presents restructuring and other charges, net for our restructuring plans:

income taxes the following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016:
2018                                                            2017                    2016
(in millions, except percentages)

effective tax rate                 8.1     %              35.2     %              14.4     %
our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 primarily resulted from the federal income tax effects of the tax act and state and foreign income taxes on fiscal 2018 income, partially offset by $21.3 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the year.
30
during fiscal 2018, we finalized our fiscal 2017 deemed repatriation transition tax calculation and reduced our estimate from $67.2 million to $65.8 million. we finalized our other fiscal 2017 provisional estimates without change. for further discussion regarding our accounting for the tax act, see note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 is primarily attributable to income tax effects of the tax act. the provisional amount related to the transition tax was $67.2 million and the provisional amount related to the re-measurement of our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities for the u.s. tax rate reduction was $25.2 million. our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 included $32.0 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or settled during the period.
our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2016 is primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2016 income and includes the tax benefit resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the united states research tax credit in december 2015. during fiscal 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for stock-based compensation that required all income tax effects of stock-based awards to be recognized in our consolidated income statement as the awards vest or are settled. our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2016 includes $17.2 million of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation that vested or settled during the period.
our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. we currently expect that our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will be approximately 10%. we expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate. we may also revise our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate as a result of further analyzing the implications of the tax act, including future guidance issued by the u.s. department of treasury and the irs. for additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see part i, item 1a, "risk factors." for further discussion regarding our income taxes, see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources as of                                                                      change december 29,            december 30,            december 31, 2016          2018 vs. 2017                2017 vs. 2016

cash and cash equivalents as of december 29, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $533.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $688.1 million as of december 30, 2017.
our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2018 were cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.
our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2018 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, principal payments on the 2019 term loan, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of non-marketable investments, payments on our revolving credit facility, tax payments and purchases of property, plant and equipment.
approximately 75% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 29, 2018. we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months.
net working capital net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. the decrease in our net working capital as of december 29, 2018, as compared to december 30, 2017, is primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and increases in current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable.

cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to the improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.
cash flows from investing activities cash flows provided by (used for) investing activities during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

the decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily because we did not acquire any businesses in fiscal 2018, offset by payments to acquire equity instruments of other entities. the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for business combinations and a decrease in net proceeds from our investment portfolio. we expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making strategic investments.
cash flows from financing activities cash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily due to the prepayment of the outstanding principal balance on our $300.0 million 2019 term loan, an increase in repurchases of common stock and a decrease in net proceeds on our revolving credit facility. the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to a decrease in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock, partially offset by a net decrease in proceeds from borrowings.
other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources stock repurchase program in january 2017, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a value of up to $525.0 million in the aggregate. as of december 29, 2018, approximately $175.0 million remained available under this authorization. in february 2019, our board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of shares of our common stock with a value of up to $500.0 million in the aggregate. the actual timing and amount of future repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. see part ii, item 5, "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" for additional information.

revolving credit facility our senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $350.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $250.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $600.0 million. the credit facility expires on january 28, 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors. any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on january 28, 2022. outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity. as of december 29, 2018, there were $100.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the revolving credit facility.
2024 notes in october 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due october 15, 2024. we received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. interest is payable in cash semi-annually. the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. as of december 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 notes.

(1)   with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us, this table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of december 29, 2018 or the earliest cancellation date.
(2)   included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $18.7 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. of the $18.7 million, we estimate $17.5 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years and $1.2 million within 3 to 5 years. the remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 29, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. at least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.
we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. for information on our significant accounting policies, see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
33
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. the tax act has many provisions that require additional guidance on specific interpretations of the tax law changes. our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.
we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. to make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software and/or ip licenses, hardware and services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. in some arrangements, such as most of our ip license arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. in other arrangements, like our time-based software arrangements, the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other. our time-based software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products, as well as technical support, and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single, combined performance obligation.
judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices ("ssps") for each distinct performance obligation. we rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis, so we are required to estimate the ssp for each performance obligation. in instances where the ssp is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the ssp.
revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses, updates, and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations. for our professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. a number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. for our other performance obligations recognized over time, revenue is generally recognized using a time-based measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term.
if a group of agreements are so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.
we are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. in some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. these estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.

business combinations when we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. these estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.
we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.
new accounting standards leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)," requiring, among other things, the recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet by lessees for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. a modified retrospective approach is required, applying the new standard to leases existing as of the date of initial application. an entity may choose to apply the standard as of either its effective date or the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. we adopted the new standard on december 30, 2018, the first day of fiscal 2019, and used the effective date as our date of initial application. consequently, financial information will not be updated, and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. we elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to carry forward our prior conclusions about lease identification and classification.
we estimate the key change upon adoption of the standard will result in balance sheet recognition of additional lease assets and lease liabilities ranging from $75 to $85 million as of december 30, 2018, which is based on the present value of committed lease payments. we do not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of lease expenses within our consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income or consolidated statements of cash flows.
the new standard also provides updated guidance for lessor accounting; however, we do not expect the new standard to have a material effect on our financial statements for arrangements in which we are the lessor.
credit losses in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, "measurement of credit losses on financial instruments," which supersedes current guidance requiring recognition of credit losses when it is probable that a loss has been incurred. the new standard requires the establishment of an allowance for estimated credit losses on financial assets, including trade and other receivables, at each reporting date. the new standard will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses on trade and other receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash. the new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. we are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures.
goodwill impairment in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04, "simplifying the test for goodwill impairment," that eliminates "step 2" from the goodwill impairment test. the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. the new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.

income tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income in february 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-02, "reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income," which allows a reclassification of the income tax effects of the tax act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. the new guidance may be applied at the beginning of the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in federal income tax rate from the tax act is recognized. the new standard became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will impact our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures.
stock-based compensation in june 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-07, "improvements to nonemployee share-based payment accounting," to simplify the accounting for share-based transactions with nonemployees in which the grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed. under the new standard, most of the guidance on recording share-based compensation granted to nonemployees will be aligned with the requirements for share-based compensation granted to employees. this standard became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
fair value measurements in august 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-13, "disclosure framework - changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement," which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. while we continue to assess the potential impact of this standard, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
internal-use software in august 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-15, "customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract," which clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements. the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and early adoption is permitted. we are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

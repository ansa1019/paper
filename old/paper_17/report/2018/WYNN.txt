item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, regarding matters that could have an adverse effect, including a material one, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
risks related to our business the controversy, regulatory action, litigation and investigations related to stephen a. wynn and his separation from the company could significantly harm our business.
on february 6, 2018, mr. wynn resigned as ceo and chairman of the board of directors after allegations of inappropriate personal conduct by mr. wynn in the workplace were reported in a january 26, 2018 wall street journal article. the resulting controversy related to mr. wynn and his separation from the company could significantly harm our business in numerous ways, including in ways that we cannot predict. as discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, our gaming regulators in massachusetts and nevada have investigated the situation. our nevada gaming regulators have completed their investigation and, on february 26, 2019, fined the company $20.0 million. each of our regulatory authorities has extensive power to license and oversee the operations of our casino resorts and could take action against the company and its related licensees, including actions that could affect the ability or terms upon which our subsidiaries hold their gaming licenses and concessions, and the suitability of the company to continue as a stockholder of those subsidiaries. as discussed in item 3-"legal proceedings" and item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 15, "commitments and contingencies," lawsuits have been filed against the company and our board of directors arising out of the allegations against mr. wynn, and such claims present a number of risks, including distraction of management, assertions that could affect our reputation, and potential legal liabilities. additional allegations have been and may in the future be asserted against the company, and additional regulatory or legal proceedings involving the company may be commenced in the future. in addition, the company's integrated resort business model was pioneered by mr. wynn. our business, reputation, and competitive position may now suffer as a result of our prior association with mr. wynn, or as a result of his separation from the company and the loss of his skills and experience.
we are subject to extensive state and local regulation, and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations. the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations and authorities could have a negative effect on our business.
the operations of our resorts are contingent upon our obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, permits, approvals, registrations, findings of suitability, orders and authorizations in the jurisdictions in which our resorts are located. the laws, regulations and ordinances requiring these licenses, permits and other approvals generally relate to the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations, as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. the ngc may require the holder of any debt or securities that we or wynn las vegas, llc issue to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own wynn resorts' securities if it has reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the state of nevada.
the company's articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent required by the gaming authority making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent the board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, that a person is likely to jeopardize the company's or any affiliate's application for, receipt of, approval for, right to the use of, or entitlement to, any gaming license, shares of wynn resorts' capital stock that are owned or controlled by such unsuitable person or its affiliates are subject to redemption by wynn resorts. the redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as wynn resorts elects.
nevada and massachusetts regulatory authorities have broad powers to request detailed financial and other information, to limit, condition, suspend or revoke a registration, gaming license or related approvals; approve changes in our operations; and levy fines or require forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming laws or regulations. complying with gaming laws, regulations and license requirements is costly. any change in the nevada and massachusetts laws, regulations or licenses applicable to our business or a violation of any current or future laws or regulations applicable to our business or gaming licenses could require us to make substantial expenditures and forfeit assets, and would negatively affect our gaming operations.
16
our macau operations are subject to unique risks. failure to adhere to the regulatory and gaming environment in macau could result in the revocation of our macau operations' concession or otherwise negatively affect its operations in macau. moreover, we are subject to the risk that u.s. regulators could determine that macau's gaming regulatory framework has not developed in a way that would permit us to conduct operations in macau in a manner consistent with the way in which we intend, or the applicable u.s. gaming authorities require us, to conduct our operations in the united states.
as discussed in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 15, "commitments and contingencies," in connection with the allegations of inappropriate personal conduct by mr. wynn in the workplace reported in a january 26, 2018 wall street journal article, gaming regulators in massachusetts and nevada conducted investigations. our nevada gaming regulators have completed their investigation and, on february 26, 2019, fined the company $20.0 million. each of these regulatory authorities has extensive power to license and oversee the operations of our casino resorts and has taken action and could take action against the company and its related licensees, including actions that could affect the ability or terms upon which our subsidiaries hold their gaming licenses and concessions, and the suitability of the company to continue as a stockholder of those affiliates.
ongoing investigations, litigation and other disputes could distract management and result in negative publicity and additional scrutiny from regulators.
on january 26, 2018, the company's board of directors formed a special committee comprised solely of independent directors to investigate allegations of inappropriate personal conduct by mr. wynn in the workplace. on february 12, 2018, the special committee amended and restated its charter to provide for a review of various governance issues regarding knowledge of the allegations and a comprehensive review of the company's internal policies and procedures with the goal of employing best practices to maintain a safe and respectful workplace for all employees. on august 3, 2018, the board received the final oral presentation from the special committee. the special committee provided a written memorialization to the company's gaming regulators in massachusetts and nevada to cooperate with their respective investigations. our nevada gaming regulators have completed their investigation and, on february 26, 2019, fined the company $20.0 million.
as discussed in item 3-"legal proceedings" and item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 15, "commitments and contingencies," lawsuits have been filed against the company and our board of directors arising out of the allegations against mr. wynn, and such claims present a number of risks, including distraction of management, assertions that could affect our reputation, and potential legal liabilities. additional allegations have been and may in the future be asserted against mr. wynn and/or the company, and additional regulatory or legal proceedings involving the company may be commenced in the future.
the foregoing investigations, litigation and other disputes and any additional such matters that may arise in the future, can be expensive and may divert management's attention from the operations of our businesses. the investigations, litigation and other disputes may also lead to additional scrutiny from regulators, which could lead to investigations relating to, and possibly a negative impact on, the company's gaming licenses and the company's ability to bid successfully for new gaming market opportunities. in addition, the actions, litigation and publicity could negatively impact our business, reputation and competitive position and could reduce demand for shares of wynn resorts and wml and thereby have a negative impact on the trading prices of their respective shares.
we depend on the continued services of key managers and employees. if we do not retain our key personnel or attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business will suffer.
our ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the services of our senior management team. the loss of services of our senior managers or the inability to attract and retain additional senior management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer and corporate spending as a result of global economic conditions.
consumer demand for casino/hotel resorts, trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities that we offer is particularly sensitive to changes in the global economy, which adversely impact discretionary spending on leisure activities. changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general global economic conditions, high unemployment, weakness in housing or oil markets, perceived or actual changes in disposable
17
consumer income and wealth, an economic recession and changes in consumer confidence in the global economy, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism have in the past and could in the future reduce customer demand for the luxury amenities and leisure activities we offer, and may have a significant negative impact on our operating results.
also, consumer demographics and preferences may evolve over time, which, for example, has resulted in growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and react to those trends and any failure to do so may negatively impact our operating results.
demand for our products and services in macau and las vegas may be negatively impacted by international relations, economic disruptions in mainland china, visa restrictions placed on citizens of mainland china, the anti-corruption campaign, restrictions on international money transfers or similar campaigns.
a significant amount of our gaming revenues in macau and las vegas come from customers from mainland china. economic disruption, international relations, contraction and uncertainty in china could impact the number of patrons visiting our macau and las vegas properties or the amount they spend. in addition, policies adopted from time to time by governments, including any travel restrictions imposed on chinese citizens such as restrictions imposed on exit visas or restrictions on united states visitor visas, could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to our properties. it is not known when, or if, policies restricting visitation by mainland chinese citizens will be put in place and such policies may be adjusted, without notice, in the future. furthermore, the chinese government's continuing anti-corruption campaign has influenced the behavior of chinese consumers and their spending patterns both domestically and abroad. that campaign, as well as mainland chinese and macau monetary outflow policies have specifically led to tighter monetary transfer regulations, real-time monitoring of certain financial channels, limitations on cash withdrawals from atm machines by mainland china citizens, reduction of annual withdrawal limits from bank accounts while the account holder is outside of mainland china, and "know your client" protocols implemented on atm machines. these policies may affect and impact the number of visitors and the amount of money they spend. the overall effect of the campaign and monetary transfer restrictions may negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.
our business is particularly sensitive to the willingness of our customers to travel to and spend time at our resorts. acts or the threat of acts of terrorism, regional political events and developments in certain countries could cause severe disruptions in air and other travel and may otherwise negatively impact tourists' willingness to visit our resorts. such events or developments could reduce the number of visitors to our facilities, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel. only a small amount of our business is and will be generated by local residents. most of our customers travel to reach our las vegas and macau properties. acts of terrorism or concerns over the possibility of such acts may severely disrupt domestic and international travel, which would result in a decrease in customer visits to las vegas and macau, including our properties. regional conflicts could have a similar effect on domestic and international travel. disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any terrorist act, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war or worldwide infectious disease outbreak would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
furthermore, the attack in las vegas on october 1, 2017 underscores the possibility that large public facilities could become the target of mass shootings or other attacks in the future. the occurrence or the possibility of attacks could cause all or portions of affected properties to be shut down for prolonged periods, resulting in a loss of income; generally reduce travel to affected areas for tourism and business or adversely affect the willingness of customers to stay in or avail themselves of the services of the affected properties; expose us to a risk of monetary claims arising from death, injury or damage to property caused by any such attack; and result in higher costs for security and insurance premiums, all of which could adversely affect our results.
our continued success depends on our ability to maintain the reputation of our resorts.
our strategy and integrated resort business model rely on positive perceptions of our resorts and the level of service we provide. any deterioration in our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. our reputation could be negatively impacted by our failure to deliver the superior design and customer service for which we are known or by events that are beyond our control. our reputation may also suffer as a result of negative publicity regarding the company or our resorts, including as a result of social media reports, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity. the continued expansion of media and social media formats has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity and has made it more difficult to control and effectively manage negative publicity.
18
we are entirely dependent on a limited number of resorts for all of our cash flow, which subjects us to greater risks than a gaming company with more operating properties.
we are currently entirely dependent upon our macau operations and las vegas operations for all of our operating cash flow. as a result, we are subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company with more operating properties or greater geographic diversification. the risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following:
•   changes in local economic and competitive conditions;
•   changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations, and the way in which those laws and regulations are applied;
•   natural and other disasters, including the outbreak of infectious diseases;
•   an increase in the cost of maintaining our properties;
•   a decline in the number of visitors to las vegas or macau; and
•   a decrease in gaming and non-casino activities at our resorts.
any of the factors outlined above could negatively affect our results of operations and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments or maintain our covenants with respect to our debt.
we are a parent company and our primary source of cash is and will be distributions from our subsidiaries.
we are a parent company with limited business operations of our own. our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries. we conduct most of our business operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries. accordingly, our primary sources of cash are dividends and distributions with respect to our ownership interests in our subsidiaries that are derived from the earnings and cash flow generated by our operating properties. our subsidiaries might not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to pay dividends or distributions in the future.
our subsidiaries' payments to us will be contingent upon their earnings and upon other business considerations. in addition, our subsidiaries' debt instruments and other agreements limit or prohibit certain payments of dividends or other distributions to us. we expect that future debt instruments for the financing of our other developments will contain similar restrictions. an inability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and distributions would have a significant negative effect on our liquidity.
our casino, hotel, convention and other facilities face intense competition, which may increase in the future.
the casino/hotel industry is highly competitive. we hold a concession under one of only three gaming concessions and three subconcessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau. the macau government has had the ability to grant additional gaming concessions since april 2009. if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. several of the current concessionaires and subconcessionaires have opened facilities in the cotai area over the past few years, which has significantly increased gaming and non-gaming offerings in macau, with continued development and further openings in cotai expected in the near future.
our macau operations face competition from casinos located in singapore, the philippines and malaysia. we also encounter competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including australia and las vegas, cruise ships in asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout asia. further, if current efforts to legalize gaming in other asian countries, such as japan, are successful, we will face additional regional competition.
our las vegas operations compete with other las vegas strip hotels and with other hotel casinos in las vegas on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, theme and size, among other factors. wynn las vegas also competes with other casino/hotel facilities in other cities. the proliferation of gaming activities in other areas could significantly harm our business as well. in particular, the legalization or expansion of casino gaming in or near metropolitan areas from which we attract customers could have a negative effect on our business. in addition, new or renovated casinos in macau or elsewhere in asia could draw asian gaming customers away from wynn las vegas.
increased competition could result in a loss of customers, which may negatively affect our cash flows and results of operations.
19
our business relies on premium, international customers. we often extend credit, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit players or credit play may decrease.
general. a significant portion of our table games revenue at our resorts is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium international customers. the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. a downturn in economic conditions in the countries in which these customers reside could cause a reduction in the frequency of visits by and revenue generated from these customers.
we conduct our gaming activities on a credit as well as a cash basis. the casino credit we extend is generally unsecured and due on demand. we will extend casino credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources, in the opinion of management, warrant such an extension. the collectability of receivables from international customers could be negatively affected by future business or economic trends or by significant events in the countries in which these customers reside.
macau operations. although the law in macau permits casino operators to extend credit to gaming customers, our macau operations may not be able to collect all of its gaming receivables from its credit players. we expect that our macau operations will be able to enforce these obligations only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including macau. to the extent our gaming customers are visitors from other jurisdictions, we may not have access to a forum in which we will be able to collect all of our gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and we may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.
currently, the gaming tax in macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue, including the face value of credit instruments issued. as a result, if we extend credit to our customers in macau and are unable to collect on the related receivables from them, we remain obligated to pay taxes on the full amount of the credit instrument.
las vegas operations. while gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a "marker," are enforceable under the current laws of nevada, and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states of the united states under the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that direct or indirect enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the united states of foreign debtors may be used to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from u.s. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations. we cannot assure that we will be able to collect the full amount of gaming debts owed to us, even in jurisdictions that enforce them. changes in economic conditions may make it more difficult to assess creditworthiness and more difficult to collect the full amount of any gaming debt owed to us. our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.
win rates for our gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control.
the gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. in addition to the element of chance, win rates are also affected by other factors, including players' skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the spread of table limits, the volume of bets played, the amount of time played and undiscovered acts of fraud or cheating. our gross gaming revenues are mainly derived from the difference between our casino winnings and the casino winnings of our gaming customers. since there is an inherent element of chance in the gaming industry, we do not have full control over our winnings or the winnings of our gaming customers.
acts of fraud or cheating through the use of counterfeit chips, covert schemes and other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees, may be attempted or committed by our gaming customers with the aim of increasing their winnings. our gaming customers, visitors and employees may also commit crimes such as theft in order to obtain chips not belonging to them. we have taken measures to safeguard our interests including the implementation of systems, processes and technologies to mitigate against these risks, extensive employee training, surveillance, security and investigation operations and adoption of appropriate security features on our chips such as embedded radio frequency identification tags. despite our efforts, we may not be successful in preventing or detecting such culpable behavior and schemes in a timely manner and the relevant insurance we have obtained may not be sufficient to cover our losses depending on the incident, which could result in losses to our gaming operations and generate negative publicity, both of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, premium gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.
20
our new projects may not be successful.
in addition to the construction and regulatory risks associated with our current and future construction projects, we cannot assure you that the level of consumer demand for our casino resorts or for the type of luxury amenities that we will offer will meet our expectations. the operating results of our new projects may be materially different than the operating results of our current integrated resorts due to, among other reasons, differences in consumer and corporate spending and preferences in new geographic areas, increased competition from other markets or other developments that may be beyond our control. in addition, our new projects may be more sensitive to certain risks, including risks associated with downturns in the economy, than the resorts we currently operate. the demands imposed by new developments on our managerial, operational and other resources may impact our operation of our existing resorts. if any of these issues were to occur, it could adversely affect our prospects, financial condition, or results of operations.
we could encounter higher than expected cost increases in the development of our projects.
we are currently constructing encore boston harbor in everett, massachusetts. the total project budget for encore boston harbor, including gaming license fees, construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses and land costs, is estimated to be approximately $2.6 billion. additionally, the company is currently constructing approximately 430,000 square feet of additional meeting and convention space at wynn las vegas and has begun design and site preparation for the reconfiguration of the wynn las vegas golf course, which the company closed in the fourth quarter of 2017. based on current designs, we estimate the total project budget for the additional meeting and convention space and reconfiguration of the golf course to be approximately $425 million. we also have other capital expenditure projects, including in macau, as discussed in item 1-"business - construction and development opportunities" for additional details.
the projected development costs for our projects reflect our best estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected. contingencies that have been set aside by us to cover potential cost overruns or potential delays may be insufficient to cover the full amount of such overruns or delays. if these contingencies are not sufficient to cover these costs, or if we are not able to recover damages for these delays and contingencies, we may not have the funds required to pay the excess costs and this project may not be completed. failure to complete this project may negatively affect our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to pay our debt.
construction projects will be subject to development and construction risks, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
major construction projects of the scope and scale of encore boston harbor and the redevelopment of the wynn las vegas golf course land entail significant risks, including:
•   unanticipated cost increases;
•   shortages of, and price increases in, materials or skilled labor;
•   changes to plans and specifications;
•   delays in obtaining or inability to obtain requisite licenses, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities;
•   changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, real estate development or construction projects;
•   unforeseen engineering, environmental and/or geological problems;
•   labor disputes or work stoppages;
•   disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;
•   personal injuries to workers and other persons;
•   environment, health and safety issues, including site accidents;
•   delays or interference from severe weather or natural disasters;
•   geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and
•   unavailability of construction equipment.
construction, equipment or staffing problems or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities could increase the total cost, delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of our projects.
21
we anticipate that only some of the subcontractors engaged for these projects will post bonds guaranteeing timely completion of the subcontractor's work and payment for all of that subcontractor's labor and materials. these bonds may not be adequate to ensure completion of the work.
our facilities currently under development may not commence operations on schedule and construction costs for the projects may exceed budgeted amounts. failure to complete the projects on schedule or within budget may have a significant negative effect on us and on our ability to make payments on our debt.
we are currently required to commence gaming operations at encore boston harbor by june 2020. if we are unable to meet this deadline, the massachusetts gaming commission may suspend or revoke our gaming license.
pursuant to the gaming act, the company is required to commence gaming operations at encore boston harbor approximately one year from our projected opening date of mid-2019. if the company is unable to meet the june 2020 deadline and is unable to obtain an extension of the deadline from the mgc, the mgc may suspend or revoke our gaming license and, if we are found by the mgc after a hearing to have acted in bad faith, we will be assessed a fine of up to $50,000,000. failure to meet the deadline could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from this planned facility.
any violation of applicable anti-money laundering laws or regulations or the foreign corrupt practices act could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
we deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various jurisdictions' reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. both u.s. and macau governmental authorities focus heavily on the gaming industry and compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations. from time to time, the company receives governmental and regulatory inquiries about compliance with such laws and regulations. the company cooperates with all such inquiries. any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
further, we have operations, and a significant portion of our revenue is derived outside of the united states. we are therefore subject to regulations imposed by the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit u.s. companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. violations of the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the sec and u.s. department of justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to such laws and regulations.
internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our directors, employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. if we or our directors, employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our operations, the company may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions, which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. any such government investigations, prosecutions or other legal proceedings or actions could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
in february 2012, the company received a report detailing instances of conduct constituting prima facie violations of the foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") by kazuo okada (formerly the largest beneficial owner of wynn resorts' shares) and certain of his affiliates. while the company's regulators have not taken any action against the company in connection with the allegations in such report, a finding by regulatory authorities that mr. okada violated the fcpa on company property could result in actions by regulatory authorities against the company, which could negatively affect the company's financial condition and results of operations.
because we own real property, we are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.
we have incurred costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges into the air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. under these and other environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at our property. as an owner or operator, we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third
22
parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination.
these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. the liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. the costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use our property.
contamination has been identified at and in the vicinity of our site in everett, massachusetts. the ultimate cost of remediating contaminated sites is difficult to accurately predict and we exceeded our initial estimates. we may be required to conduct additional investigations and remediation with respect to this site. as a result, we also could incur material costs in excess of our estimates as a result of additional cleanup obligations imposed or contamination identified in the future. however, the environmental laws under which we operate are complicated and often increasingly more stringent, and may be applied retroactively. although our proposed expenditures related to environmental matters are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we may be required to make additional expenditures to remain in, or to achieve compliance with, environmental laws in the future.
compliance with changing laws and regulations may result in additional expenses and compliance risks.
changing laws and regulations are creating uncertainty for gaming companies. these changing laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, recent issuance and/or lack of guidance. as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. in addition, further regulation of casinos, financial institutions and public companies is possible. this could result in continuing uncertainty and higher costs regarding compliance matters. due to our commitment to maintain high standards of compliance with laws and public disclosure, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expense. in addition, we are subject to different parties' interpretation of our compliance with these new and changing laws and regulations.
we are subject to taxation by various governments and agencies. the rate of taxation could change.
we are subject to taxation by various governments and agencies, both in the u.s. and in macau. changes in the laws and regulations related to taxation, including changes in the rates of taxation, the amount of taxes we owe and the time when income is subject to taxation, our ability to claim u.s. foreign tax credits, failure to renew our macau dividend agreement and macau income tax exemption on gaming profits and the imposition of foreign withholding taxes could change our overall effective rate of taxation.
system failure, information leakage and the cost of maintaining sufficient cybersecurity could adversely affect our business.
we rely on information technology and other systems (including those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services) to maintain and transmit large volumes of customer financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information and other personally identifiable information. we also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. the systems and processes we have implemented to protect customers, employees and company information are subject to the ever-changing risk of compromised security. these risks include cyber and physical security breaches, system failure, computer viruses, and negligent or intentional misuse by customers, company employees, or employees of third-party vendors. the steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful and our insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties' information security operations.
despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, phishing attacks, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors and other events. cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly more difficult to anticipate and prevent due to their rapidly evolving nature and, as a result, the technology we use to protect our systems from being breached or compromised could become outdated due to advances in computer capabilities or other technological developments.
23
any perceived or actual electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third party, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to risks of litigation, significant fines and penalties and liability, result in the deterioration of our customers' and employees' confidence in us, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our employees, customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility and reduce our ability to attract and retain employees and customers. as these threats develop and grow, we may find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and our infrastructure, including the implementation of new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems, deployment of additional personnel and protection-related technologies, engagement of third-party consultants, and training of employees. the occurrence of any of the cyber incidents described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
the failure to protect the integrity and security of company employee and customer information could result in damage to reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data.
our business uses and transmits large volumes of employee and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personal information in various information systems that we maintain in areas such as human resources outsourcing, website hosting, and various forms of electronic communications. our customers and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. our collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations, and privacy law is an area that changes often and varies significantly by jurisdiction. for example, the european union (eu)'s general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), which became effective in may 2018 and replaced the old data protection laws of each eu member state, requires companies to meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data. the gdpr captures data processing by non-eu firms with no eu establishment as long as firms' processing relates to "offering goods or services" or the "monitoring" of individuals in the eu. in addition to governmental regulations, there are credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards we must comply with as well. compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. in addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us) or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. for example, failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to four percent of worldwide revenue. any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors.
our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
we are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including processing payments, accounting for and reporting financial results, and managing our employees and employee benefit programs. given the complexity of our business, it is imperative that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware and software systems. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses, technical malfunctions, inadequate system capacity, power outages, natural disasters, and usage errors by our employees or third-party consultants. if our information technology systems become damaged or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to repair or replace them. additionally, confidential or sensitive data related to our customers or employees could be lost or compromised. any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
if a third party successfully challenges our ownership of, or right to use, the wynn-related trademarks and/or service marks, our business or results of operations could be harmed.
our intellectual property assets, especially the logo version of "wynn," are among our most valuable assets. we have filed applications with the pto and with various foreign patent and trademark registries including registries in macau, china, hong kong, singapore, taiwan, japan, certain european countries and various other jurisdictions throughout the world, to register a variety of wynn-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. these marks include "wynn resorts," "wynn design and development," "wynn las vegas," "wynn macau," "wynn palace" and "encore." some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks in the future.
24
a common element of most of these marks is the use of the surname "wynn." as a general rule, a surname (or the portion of a mark primarily constituting a surname) is not eligible for registration unless the surname has acquired "secondary meaning." to date, we have been successful in demonstrating to the pto such secondary meaning for the wynn name, in certain of the applications, based upon factors including mr. wynn's historical prominence as a resort developer, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful with the other pending applications.
federal registrations are not completely dispositive of the right to such marks. third parties who claim prior rights with respect to similar marks may nonetheless challenge our right to obtain registrations or our use of the marks and seek to overcome the presumptions afforded by such registrations.
furthermore, due to the increased use of technology in computerized gaming machines and in business operations generally, other forms of intellectual property rights (such as patents and copyrights) are becoming of increased relevance. it is possible that, in the future, third parties might assert superior intellectual property rights or allege that their intellectual property rights cover some aspect of our operations. the defense of such allegations may result in substantial expenses, and, if such claims are successfully prosecuted, may have a material impact on our business. there has been an increase in the international operation of fraudulent online gambling and investment websites attempting to scam and defraud members of the public. we do not offer online gambling or investment accounts. websites offering these or similar activities and opportunities that use our names or similar names or images in likeness to ours, are doing so without our authorization and possibly unlawfully and with criminal intent. if our efforts to cause these sites to be shut down through civil action and by reporting these sites to the appropriate authorities (where applicable) are unsuccessful or not timely completed, these unauthorized activities may continue and harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. efforts we take to acquire and protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use throughout the world, which may include retaining counsel and commencing litigation in various jurisdictions, may be costly and may not be successful in protecting and preserving the status and value of our intellectual property assets.
labor actions and other labor problems could negatively impact our operations.
some of our employees are represented by labor unions. from time to time, we have experienced attempts by labor organizations to organize certain of our non-union employees. these efforts have achieved some success to date. we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and successful union activity in the future. the impact of any union activity is undetermined and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, including losses resulting from terrorism, and our insurance costs may increase.
we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary in their breadth and scope. however, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or could result in certain losses being totally uninsured. as a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated for debt or other financial obligations related to the property.
market forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain in the future or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. certain catastrophic losses may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. as a result, if we suffer such a catastrophic loss, we may not be successful in obtaining future insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels. furthermore, our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance. failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements, which would negatively affect our business and financial condition.
25
risks associated with our macau operations our macau operations may be affected by adverse political and economic conditions.
our macau operations are subject to significant political, economic and social risks inherent in doing business in an emerging market. the future success of our macau operations will depend on political and economic conditions in macau and mainland china. for example, fiscal decline, international relations, and civil, domestic or international unrest in macau, china or the surrounding region could significantly harm our business, not only by reducing customer demand for casino resorts, but also by increasing the risk of imposition of taxes and exchange controls or other governmental restrictions, laws or regulations that might impede our macau operations or our ability to repatriate funds.
revenues from our macau gaming operations will end if we cannot secure an extension or renewal of our concession, or a new concession, by june 26, 2022, or if the macau government exercises its redemption right.
the term of our concession agreement with the macau government ends on june 26, 2022. unless the term of our concession agreement is extended or our concession is renewed, subject to any separate arrangement with the macau government, all of our gaming operations and related equipment in macau will be automatically transferred to the macau government without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from these operations at the end of the term of our concession agreement. the macau government has publicly commented that it is studying the process by which concessions and subconcessions may be renewed, extended or issued. effective june 2017, the macau government may redeem our concession agreement by providing us at least one year's prior notice. in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right, we are entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption multiplied by the remaining years under our concession. we are considering various options to place us in a good position for the renewal, extension or application process; however, we may not be able to extend our concession agreement or renew our concession or obtain a new concession on terms favorable to us or at all. if our concession is redeemed, the compensation paid to us may not be adequate to compensate us for the loss of future revenues. the redemption of or failure to extend or renew our concession or obtain a new concession would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we compete for limited labor resources in macau and macau government policies may also affect our ability to employ imported labor.
the success of our operations in macau will be affected by our success in hiring and retaining employees. we compete with a large number of casino resorts in macau for a limited number of qualified employees. in addition, the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos. competition for these individuals in macau has increased and will continue to increase as other competitors expand their operations. we have to seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resorts and certain macau government policies affect our ability to import labor in certain job classifications. despite our coordination with the macau labor and immigration authorities to assure that our labor needs are satisfied, we may not be able to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees for our operations or obtain required work permits for those employees. if we are unable to obtain, attract, retain and train skilled employees, our ability to adequately manage and staff our existing and planned casino and resort properties in macau could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the smoking control legislation in macau could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in 2014, the macau government approved additional smoking control legislation, which prohibited smoking in casinos starting on october 6, 2014. the legislation, however, permitted casinos to maintain certain limited smoking areas open to vip patrons if certain stringent conditions were met, as enhanced from time to time. smoking was also permitted in approved smoking lounges if certain stringent technical standards were met. in 2017, the macau government approved additional smoking control legislation that came into effect on january 1, 2018 banning smoking in all casino areas other than in approved smoking lounges by december 31, 2018. the new smoking control legislation also requires casinos to upgrade any existing smoking lounges in mass gaming areas and construct new smoking lounges in vip gaming areas for inspection and approval in accordance with further enhanced technical standards by december 31, 2018. although we have approved smoking lounges at both wynn macau and wynn palace, the smoking ban may deter potential gaming customers who are smokers from frequenting casinos in macau and disrupt the number of patrons visiting or the amount of time visiting patrons spend gaming at our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
26
macau may not have adequate transportation services, infrastructure and related facilities to accommodate the demand of visitors to macau.
transportation services, infrastructure and related facilities within macau and between macau, hong kong and mainland china may need to be expanded to accommodate the increased visitation to macau driven by additional casino projects and attractions that are under construction and to be developed in the future as well as the opening of the hong kong-zhuhai-macau bridge which may further strain existing transportation infrastructure. if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau, the desirability of macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations of our macau operations, could be negatively impacted. furthermore, construction of current and future casino and infrastructure projects, adjacent to our properties could impede access to our properties during construction and development. this may negatively impact the results of our macau operations.
extreme weather conditions may have an adverse impact on our macau operations.
macau's subtropical climate and location on the south china sea are subject to extreme weather conditions including typhoons and heavy rainstorms, such as typhoon hato in 2017. unfavorable weather conditions could negatively affect the profitability of our resorts and prevent or discourage guests from traveling to macau.
if our macau operations fail to comply with the concession agreement, the macau government can terminate our concession without compensation to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate our concession in the event of our material non-compliance with the basic obligations under the concession and applicable macau laws. the concession agreement expressly provides that the government of macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement of our macau operations if it:
•   conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;
•   suspends gaming operations in macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;
•   defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;
•   does not comply with government inspections or supervision;
•   systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;
•   fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;
•   is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;
•   engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or
•   repeatedly violates applicable gaming laws.
if the government of macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement, our macau operations will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino space under macau law and all of the gaming equipment pertaining to our gaming operations will be transferred to the government without compensation. the loss of our concession would prohibit us from conducting gaming operations in macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
certain nevada gaming laws apply to our macau operations' gaming activities and associations.
certain nevada gaming laws also apply to gaming activities and associations in jurisdictions outside the state of nevada. with respect to our macau operations, we and our subsidiaries that must be licensed to conduct gaming operations in nevada are required to comply with certain reporting requirements concerning gaming activities and associations in macau conducted by our macau-related subsidiaries. we and our licensed nevada subsidiaries also will be subject to disciplinary action by the ngc if our macau-related subsidiaries:
•   knowingly violate any macau laws relating to their macau gaming operations;
•   fail to conduct our macau operations in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of nevada gaming operations;
•   engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable for us because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in nevada, reflects or tends to reflect discredit or disrepute upon the state of nevada or gaming in nevada, or is contrary to nevada gaming policies;
27
•   engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the state of nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or
•   employ, contract with or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in nevada on the ground of unsuitability, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.
such disciplinary action could include suspension, conditioning, limitation or revocation of the registration, licenses or approvals held by us and our licensed nevada subsidiaries, including wynn las vegas, llc, and the imposition of substantial fines.
in addition, if the nevada gaming control board determines that any actual or intended activities or associations of our macau-related subsidiaries may be prohibited pursuant to one or more of the standards described above, the nevada gaming control board can require us and our licensed nevada subsidiaries to file an application with the ngc for a finding of suitability of the activity or association. if the ngc finds that the activity or association in macau is unsuitable or prohibited, our macau-related subsidiaries will either be required to terminate the activity or association, or will be prohibited from undertaking the activity or association. consequently, should the ngc find that our macau-related subsidiary's gaming activities or associations in macau are unsuitable, those subsidiaries may be prohibited from undertaking their planned gaming activities or associations in macau, or be required to divest their investment in macau, possibly on unfavorable terms.
we depend upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of our gaming revenue. if we are unable to maintain, or develop additional, successful relationships with reputable gaming promoters, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues could be adversely affected.
we may lose the clientele of our gaming promoters, who generate a significant portion of our gaming revenue. there is intense competition among casino operators in macau for services provided by gaming promoters, which has intensified as additional casinos open in macau. if we are unable to maintain, or develop additional, successful relationships with reputable gaming promoters, or lose a significant number of our gaming promoters to our competitors, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues will be adversely affected and we will have to seek alternative ways of developing relationships with vip customers. in addition, if our gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our vip customers, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues will be hampered.
the financial resources of our gaming promoters may be insufficient to allow them to continue doing business in macau which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. our gaming promoters may experience difficulty in attracting patrons.
economic and political factors in the region may cause our gaming promoters to experience difficulties in their macau operations, including intensified competition in attracting patrons to come to macau. further, gaming promoters may face a decrease in liquidity, limiting their ability to grant credit to their patrons, and difficulties in collecting credit they extended previously. the inability to attract sufficient patrons, grant credit and collect amounts due in a timely manner may negatively affect our gaming promoters' operations, causing gaming promoters to wind up or liquidate their operations or resulting in some of our gaming promoters leaving macau. current and any future difficulties could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
increased competition for the services of gaming promoters may require us to pay increased commission rates to gaming promoters.
certain gaming promoters have significant leverage and bargaining strength in negotiating operational agreements with casino operators. this leverage could result in gaming promoters negotiating changes to our operational agreements, including higher commissions, or the loss of business to a competitor or the loss of certain relationships with gaming promoters. if we need to increase our commission rates or otherwise change our practices with respect to gaming promoters due to competitive forces, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
28
failure by the gaming promoters with whom we work to comply with macau gaming laws and high standards of probity and integrity might affect our reputation and ability to comply with the requirements of our concession, macau gaming laws and other gaming licenses.
the reputations and probity of the gaming promoters with whom we work are important to our own reputation and to our ability to operate in compliance with our concession, macau gaming laws and other gaming licenses. we conduct periodic reviews of the probity and compliance programs of our gaming promoters. however, we are not able to control our gaming promoters' compliance with these high standards of probity and integrity, and our gaming promoters may violate provisions in their contracts with us designed to ensure such compliance. in addition, if we enter into a new business relationship with a gaming promoter whose probity is in doubt, this may be considered by regulators or investors to reflect negatively on our own probity. if our gaming promoters are unable to maintain required standards of probity and integrity, we may face consequences from gaming regulators with authority over our operations. furthermore, if any of our gaming promoters violate the macau gaming laws while on our premises, the macau government may, in its discretion, take enforcement action against us, the gaming promoter, or each concurrently, and we may be sanctioned and our reputation could be harmed.
unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates may increase our macau operations' obligations under the concession agreement and cause fluctuations in the value of our investment in macau.
the currency delineated in our macau operations' concession agreement with the government of macau is the macau pataca. the macau pataca is linked to the hong kong dollar, and the two are often used interchangeably in macau. the hong kong dollar is linked to the u.s. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. however, the exchange linkages of the hong kong dollar and the macau pataca, and the hong kong dollar and the u.s. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to changes in chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.
if the hong kong dollar and the macau pataca are no longer linked to the u.s. dollar, the exchange rate for these currencies may severely fluctuate. the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies may also change.
because many of our macau operations' payment and expenditure obligations are in macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable macau pataca or hong kong dollar rate changes, our macau operations' obligations, as denominated in u.s. dollars, would increase. in addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that we operate in macau will be in hong kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the hong kong dollar and the u.s. dollar. also, if any of our macau-related entities incur u.s. dollar-denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the macau pataca or the hong kong dollar, in relation to the u.s. dollar, could have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service our debt.
currency exchange controls and currency export restrictions could negatively impact our macau operations.
currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of currency by certain countries may negatively impact the success of our macau operations. for example, there are currently existing currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of the renminbi, the currency of china. restrictions on the export of the renminbi may impede the flow of gaming customers from china to macau, inhibit the growth of gaming in macau and negatively impact our macau operations.
our macau subsidiaries' indebtedness is secured by a substantial portion of their assets.
subject to applicable laws, including gaming laws, and certain agreed upon exceptions, our macau subsidiaries' debt is secured by liens on substantially all of their assets. in the event of a default by such subsidiaries under their financing documents, or if such subsidiaries experience insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the holders of such secured debt would first be entitled to payment from their collateral security, and then would the holders of our macau subsidiaries' unsecured debt be entitled to payment from their remaining assets, and only then would we, as a holder of capital stock, be entitled to distribution of any remaining assets.
29
conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of wynn macau, limited.
wynn macau, limited, an indirect majority owned subsidiary of wynn resorts and the developer, owner and operator of wynn macau and wynn palace, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on the stock exchange of hong kong limited in october 2009. as of december 31, 2018, wynn resorts owns approximately 72% of wynn macau, limited's ordinary shares of common stock. as a result of wynn macau, limited having stockholders who are not affiliated with us, we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of wynn macau, limited may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of wynn macau, limited. decisions that could have different implications for wynn resorts and wynn macau, limited, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with wynn macau, limited, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest.
the macau government has established a maximum number of gaming tables that can be operated in macau and has limited the number of new gaming tables at new gaming areas in macau.
in connection with the opening of wynn palace, the dicj authorized 100 new table games for operation at wynn palace, with 25 additional table games authorized for operation on january 1, 2017, and a further 25 new table games for operation on january 1, 2018, for a total of 150 new table games in the aggregate. in addition, we have and will continue to transfer table games between wynn palace and wynn macau, subject to the aggregate cap. as of february 20, 2019, we had a total of 320 table games at wynn palace and 317 at wynn macau. the mix of table games in operation at wynn palace and wynn macau changes from time to time as a result of marketing and operating strategies in response to changing market demand and industry competition. failure to shift the mix of our table games in anticipation of market demands and industry trends may negatively impact our operating results.
risks related to share ownership and stockholder matters our largest stockholders are able to exert significant influence over our operations and future direction.
as of december 31, 2018, elaine p. wynn was our second largest shareholder and owned 9,539,077 shares, or approximately 9%, of our outstanding common stock. as a result, elaine p. wynn may be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring our stockholders' approval, including the approval of significant corporate transactions.
on august 3, 2018, we entered into a cooperation agreement (the "cooperation agreement") with elaine p. wynn regarding the composition of the company's board of directors and certain other matters, including, among other things, the appointment of mr. philip g. satre to the company's board of directors, standstill restrictions, releases, non-disparagement and reimbursement of expenses. the term of the cooperation agreement expires on the day after the conclusion of the 2020 annual meeting of the company's stockholders, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the circumstances described in the cooperation agreement.
our stock price may be volatile.
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as general united states, china, and world economic and financial conditions, our own quarterly variations in operating results, increased competition, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and changes affecting the travel industry, and other events impacting our business. the stock market in general, and prices for companies in our industry in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
30
risks related to our indebtedness we are highly leveraged and future cash flow may not be sufficient for us to meet our obligations, and we might have difficulty obtaining more financing.
we have a substantial amount of consolidated debt in relation to our equity. as of december 31, 2018, we had total outstanding debt of approximately $9.42 billion, which includes a portion of the funds we expect to need for the development and construction of our current projects. we may, however, incur additional indebtedness in connection with the construction of these projects. see item 1-business "construction and development opportunities." in addition, we are permitted to incur additional indebtedness if certain conditions are met, including conditions under our wynn macau credit facilities, our wynn america credit facilities and our wynn las vegas, llc indentures in connection with other future potential development plans.
our indebtedness could have important consequences. for example:
•   failure to meet our payment obligations or other obligations could result in acceleration of our indebtedness, foreclosure upon our assets that serve as collateral or bankruptcy and trigger cross defaults under other agreements;
•   servicing our indebtedness requires a substantial portion of our cash flow from the operations of our las vegas and macau operations and reduces the amount of available cash, if any, to fund working capital and other cash requirements or pay for other capital expenditures;
•   we may not be able to obtain additional financing, if needed; and
•   rates with respect to a portion of the interest we pay will fluctuate with market rates and, accordingly, our interest expense will increase if market interest rates increase.
the interest rates of certain of our credit agreements are tied to the london interbank offered rate, or libor. in july 2017, the head of the united kingdom financial conduct authority announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021. in addition, the u.s. federal reserve, in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee, a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions, is considering replacing u.s. dollar libor with the secured overnight financing rate, or sofr, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by treasury securities. although there have been a few issuances utilizing sofr or the sterling over night index average, an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, it is unknown whether these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for libor. if libor ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate any of our credit agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize libor as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that is established. there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate. as such, the potential effect of any such event could have on our business and financial condition cannot yet be determined.
under the terms of the documents governing our debt facilities, subject to certain limitations, we are permitted to incur indebtedness. if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above will be exacerbated.
the agreements governing our debt facilities contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.
some of our debt facilities require us to satisfy various financial covenants, which include requirements for minimum interest coverage ratios and leverage ratios pertaining to total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and a minimum earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. for more information on financial covenants we are subject to under our debt facilities, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 6, "long-term debt." future indebtedness or other contracts could contain covenants more restrictive than those contained in our existing debt facilities.
the agreements governing our debt facilities also contain restrictions on our ability to engage in certain transactions and may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. these restrictions include, among other things, limitations on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:
•   pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity;
•   incur additional debt;
•   make investments;
•   create liens on assets to secure debt;
•   enter into transactions with affiliates;
31
•   issue stock of, or member's interests in, subsidiaries;
•   enter into sale-leaseback transactions;
•   engage in other businesses;
•   merge or consolidate with another company;
•   undergo a change of control;
•   transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets;
•   issue disqualified stock;
•   create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and
•   designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries.
our ability to comply with the terms of our outstanding facilities may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events outside of our control. as a result, we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants. if our properties' operations fail to generate adequate cash flow, we may violate those covenants, causing a default under our agreements, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition or result in our lenders or holders of our debt taking action to enforce their security interests in our various assets or cause all outstanding amounts to be due and payable immediately.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the results presented reflect the company's adoption of the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition ("asc 606"), effective january 1, 2018. certain prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of asc 606, with no impact to operating income, net income or adjusted property ebitda.
overview we are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts (integrated resorts). in macau, we own approximately 72% of wml, which includes the operations of the wynn palace and wynn macau resorts. in las vegas, nevada, we operate and, with the exception of certain retail space, own 100% of wynn las vegas. we are currently constructing encore boston harbor, an integrated casino resort in everett, massachusetts.
key operating measures certain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which the consolidated statements of income are presented. these key operating measures are defined below:
•   table drop in mass market for our macau operations is the amount of cash that is deposited in a gaming table's drop box plus cash chips purchased at the casino cage.
•   table drop for our las vegas operations is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.
•   rolling chips are non-negotiable identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives within our macau operations' vip program.
•   turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our macau operations' vip program.
•   table games win is the amount of table drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenues. table games win is before discounts, commissions and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.
•   slot machine win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenues. slot machine win is after adjustment for progressive accruals and free play, but before discounts and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.
•   average daily rate ("adr") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms occupied.
•   revenue per available room ("revpar") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms available.
•   occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available.
below is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentages at our resorts.
in our vip operations in macau, customers primarily purchase rolling chips from the casino cage and can only use them to make wagers. winning wagers are paid in cash chips. the loss of the rolling chips in the vip operations is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating vip win percentage. it is customary in macau to measure vip play using this rolling chip method. we expect our win as a percentage of turnover from these operations to be within the range of 2.7% to 3.0%. in our mass market operations in macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage. the measurements from our vip and mass market operations are not comparable as the measurement method used in our mass market operations tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table and at the casino cage, while the measurement method from our vip operations tracks the sum of all losing wagers. accordingly, the base measurement from the vip operations is much larger than the base measurement from the mass market operations. as a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is lower in the vip operations when compared to the mass market operations.
in las vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables. the cash and net markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. this is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in las vegas. each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. our expected table games win percentage in las vegas is 22% to 26%.

the increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by increases in vip turnover and table drop at wynn palace. the increase at wynn palace was partially offset by decreases at wynn macau and our las vegas operations. the decrease at wynn macau was primarily driven by a lower vip table games win percentage. the decrease at our las vegas operations was primarily driven by a conversion of wholly owned retail outlets to leased retail outlets in december 2017 and lower table games win percentage. the following table presents operating revenues from our casino and non-casino revenues (dollars in thousands):

other non-operating income and expenses we incurred losses of $69.3 million and $59.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from the change in fair value of the redemption note prior to its repayment in march 2018. for more information on the methodology
43
and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the redemption note, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies." during the first quarter of 2018, we repaid the $1.94 billion principal amount of the redemption note.
we recorded a $0.1 million net gain on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2018 related to the repayment of the redemption note, offset by a loss on debt extinguishment associated with the amendment of the wynn macau credit facilities. we incurred a loss of $55.4 million on the extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2017. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we completed a cash tender offer and subsequent redemption of our 5 3/8% first mortgage notes due 2022 (the "2022 notes") and issued our 5 1/4% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 wlv notes"). we also completed a cash tender offer and subsequent redemption of our 5 1/4% senior notes ("2021 notes") and issued our 4 7/8% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 wml notes") and 5 1/2% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 wml notes"), together (the "wml notes"). we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt of $20.8 million in connection with the 2022 notes and 2027 wlv notes transactions and $33.1 million in connection with the wml notes transactions. additionally, in connection with an amendment of our wynn america credit facilities, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million.
we incurred losses of $4.1 million and $21.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from foreign currency remeasurements. the losses were primarily due to the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation of the macau pataca, in relation to the u.s. dollar, on the remeasurements of u.s. dollar denominated debt and other obligations from our macau-related entities.
income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded tax benefits of $497.3 million and $329.0 million, respectively. during the fourth quarter of 2018, the company finalized its analysis of u.s. tax reform, which was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and further clarified by guidance issued by the internal revenue service in the fourth quarter of 2018. the guidance addressed the treatment of foreign-sourced royalties and the allocation of interest expense and other expenses to foreign source income. as a result, the company adjusted its valuation allowance for ftc carryovers in the fourth quarter of 2018 and recorded a net tax benefit of $390.9 million, which is incremental to the $339.9 million provisional net tax benefit recorded in 2017 associated with u.s. tax reform.

we have participated in the internal revenue service ("irs") compliance assurance program ("cap") for the 2012 through 2018 tax years and will continue to participate in the irs cap for the 2019 tax year.
in february 2017 and 2018, the irs completed an examination of our 2015 and 2016 u.s. tax return, respectively, and had no changes.
in march 2017, the financial services bureau commenced an examination of the 2013 and 2014 macau income tax returns of wynn macau sa. in july 2018, the financial services bureau issued final tax assessments for the company for the years 2013 and 2014. while no additional tax was due, adjustments were made to the company's tax loss carryforwards.

casino expenses increased $835.7 million and $116.5 million at wynn palace and wynn macau, partially offset by a decrease of $2.5 million at our las vegas operations. the increase at wynn macau was driven by gaming taxes, which increased commensurate with the increase in casino revenues.
rooms expenses increased $29.6 million and $8.3 million at wynn palace and our las vegas operations, primarily attributable to expenses associated with the increase in occupancy and an increase in labor costs.
food and beverage expenses increased $57.9 million and $16.2 million at wynn palace and our las vegas operations, partially offset by wynn macau, which decreased $5.6 million. the increase from our las vegas operations was primarily driven by an increase in labor costs.
entertainment, retail and other expenses increased primarily due to a full year of operations at wynn palace.
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a full year of operations at wynn palace.
the provision for doubtful accounts was a benefit of $6.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to an expense of $8.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the change was due to the collection of certain casino accounts receivable that resulted in the reversal of previously recorded allowance for doubtful accounts.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we incurred pre-opening expenses of $25.9 million related to encore boston harbor and $0.2 million related to our las vegas operations. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we incurred $129.8 million related to wynn palace, $22.7 million related to encore boston harbor, and $2.3 million related to our las vegas operations.
depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to a full year of depreciation for wynn palace, which was placed in service in august 2016.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we incurred property charges and other expenses of $12.6 million and $6.7 million at wynn palace and wynn macau, respectively, primarily due to abandonment charges and asset retirements associated with various renovation projects and estimated costs related to property damage caused by a typhoon that impacted macau. in addition, we incurred $10.6 million in charges from our las vegas operations primarily related to miscellaneous renovations. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we incurred a $15.5 million exit fee for the right to procure energy for our las vegas operations from

for the year ended december 31, 2017, interest costs increased primarily due to an increase in the weighted average total debt balance. the increase in the weighted average total debt balance was primarily driven by borrowings under the wynn america credit facilities. capitalized interest decreased primarily due to the completion of wynn palace construction activities in august of 2016, and a $25.6 million out-of-period adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2016. during the first quarter of 2016, we corrected immaterial amounts of additional interest that should have been capitalized instead of being expensed during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.
other non-operating income and expenses we recorded a loss of $59.7 million and a gain of $65.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, from the change in fair value of the redemption note. the change in fair value was a result of changes in certain variables used to calculate its estimated fair value.
we recorded a gain of $1.1 million and a loss of $0.4 million from the change in the fair value of derivatives for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
interest income was $31.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $13.5 million for the same period of 2016. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, our short-term investment strategy was to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. the majority of our short-term investment amounts were in fixed deposits and money market accounts with a maturity of three months or less.
income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a tax expense of $329.0 million and $8.1 million, respectively. our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily related to a provisional tax benefit of $339.9 million resulting from the impact of u.s. tax reform on the company's deferred taxes. our income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily related to an increase in our deferred tax liabilities.
wynn macau sa received a five-year exemption from the macau complementary tax on casino gaming profits through december 31, 2020. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we were exempt from the payment of $63.0 million and $27.3 million, respectively, in such taxes. our non-gaming profits remain subject to the macau complementary tax and casino winnings remain subject to the macau special gaming tax and other levies together totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.
49
in august 2016, wynn macau sa received an extension of its agreement with the macau government that provides for an annual payment of 12.8 million macau patacas (approximately $1.6 million) as complementary tax due by stockholders on dividend distributions. this agreement on dividends is effective through december 31, 2020.
we have participated in the internal revenue service ("irs") compliance assurance program ("cap") for the 2012 through 2018 tax years and will continue to participate in the irs cap for the 2019 tax year. in february 2017 and 2018, the irs completed an examination of our 2015 and 2016 u.s. tax return, respectively, and had no changes.
in march 2017, the financial services bureau commenced an examination of the 2013 and 2014 macau income tax returns of wynn macau sa. as of december 31, 2017, we believed no changes to the unrecognized tax benefits were required.
in july 2017, the financial services bureau commenced an examination of the 2013 and 2014 macau income tax returns of palo real estate company limited ("palo"), a subsidiary of wynn macau sa. in february 2018, the financial services bureau concluded its examination with no changes.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $142.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $60.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. these amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interests' share of net income from wml.
adjusted property ebitda we use adjusted property ebitda to manage the operating results of our segments. adjusted property ebitda is net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, litigation settlement expense, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, (loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, change in derivatives fair value, change in redemption note fair value and other non-operating income and expenses. adjusted property ebitda is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. we use adjusted property ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. we also present adjusted property ebitda because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. gaming companies have historically reported ebitda as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their ebitda calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. however, adjusted property ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap. unlike net income, adjusted property ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property ebitda. also, our calculation of adjusted property ebitda may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
the following table summarizes adjusted property ebitda (in thousands) for our macau and las vegas operations as reviewed by management and summarized in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 16, "segment information." that footnote also presents a reconciliation of adjusted property ebitda to net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited.

adjusted property ebitda at wynn palace increased 60.0% for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017. since opening in august 2016, wynn palace has experienced significant business volume increases in both vip and mass market operations during its first two full years of operations. wynn palace operated for the final 132 days of 2016, which does not compare meaningfully to 2017.
adjusted property ebitda at wynn macau decreased 3.6% for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, primarily due to a decrease in vip win as a percentage of turnover, partially offset by increases in mass market table games win and slot machine win. adjusted property ebitda at wynn macau increased 11.6% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016, primarily due to improved vip operations driven by a year-over-year increase in vip turnover.
adjusted property ebitda at our las vegas operations decreased 10.6% for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, primarily due to decreased table and slot win and increased operating expenses. adjusted property ebitda at our las vegas operations increased 10.0% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016, primarily due to improved casino operations and food and beverage operations.

operating activities our operating cash flows primarily consist of the operating income generated by our macau and las vegas operations (excluding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges), interest paid and earned, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses and payables. our table games play both in macau and las vegas is a mix of cash play and credit play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. a significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium international customers who gamble on credit. the ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail, and other revenue is conducted on a cash and credit basis. accordingly, operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivable.
net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $961.5 million, compared to $1.88 billion for the same period of 2017. the decrease was primarily driven by a litigation settlement expense and a reduction in customer deposits at our macau operations.
net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $1.88 billion, compared to $970.5 million for the same period of 2016. the increase was primarily due to the operations of wynn palace, which generated $424.5 million of additional adjusted property ebitda, and a $292.8 million increase in customer deposits at wynn palace.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $1.22 billion, primarily attributable to $1.48 billion in capital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention, driven by capital expenditures of $791.3 million related

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates and on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.
development, construction and property and equipment estimates during the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. in connection with the construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs.
during the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, estimates of the usage of the asset and other factors specific to the asset. depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs and fixed assets commence when the related assets are placed in service. the remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. the cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in property charges and other.
we also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. for assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. in reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.
redemption price promissory note we recorded the redemption note at its fair value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. as of december 31, 2017, the fair value of the redemption note was $1.88 billion. we utilized an independent third party valuation to assist in the determination of this fair value. in determining this fair value, we estimated the redemption note's present value using discounted cash flows with a probability-weighted expected return for redemption assumptions and a discount rate, which included time value and non-performance risk adjustments commensurate with the risk of the redemption note. in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used in the estimated present value, the redemption note's subordinated position and credit risk relative to all other debt in our capital structure and credit ratings associated with our traded debt were considered. observable inputs for the risk-free rate based on federal reserve rates for u.s. treasury securities and credit risk spread based on a yield curve index of similarly rated debt were used. the company repaid the principal amount in full on march 30, 2018.

allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable a substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our las vegas operations. while offered, the issuance of credit at our macau operations is less significant when compared to las vegas. our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. these collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and litigation. markers issued at our las vegas operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states, and united states assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the united states.
the enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the united states varies from country to country. some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. we closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the united states. in addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both las vegas and macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.
as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, 85.0% and 81.7%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in asia. in addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given to foreign customers is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries.
we regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts and outstanding gaming promoter accounts as well as management's prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. in determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply loss factors based on historical marker collection history to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information.
the following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (dollars in thousands):

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable              31,263                28,841
allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable          13.6   %              16.6   %
our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, 57.9% and 42.4%, respectively, of our outstanding casino accounts receivable balance originated at our macau operations.
as of december 31, 2018, a 100 basis point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.3 million.
as our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts may fluctuate. because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a region's economy or legal system.
litigation and contingency estimates we are subject to various claims, legal actions and other contingencies, and we accrue for these matters when they are both probable and estimable. for matters that arose on or prior to the balance sheet date, we estimate any accruals based on the relevant facts and circumstances available through the date of issuance of the financial statements. we include the accruals associated with any contingent matters in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities generally is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.
as of december 31, 2018, we have a foreign tax credit ("ftc") carryover of $3.19 billion and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.49 billion against this asset based on our estimate of future realization. the ftcs are attributable to the macau special gaming tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in macau. in the assessment of the valuation allowance, appropriate consideration was given to all positive and negative evidence including recent operating profitability, forecasts of future earnings and the duration of statutory carryforward periods.
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. the accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. these accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
as applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.

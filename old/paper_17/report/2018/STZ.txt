item 1a. risk factors.
in addition to information discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations. the risks described below are not the only risks we face. additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations in future periods.
operational risks international operations, worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, geopolitical uncertainty, or changes to international trade agreements and tariffs, import and excise duties, other taxes, or other governmental rules and regulations our products are produced and sold in numerous countries, we have employees in various countries and we have production facilities currently in the u.s., mexico, new zealand, italy and canada.
risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, include:
•   changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;
•   potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;
•   restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;
•   import and export requirements;
•   currency exchange rate fluctuations;
•   a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which, among other things, can create uncertainty regarding contract enforcement, intellectual property rights, real property rights, and liability issues; and
•   inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the foreign corrupt practices act.
unfavorable global or regional economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets, as well as unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation, could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products. these could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers. the inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.
10
we are also exposed to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. we could experience changes in our ability to manage fluctuations in interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.
we could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems, intergovernmental disputes or animus against the united states. any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable u.s. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.
the u.s. and other countries in which we operate impose duties, excise taxes, and/or other taxes on beverage alcohol products, and/or on certain raw materials used to produce our beverage alcohol products, in varying amounts. the u.s. federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on, or that impact, beverage alcohol products could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.
in addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. certain federal, state or local regulations also require warning labels and signage. new or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations. additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what our products contain or allegations that our products cause adverse health effects. if these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.
these international, economic and political uncertainties and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.
dependence on limited facilities for production of our mexican beer brands, and expansion and construction issues we are dependent on our nava and obregon breweries as our sole sources of supply to fulfill our mexican beer brands product requirements, both now as well as for the near term.
we are currently expanding our obregon brewery and constructing our mexicali brewery, and our joint venture with owens-illinois is expanding its glass plant. while these multi-million-dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans, there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns.
expansion of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i)  our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii)  potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii)  inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; and (iv)  inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel. any of these events could delay the expansion or construction of our production facilities.
we may not be able to satisfy our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant disruption, partial destruction or total destruction of the nava or obregon breweries or the glass plant, or
11
difficulty shipping raw materials and product into or out of the united states. also, if the contemplated expansions of the obregon brewery and the glass plant and construction of the mexicali brewery are not completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our mexican beer to satisfy our needs. under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain our mexican beer at a reasonable price from another source, if at all. a significant disruption at our nava or obregon breweries, or the glass plant, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis. alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.
operational disruptions or catastrophic loss to breweries, wineries, other production facilities or distribution systems all of our mexican beer brands product supply is currently produced at our breweries in nava, coahuila, mexico and obregon, sonora, mexico. many of the workers at these breweries are covered by collective bargaining agreements. the glass plant currently produces approximately half of the total annual glass bottle supply for our mexican beer brands. several of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, including certain california wineries and breweries and our planned mexicali brewery, are in areas prone to seismic activity. additionally, we have various vineyards, wineries and breweries in the state of california which has recently experienced wildfires and landslides.
if any of these or other of our properties and production facilities were to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties. also, our production facilities are asset intensive. as our operations are concentrated in a limited number of production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss in any one location from acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, labor strike or other labor activities, cyber-attacks and other attempts to penetrate our information technology systems, unavailability of raw or packaging materials, or other natural or man-made events. if a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations could be adversely affected due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending or product supply constraints.
our insurance policies do not cover certain types of catastrophes. economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain property damage and business interruption insurance. if our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations. if one or more significant uninsured or under-insured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.
supply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottles the quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business. water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints. we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, our wineries and our distilleries, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations. the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields. if water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarce or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints. in addition, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards. a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, such as barley or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.
12
we have substantial brewery operations in the country of mexico, brewery operations in the states of california, texas, virginia and florida, and we currently have substantial wine operations in the state of california as well. in the past, california had endured an extended period of drought and instituted restrictions on water usage. a recurrence of severe drought conditions in california could have an adverse effect upon those operations, which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions. our nava brewery and glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer. our obregon brewery receives its allocation of water originating from an aquifer and we expect our mexicali brewery will receive an allocation of water originating from an aquifer. although we anticipate our operations will have adequate sources of water to support their on-going requirements, there is no guarantee that the sources of water, methods of water delivery, or water requirements will not change materially in the future.
our breweries, the glass plant, our wineries and our distilleries use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products. these include corn starch and sugars, malt, hops, fruits, yeast and water for our breweries; soda ash and silica sand for the glass plant; grapes and water for our wineries; and grain and water for our distilleries. our breweries, wineries and distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products. our production facilities also use electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel in their operations. certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities. the supply and price of raw materials, packaging materials and energy can be affected by many factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions or natural or man-made events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft.
our breweries, wineries and distilleries are also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles. glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. we currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our mexican beer brands. in the u.s., glass bottles have only a small number of producers. currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our u.s. wine and spirits operations and two producers supply our glass bottles for our craft beer.
to the extent any of the foregoing factors increases the costs of our finished products or lead to a shortage of our product supply, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.
reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agencies local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the beer, wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio. in the u.s., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets and directly to government agencies, and we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our u.s. wine and spirits net sales. wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases, and wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors. the replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.
reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networks, cyber-attacks, and design and implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system ("erp")
we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and effect accurate and timely governmental reporting. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or penalties associated with the failure to timely file governmental reports. we recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have
13
experienced increases in security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other hacking activities such as denial of service, malware, and ransomware. as with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by increasingly sophisticated outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers. such unauthorized access could disrupt our operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.
we have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future. we rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis. however, we do not ultimately control their performance. their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations.
we are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new erp system which we intend to replace our existing operating and financial systems in fiscal 2020 and 2021. we are designing the erp system to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business. we expect the implementation process will require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. companies which implement new erp systems may experience delays, increased costs and other difficulties. if we are not successful in designing and implementing our erp system as planned or if it does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, or we may not be able to operate our business.
to the extent any of the foregoing factors result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, or reduce the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.
contamination and degradation of product quality from diseases, pests and weather conditions our success depends upon the positive image that consumers have of our brands and of the safety and quality of our products. contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales. various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply and quality of our products. we cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire. future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops. it is also possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.
product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials or product components obtained from suppliers, may also reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. contaminants or other defects in raw materials, packaging materials or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all our brands.
if any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded, or cause injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs. a widespread product recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.
14
climate change and environmental regulatory compliance our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources. there has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. severe weather events, such as drought or flooding in california or a prolonged cold winter in new york, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials. decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products. severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers. natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes may also negatively impact the ability of consumers to purchase our products.
we may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements for our operating facilities to meet environmental regulatory requirements. in addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or relating to historical activities of businesses we acquire. due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated. we may incur costs associated with environmental compliance arising from events we cannot control, such as unusually severe floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or fires. we cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have a material adverse effect upon our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.
cannabis is currently illegal under u.s. federal law and in other jurisdictions; we do not control canopy's business or operations the ability of canopy to achieve its business objectives is contingent, in part, upon the legality of the cannabis industry, canopy's compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by various governmental authorities, and canopy obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the production and sale of its products. the laws and regulations governing medical and recreational cannabis are still developing, including in ways that we may not foresee. although the agriculture improvement act of 2018 has taken hemp and hemp derived cannabinoids out of the most restrictive class of controlled substances, marijuana is a schedule-1 controlled substance in the u.s. and is currently illegal under u.s. federal law. even in those u.s. states in which the recreational use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of u.s. federal law. since u.s. federal laws criminalizing the use of marijuana preempt state laws that legalize its use, continuation of u.s. federal law in its current state regarding marijuana would likely limit the expansion of canopy's business into the u.s. similar issues of illegality apply in other countries. any amendment to or replacement of existing laws to make them more onerous, or delays in amending or replacing existing laws to liberalize the legal possession and use of cannabis, or delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, any necessary regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact negatively canopy's markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on canopy's business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations. were that to occur, we may not be able to recover the value of our investments in canopy.
we have the right to nominate four members of the canopy board of directors. while we do not control canopy's business or operations, we do rely on canopy's internal controls and procedures for operation of that business. nevertheless, our financing arrangements require us to certify, among other things, that to our knowledge (i)  canopy is properly licensed and operating in accordance with canadian laws in all material respects; (ii)  canopy does not knowingly or intentionally purchase, manufacture, distribute, import and/or sell marijuana or any other controlled substance in or from the united states of america or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, manufacture, distribution, importation or sale of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws, rules and regulations; and (iii)  canopy does not knowingly or intentionally partner with, invest in, or distribute marijuana or any other controlled substance to any third-party that knowingly or intentionally purchases, sells, manufactures, or distributes marijuana or any other controlled substance in the united states of america or any other jurisdiction, in each case,
15
where such purchase, sale, manufacture or distribution of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws, rules and regulations. were we to know that canopy was knowingly or intentionally violating any of these applicable laws, we would be unable to make the required certification under our financing arrangements, which could lead to a default under those financing arrangements.
strategic risks competition we are in a highly competitive industry and our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:
•   our inability to maintain or increase prices;
•   new entrants in our market or categories;
•   the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase competitors' products instead of ours; or
•   a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption due to consumer dietary preference changes or consumers substituting legalized marijuana or other similar products in lieu of beverage alcohol.
sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and other local agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products. we could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our prices to pass along to our customers any increased costs we incur.
potential decline in the consumption of products we sell; dependence on sales of our mexican beer brands our business depends upon consumers' consumption of our beer, wine and spirits brands, and sales of our mexican beer brands in the u.s. are a significant portion of our business. accordingly, a decline in the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the u.s. could adversely affect our business. further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value. consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste in our major markets away from our beer, wine and spirits brands, and our mexican beer brands in particular, from the categories in which they compete could have a negative impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations. consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns. a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:
•   a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;
•   concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;
•   a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;
•   the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;
•   increased federal, state, provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;
•   increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax or changes to international trade agreements or tariffs;
•   inflation; and
•   wars, pandemics, weather and natural or man-made disasters.
16
acquisition, divestiture, investment, and new product development strategies from time to time, we acquire businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe will provide a strategic fit with our business. we integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems. if the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations. we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or within the anticipated costs or timeframes, retain key customers and suppliers or key employees of acquired businesses, or successfully implement our business plan for the combined business. in addition, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates and we may fail to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities or other potential synergies. we cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses or investments will remain constant.
we may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business. we may provide various indemnifications in connection with the divestiture of businesses or assets. divestitures of portions of our business may also result in costs stranded in our remaining business. delays in developing or implementing plans to address such costs could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our financial objectives.
we have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as our joint venture to operate a glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery, our interest in canopy, and investments made through our corporate ventures capital function. our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies. our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners' obligations, or to purchase other parties' interests.
we recently increased our investment in canopy. while we will not develop, distribute, manufacture or sell cannabis products in the u.s., or anywhere else in the world, unless it is legally permissible to do so at all governmental levels in the particular jurisdiction, this investment could affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation with various constituencies.
in addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products. the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal. the launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation. unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.
we cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures or investments. we also cannot assure you that our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture or investment activities will be accurate. our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with acquisitions or divestitures, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.
sale of a portion of our wine and spirits business as previously announced, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices and facilities. the divestiture of this portion of our business will enable us to focus on our higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. the wine and spirits transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval, and we cannot guarantee the transaction will
17
occur on the terms, conditions or timetable that we currently anticipate. we intend to use the net proceeds from this transaction primarily to reduce our outstanding borrowings. a delay in completing this transaction, or the failure to complete this transaction, could delay the accomplishment of our strategic and financial objectives. moreover, the wine and spirits transaction will reduce the diversification of our portfolio. we may not fully realize the expected benefits of a portfolio of higher-end wine and spirits brands.
our canopy investments are dependent upon an emerging market and legal sales of cannabis products the legal cannabis market is an emerging market. the legislative framework pertaining to the canadian cannabis market, as well as cannabis markets in other countries, is uncertain. the success of the canopy transactions will depend on, among other things, the ability of canopy to create a strong platform for us to operate successfully in the cannabis market space. there is no assurance a robust cannabis consumer market will develop consistent with our expectations or that consumers will purchase any canopy products.
a failure in the demand for canopy's products to materialize as a result of competition, consumer desire, competition from legal and illegal market entrants or other products, or other factors could have a material adverse effect on canopy's business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations. were that to occur, we may have to write down the value of our investments in canopy. the changing legal landscape and the lack of consumer market data makes it difficult to predict the pace at which the cannabis market may grow, if at all, and the products that consumers will purchase in the cannabis marketplace.
for example, the canadian cannabis act prohibits testimonials, lifestyle branding and packaging that is appealing to youth. the restrictions on advertising, marketing and the use of logos and brand names could have a material adverse effect on canopy's business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, and our investment in canopy.
additionally, canopy must rely on its own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts may not be fully available at this early stage in the cannabis industry in canada and globally. market research relating to the adult-use recreational legal cannabis industry is in its early stages and, as such, trends can only be forecasted.
dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rights our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. we have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products. we cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications. we could also, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark and our competitors could challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.
financial risks indebtedness we have incurred indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, fund beer operations expansion and construction activities and repurchase shares of our common stock. in the future, we may continue to incur additional indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and fund other general corporate purposes, including beer operations expansion and construction activities. we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, and fund our general corporate and capital requirements.
18
our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences. these consequences include, or may include, the following:
•   our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or investments/acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;
•   our funds available for operations, expansions and construction, dividends or other distributions, or stock repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;
•   our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and
•   our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.
additionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings. a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper. certain of our debt facilities also contain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt.
if we fail to comply with the obligations contained in our senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures, or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such debt facilities or agreements. in the event of a default, the holders of our debt could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such instrument to be due and payable. a default could also require the immediate repayment of outstanding obligations under other debt facilities or agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. if that were to occur, we might not have available funds to satisfy such repayment obligations.
intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks we have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future. intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards. the write-down of any of these intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.
changes to tax laws, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes, and changes to accounting standards, elections or assertions the u.s. federal budget and individual state, provincial, local municipal budget deficits, or deficits in other governmental entities, could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers. various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state levels or at other governmental bodies in recent years. federal, state, provincial, local or foreign governmental entities may consider increasing taxes upon beverage alcohol products as they explore available alternatives for raising funds.
on december 22, 2017, the tcj act was signed into law in the united states. the changes in the tcj act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the tcj act may have on our business and financial results.
in addition, significant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions. our provision for income taxes includes a provision for uncertain tax positions. fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results. when tax matters arise, several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase our effective tax rate and resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
additional u.s. tax changes or in how international corporations are taxed, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or changes to accounting standards, elections or assertions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.
19
securities measured at fair value the value of the warrants and convertible debt we hold in canopy through our subsidiaries is subject to the volatility of the market price of canopy's common stock. this volatility subjects our financial statements to volatility. the market price of canopy's common stock has experienced significant volatility, and that volatility may continue in the future and may also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors beyond the control of canopy, or of us. these factors include, but are not limited to:
•   actual or anticipated fluctuations in canopy's reported results of operations;
•   recommendations by securities analysts;
•   changes in the market valuations of companies in the industry in which canopy operates;
•   announcement of developments and material events by canopy or its competitors;
•   fluctuations in the costs of vital production materials and services;
•   addition or departure of canopy executive officers or other key personnel;
•   news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in canopy's industry or target markets;
•   regulatory changes affecting the cannabis industry generally and canopy's business and operations; and
•   administrative obligations associated with health canada requirements and compliance with all associated rules and regulations including, but not limited to, the canadian cannabis act.
we recently agreed to modify the terms of certain warrants we hold in canopy which, if modified, would among other things extend the expiry of those warrants and extend the time period through which the value of those warrants and our financial statements are subject to the volatility of the market price of canopy's common stock.
canopy's corporate governance canopy's business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that may from time to time increase both canopy's compliance costs and the risk of its non-compliance. these include changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including, but not limited to, the canadian securities administrators, the tsx, the international accounting standards board, the sec and the nyse. these rules continue to evolve in scope and complexity creating new requirements for canopy. canopy is currently exempt from certain nyse corporate governance requirements because it is a foreign private issuer listed on the nyse and registered with the sec and is subject to canadian requirements. when canopy registered with the sec, it did not need to test its internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 ("sox") that require management of canopy to perform an annual assessment of the effectiveness of canopy's internal control over financial reporting and its registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report as to the effectiveness of such controls. the future application of sox to canopy will require management of canopy to perform an annual assessment of canopy's internal control over financial reporting and its registered public accounting firm to conduct an independent assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. canopy has disclosed a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting. canopy may not be able to remediate the material weakness timely. also, canopy's internal controls may not be adequate, or canopy may not be able to maintain adequate internal controls as required by sox. canopy may not be able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis if standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time. if canopy does not satisfy sox requirements on an ongoing and timely basis, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of its financial statements, which could harm canopy's business and have a negative impact on the trading price or market value of canopy securities.
other risks damage to our reputation the success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands and maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products. contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for
20
our brands, could adversely affect their sales and our reputation. our reputation could also be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:
•   a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all our operations and activities;
•   a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;
•   allegations that we, or persons associated with us or formerly associated with us, have violated applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to those related to safety, employment, discrimination, harassment, whistle-blowing, privacy, or cyber-security;
•   our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or
•   efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol or cannabis.
failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations, maintain an effective system of internal controls, provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.
class action or other litigation relating to abuse of our products, the misuse of our products, product liability, or marketing or sales practices there has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. we could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices. adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

overview we are an international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred, high-end imported and craft beer brands, and higher-end wine and spirits brands. we are the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the u.s. market and a leading, higher-end wine company in the u.s. market. we are the largest multi-category supplier (beer, wine and spirits) of beverage alcohol in the u.s., and a leading supplier of wine from new zealand and italy to north america.
our internal management financial reporting consists of two business divisions:  (i)  beer and (ii)  wine and spirits, and we report our operating results in three segments:  (i)  beer, (ii)  wine and spirits, and (iii)  corporate operations and other. in the beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported and craft beer brands. we have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market and sell in the u.s. our mexican beer portfolio. in the wine and spirits segment, our portfolio includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. amounts included in the corporate operations and other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and information technology, as well as our investments in canopy and those made through our corporate venture capital function. all costs included in the corporate operations and other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments. all costs reported within the corporate operations and other segment are not included in our chief operating decision maker's evaluation of the operating income performance of the other reportable segments. the business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.
strategy our overall strategy is to drive industry-leading growth and shareholder value by building brands that people love when celebrating big moments or enjoying quiet ones. we position our portfolio to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization, which we believe will continue to result in faster growth rates in the higher-end of the beer, wine and spirits categories. we focus on developing our expertise in consumer insights and category management as well as our strong distributor network, which provides an effective route-to-market. additionally, we leverage our scale across the total beverage alcohol market and our level of diversification hedges our portfolio risk. in addition to growing our existing business, we focus on targeted acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses that are higher-margin, higher-growth, consumer-led, have a low integration risk and/or fill a gap in our portfolio. we also strive to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics (see "recent developments" and "investments, acquisitions and divestitures - canopy investments" below).
we strive to strengthen our portfolio of higher-end beer, wine and spirits brands and differentiate ourselves through:
•   leveraging our leading position in total beverage alcohol and our scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio and to provide for cross promotional opportunities;
•   strengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights;
•   investing in brand building and innovation activities;
•   positioning ourselves for success with consumer-led products that identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics;
•   realizing operating efficiencies through expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and
•   developing employees to enhance performance in the marketplace.
our business strategy for the beer segment focuses on leading the high-end segment of the u.s. beer market and includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the u.s. through expanding distribution for key
26
brands, as well as new product development and innovation within the existing portfolio of brands, and continued expansion, construction and optimization activities for our mexico beer operations. additionally, in an effort to more fully compete in growing sectors of the high-end segment of the u.s. beer market, we've made several acquisitions of high-quality, regional craft beer brands and leveraged our innovation capabilities to introduce new brands that align with consumer trends.
in connection with our business strategy for the beer segment, we have more than tripled the production capacity of our nava brewery since its june 2013 acquisition. in addition, construction of the mexicali brewery is progressing and we are continuing to invest to expand the obregon brewery, which was acquired in december 2016. expansion, construction and optimization efforts continue under our previously-announced mexico beer expansion projects (as defined below in "capital expenditures") to align with our anticipated future growth expectations (see "capital expenditures" below).
our business strategy for the wine and spirits segment is to build an industry-leading portfolio of higher-end wine and spirits brands. we are investing to meet the evolving needs of consumers; building brands through consumer insights, sensory expertise and innovation; and refreshing existing brands, as we continue to focus on moving our branded wine and spirits portfolio towards a higher-margin, higher-growth portfolio of brands. we dedicate a large share of our sales and marketing resources to our u.s. focus brands as they represent a majority of our u.s. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally hold strong positions in their respective price categories. we focus our innovation and investment dollars on those brands within our portfolio which position us to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization. additionally, in connection with the wine and spirits transaction, we expect to optimize the value of our wine and spirits portfolio by driving increased focus on our higher-end priority brands to accelerate growth and improve overall operating margins. in markets where it is feasible, we entered into contractual arrangements to consolidate our u.s. distribution network in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our u.s. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. this consolidated u.s. distribution network currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the u.s. throughout the terms of these contracts, we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors to essentially equal the distributors' shipments to retailers.
marketing, sales and distribution of our products are managed on a geographic basis in order to fully leverage leading market positions. in addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i)  our beer portfolio and (ii)  our wine and spirits portfolio. the environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.
within our corporate operations and other segment, we complemented our total beverage alcohol strategy in an adjacent category by making investments in canopy, a world-leading, diversified cannabis company. these investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property and retailing.
we remain committed to our long-term financial model of growing sales, expanding margins and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth, maintain our targeted leverage ratio and pay quarterly cash dividends.
recent developments wine and spirits transaction in april 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices and facilities, for approximately $1.7 billion, subject to certain adjustments. the wine and spirits transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval. we expect to use the net cash proceeds from this transaction primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings. we are in the process of
27
developing a plan to eliminate any remaining costs in the wine and spirits segment from the brands we are selling and expect to incur a restructuring charge for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. we expect the wine and spirits transaction to close around the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020. the wine and spirits transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands.
we are selling approximately $1.3 billion in tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, in connection with the wine and spirits transaction. selected financial information included in our results of operations for fiscal 2019 for the portion of the wine and spirits business we expect to sell is as follows:
net sales           gross profit         marketing

canopy warrants modification in april 2019, we agreed to modify the terms of the november 2018 canopy warrants and certain other rights. modification of the november 2018 canopy warrants is subject to, among other things, approval by canopy's shareholders. these changes are a result of canopy's intention to acquire acreage holdings, inc. upon u.s. federal cannabis legalization, subject to certain conditions. we expect the new november 2018 canopy warrants to be accounted for at fair value. if canopy shareholder approval is received, we expect the modifications to the november 2018 canopy warrants will result in a fair value adjustment related to the warrants. additionally, we expect the fair value of the new november 2018 canopy warrants to be volatile in future periods. for additional information regarding the canopy warrants modification, see note 10 of the notes to the financial statements.

(2)   includes $17.2 million of direct acquisition costs capitalized under the equity method cost accumulation model. excludes $7.3 million of direct acquisition costs associated with the investment in warrants which are expensed as incurred in selling, general and administrative expenses. see "financial liquidity and capital resources - general" for a discussion of financing for this transaction.
we expect the fair value of the canopy investments accounted for at fair value to be volatile in future periods. equity in earnings (losses) for our canopy equity method investment are reported in the corporate operations and other segment and are expected to be volatile in future periods. additionally, since november 1, 2018 we recognize equity in earnings (losses) for our canopy equity method investment on a two-month lag. accordingly, we recognized our share of canopy's losses from november and december 2018, which was included in canopy's third quarter fiscal 2019 results, in our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results.
as of february 28, 2019, the conversion of canopy equity securities held by its employees and/or held by other third parties would not have a significant effect on our share of canopy's reported earnings or losses. additionally, under an amended and restated investor rights agreement, we have the option to purchase additional common shares of canopy at the then-current price of the underlying equity security to allow us to maintain our relative ownership interest.
as previously noted, these investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property and retailing.
beer segment four corners acquisition in july 2018, we acquired four corners, which primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill, property, plant and equipment, and trademarks. this acquisition included a portfolio of high-quality, dynamic and bicultural, texas-based craft beers which further strengthened our position in the high-end segment of the u.s. beer market. the results of operations of four corners are reported in the beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

wine and spirits segment schrader cellars acquisition in june 2017, we acquired schrader cellars, which primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, inventories, trademarks and certain grape supply contracts. this acquisition included a collection of highly-rated, limited-production fine wines which aligned with our strategic focus on higher-end wine and spirits brands and strengthened our position in the fine wine category. the results of operations of schrader cellars are reported in the wine and spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
canadian divestiture in december 2016, we sold our canadian wine business, which included canadian wine brands such as jackson-triggs and inniskillin, wineries, vineyards, offices, facilities and wine rack retail stores, at a transaction value of c$1.03 billion, or $775.1 million. accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of our canadian wine business through the date of divestiture. we received cash proceeds of $570.3 million, net of outstanding debt and direct costs to sell. we will continue to export certain of our brands into the canadian market, which remains our largest export market. this transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands. we recognized a net gain on the sale of the business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 of $262.4 million.
selected financial information included in our historical financial statements for fiscal 2017 that are no longer part of our results after the canadian divestiture is as follows:

for additional information on these investments, acquisitions and divestitures, refer to notes 2, 7 and 10 of the notes to the financial statements.
results of operations financial highlights references to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of acquired brand activity in connection with our more significant acquisitions, consisting of prisoner, high west and charles smith (wine and spirits), and divested brand activity in connection with the canadian divestiture (wine and spirits), as appropriate.
financial highlights for fiscal 2019:
•   our results of operations benefited primarily from continued improvements within the beer segment, an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our investments in canopy and a net gain on the sale of the accolade wine investment.
•   net sales increased 7% primarily due to an increase in beer net sales driven predominantly by volume growth and a favorable impact from pricing within our mexican beer portfolio.
•   operating income increased 6% largely due to the net sales volume growth and favorable impact from pricing within our mexican beer portfolio. operating income growth was tempered by planned increases in marketing spend and higher cost of product sold across both the beer and wine and spirits segments.
•   net income attributable to cbi and diluted net income per common share attributable to cbi increased significantly primarily due to the factors discussed above.
comparable adjustments management excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these comparable adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. segment operating performance and segment management compensation are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss). as such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these comparable adjustments.

cost of product sold accelerated depreciation we recognized accelerated depreciation for certain assets primarily in connection with our current multi-year implementation of a new erp system which is intended to replace our existing operating and financial systems.
undesignated commodity derivative contracts net gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts represents a net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of undesignated commodity derivative contracts. the net gain (loss) is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. at settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the results of our operating segments to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.
inventory step-up in connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventories on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up. inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired business prior to acquisition.

loss on inventory write-down we recognized a loss on the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the fall 2017 california wildfires (fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018).
selling, general and administrative expenses impairment of intangible assets we recognized trademark impairment losses related to our beer segment's ballast point craft beer trademark asset (fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018) and certain of our wine and spirits trademark assets associated with our decision to discontinue certain small-scale, low-margin u.s. brands (fiscal 2017). see "costs associated with the canadian divestiture and related activities" below for information about an additional impairment of intangible assets recognized in connection with the canadian divestiture. for additional information, refer to note 7 of the notes to the financial statements.
net loss on foreign currency derivative contracts associated with acquisition of investment we recognized a net loss in connection with the settlement of foreign currency option contracts entered into to fix the u.s. dollar cost of the november 2018 canopy transaction.
restructuring and other strategic business development costs we recognized costs primarily in connection with the development of a program specifically intended to identify opportunities for further streamlining of processes and improving capabilities, linking strategy with execution, prioritizing resources and enabling a new enterprise resource planning system (fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018).
deferred compensation we recognized an adjustment related to prior periods to correct for previously unrecognized deferred compensation costs associated with certain employment agreements.
transaction, integration and other acquisition-related costs we recognized transaction, integration and other acquisition-related costs in connection with our acquisitions and investments.
loss on contract termination we recognized a loss in connection with the early termination of a beer glass supply contract with owens-illinois, a related-party entity with which we have an equally-owned joint venture which owns and operates a glass production plant located adjacent to our nava brewery.
costs associated with the canadian divestiture and related activities we recognized costs in connection with the evaluation of the merits of executing an initial public offering for a portion of our canadian wine business (fiscal 2017) and net costs incurred in connection with the sale of the canadian wine business (fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017). in addition, in connection with the canadian divestiture, we recognized a trademark impairment loss for trademarks associated with certain u.s. brands within our wine and spirits portfolio sold exclusively through the canadian wine business, for which future sales of these brands were expected to be minimal subsequent to the canadian divestiture (fiscal 2017).
33
other gains (losses)
we recognized gains primarily in connection with the sale of certain non-core assets (fiscal 2019) and the reduction in estimated fair value of a contingent liability associated with a prior period acquisition (fiscal 2018).
gain on sale of business we recognized a net gain on sale of the canadian wine business.
income (loss) from unconsolidated investments we recognized an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value (fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018), and a net gain in connection with the sale of our accolade wine investment (fiscal 2019). for additional information, refer to notes 2, 7 and 10 of the notes to the financial statements.

wine and spirits net sales remained relatively flat as $21.4 million of lower branded wine and spirits volume and $16.2 million of unfavorable product mix shift were largely offset by a $35.5 million favorable impact from pricing. as noted in the table above, the decline in the u.s. shipment volume was not as unfavorable as the decline in u.s. depletion volume. as u.s. shipment volume should generally be aligned with u.s. depletion volume, we expect this timing difference to reverse primarily in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. as a result, first quarter of fiscal 2020 net sales are expected to decrease 10% as compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

the increase in beer is primarily due to $247.2 million of volume growth and the $102.8 million favorable impact from pricing, partially offset by $46.3 million of higher cost of product sold for our mexican beer business. the higher cost of product sold is predominantly due to $57.8 million of increased transportation costs, partially offset by $17.2 million of foreign currency transactional benefits within our mexican beer portfolio. the beer segment also recognized higher operational costs for fiscal 2019, largely attributable to higher depreciation, brewery maintenance and compensation and benefits; however, these costs were offset by brewery sourcing benefits.
the decrease in wine and spirits is largely due to $37.4 million of higher cost of product sold and an unfavorable product mix shift of $26.3 million, partially offset by the $35.5 million favorable impact from pricing. the higher cost of product sold is largely attributable to higher raw material costs, including grape, bulk wine and imported vodka costs, as well as increased transportation costs.
gross profit as a percent of net sales remained flat for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 at 50.3%. this was largely due to the higher cost of product sold within both the beer and wine and spirits segments, which resulted in approximately 25 basis points and 20 basis points of rate decline, respectively, partially offset by the favorable impact from beer pricing in select markets, which contributed approximately 30 basis points of rate growth.

the increase in beer is primarily due to an increase of $63.6 million in marketing spend and $33.7 million in general and administrative expenses. the increase in marketing spend is due largely to planned investment to support the growth of our mexican beer portfolio, including support of the new product introductions. the increase in general and administrative expenses is largely driven by unfavorable foreign currency transaction losses and higher expenses supporting the growth of the business, including compensation and benefits associated primarily with increased headcount and information technology costs.
the decrease in wine and spirits is primarily due to a decrease of $18.2 million in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase of $12.0 million in marketing spend. the decrease in general and administrative expenses is largely driven by certain cost savings initiatives. the increase in marketing spend is primarily attributable to planned investment supporting the portfolio.
the increase in corporate operations and other is due to higher general and administrative expenses driven predominantly by an increase of approximately $28 million in compensation and benefits largely attributable to supporting our growth initiatives.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 20.6% for fiscal 2019 as compared with 20.2% for fiscal 2018. the increase is primarily attributable to the growth in corporate operations and other general and administrative expenses, which resulted in approximately 30 basis points of rate growth.

the increase in beer is primarily attributable to the strong net sales growth, partially offset by the planned increase in marketing spend and the higher cost of product sold. the decrease in wine and spirits was driven by the higher cost of product sold and unfavorable product mix shift, partially offset by pricing. as previously discussed, corporate operations and other reduction in operating income is due largely to the higher costs supporting our growth initiatives.
income from unconsolidated investments income from unconsolidated investments increased to $2,101.6 million for fiscal 2019 from $487.2 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $1,614.4 million. this increase is driven largely by an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value of $1,971.2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared with an unrealized net gain of $464.3 million recognized for fiscal 2018. fiscal 2019 also benefited from a net gain in connection with the sale of our accolade wine investment of $99.8 million.
36
interest expense interest expense increased to $367.1 million for fiscal 2019 from $332.0 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $35.1 million, or 11%. this increase is predominately due to higher average borrowings of approximately $2.0 billion. the higher average borrowings are primarily attributable to the significant purchases of treasury stock for fiscal 2018 and the november 2018 canopy transaction.
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal 2018 consists of a make-whole payment of $73.6 million in connection with the early redemption of our april 2012 senior notes and the write-off of debt issuance costs of $23.4 million in connection with the may and november 2017 repayments of outstanding obligations under the european term a loan facility and the u.s. term a loan facility under our applicable senior credit facility, the july 2017 amendment and restatement of the 2016 credit agreement and the early redemption of our april 2012 senior notes.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 16.5% as compared with 1.0% for fiscal 2018 driven primarily by the recognition of a $351.2 million income tax benefit for fiscal 2018 associated with the enactment of the tcj act, which was signed into law on december 22, 2017. for fiscal 2018, we recognized a provisional net income tax benefit comprised primarily of benefits from (i)  the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower federal statutory rate and (ii)  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities previously provided for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries which were not considered to be indefinitely reinvested; partially offset by the recording of the mandatory one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. we completed our analysis of the income tax implications of the tcj act for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and recognized an additional income tax benefit of $37.6 million resulting from a decrease in the mandatory one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.
for additional information, refer to note 13 of the notes to the financial statements.
we expect our effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 16% to 18%. this includes an estimated impact for (i)  benefits related to the recognition of the income tax effect of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, (ii)   lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses and (iii)  closing of the wine and spirits transaction in accordance with the expected timeline. since estimates are not currently available, this range does not assume (i)  any future changes in the fair value of our canopy investments measured at fair value, (ii)  any gain (loss) recognized in connection with the wine and spirits transaction and (iii)  any equity in earnings (losses) from the canopy equity method investment.
net income attributable to cbi net income attributable to cbi increased to $3,435.9 million for fiscal 2019 from $2,303.4 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $1,132.5 million. this increase is largely attributable to the increase in income from unconsolidated investments discussed above. solid operating performance from beer contributed an additional $202.7 million of operating income. these increases were partially offset by the higher provision for income taxes discussed above.

the decrease in wine and spirits net sales is due to the canadian divestiture of $311.2 million, partially offset by net sales from acquired brands of $50.4 million and organic net sales growth of $86.9 million. the organic growth is due largely to favorable product mix shift of $129.5 million, partially offset by lower branded wine and spirits volume of $39.9 million driven predominantly by brands within our wine and spirits portfolio other than our focus brands.

the decrease in wine and spirits is due to the canadian divestiture of $131.2 million, partially offset by organic gross profit growth of $62.2 million and gross profit from the acquired brands of $26.1 million. the organic growth is due largely to favorable product mix shift of $93.2 million, partially offset by higher branded wine and spirits cost of product sold of $25.9 million.

the increase in beer is primarily due to increases in marketing spend of $46.1 million and general and administrative expenses of $27.9 million. the increase in marketing spend is due largely to planned investment to support the growth of our mexican beer portfolio. the increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly driven by higher expenses supporting the growth of the business. the decrease in wine and spirits is primarily driven by the canadian divestiture of $81.1 million, partially offset by an increase in marketing spend primarily due to planned investment to support our organic growth and acquired businesses of $32.4 million. the increase in corporate operations and other is due to higher general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to increases in consulting of $12.8 million and compensation and benefits of $11.0 million, both largely attributable to supporting the growth of the business.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 20.2% for fiscal 2018 as compared with 19.0% for fiscal 2017. the increase is primarily attributable to the unfavorable change in comparable adjustments and the growth in corporate operations and other general and administrative expenses, which resulted in approximately 135 basis points of rate growth, partially offset by a benefit of approximately 25

operating income growth in our beer segment was driven predominantly by the factors discussed above. wine and spirits remained relatively flat as the loss of operating income in connection with the divestiture of the canadian wine business was offset by the growth factors discussed above.
income from unconsolidated investments income from unconsolidated investments increased to $487.2 million for fiscal 2018 from $27.3 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $459.9 million. this increase is driven largely by an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value of $464.3 million.
interest expense interest expense remained relatively flat for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 as a lower average interest rate of approximately 30 basis points was offset by higher average borrowings of approximately $645 million. the lower average interest rate is predominantly due to the issuance of the lower rate december 2016 senior notes, may 2017 senior notes and november 2017 senior notes and the repayment of the higher rate august 2006 senior notes and january 2008 senior notes. the higher average borrowings are primarily attributable to the purchases of businesses and treasury stock, net of proceeds from the canadian divestiture, during fiscal 2017.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 1.0% as compared with 26.4% for fiscal 2017 driven primarily by the recognition of a $351.2 million income tax benefit for fiscal 2018 associated with the enactment of the tcj act, which was signed into law on december 22, 2017. for fiscal 2018, we recognized a provisional net income tax benefit comprised primarily of benefits from (i)  the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower federal statutory rate and (ii)  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities previously provided for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries which were not considered to be indefinitely reinvested; partially offset by the recording of the mandatory one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017 was also favorably impacted by:
•   lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses;
•   the recognition of the income tax effect of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled in connection with our march 1, 2017, adoption of fasb amended share-based compensation guidance; and
•   the new, lower federal statutory rate of 32.7% associated with the tcj act, as compared to the federal statutory rate of 35% in effect for fiscal 2017.

net income attributable to cbi net income attributable to cbi increased to $2,303.4 million for fiscal 2018 from $1,528.6 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $774.8 million. this increase was driven largely by the factors discussed above, including the net unrealized gain from the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value of $464.3 million, the net income tax benefit of $351.2 million resulting from the tcj act and the strong operating performance for the beer segment of $307.8 million.
financial liquidity and capital resources general our ability to consistently generate cash flow from operating activities is one of our most significant financial strengths. our strong cash flows enable us to invest in our people and our brands, make appropriate capital investments, provide a quarterly cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock and make strategic investments and acquisitions that we believe will enhance shareholder value. our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. our principal use of cash in our operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. historically, we have used cash flow from operating activities to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. additionally, we have a commercial paper program which we use to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. we will continue to use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures.
we have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.
in november 2018, we completed the november 2018 canopy transaction for c$5,078.7 million, or $3,869.9 million. in addition, we incurred $24.5 million of direct acquisition costs. the aggregate cash paid at closing was financed with (i)  the net proceeds from the issuance of $2,150.0 million aggregate principal amount of october 2018 senior notes, (ii)  $1,500.0 million in term loans under the term credit agreement and (iii)  the remainder from proceeds of borrowings under our commercial paper program. based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow from operating activities, we expect to be able to return to our targeted leverage ratio within 24 months following the close of this transaction, while continuing to make appropriate investments in our business that we believe will enhance shareholder value.
in april 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business for approximately $1.7 billion, subject to closing adjustments. we expect to use the net cash proceeds from this transaction primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings.

operating activities fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 is largely due to strong cash flow from the beer segment driven primarily by the segment's solid operating results, including a benefit from decreased inventory levels due to strong shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. additionally, net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 benefited from lower income tax payments predominantly due to (i)  the receipt of a federal tax refund for fiscal 2019 and (ii)  lower federal tax payments resulting from the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate associated with the enactment of the tcj act.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 is primarily due to strong cash flow from the beer segment driven largely by the segment's strong operating results, partially offset by (i)  the timing of collections for recoverable value-added taxes and (ii)  an increase in cash outflow from accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments. net cash provided by operating activities also benefited from our march 1, 2017, adoption of the fasb amended share-based compensation guidance, which resulted in the classification of excess tax benefits (resulting from an increase in the fair value of an award from grant date to the vesting or settlement date) as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows instead of as a financing activity where they were previously presented prior to march 1, 2017.
investing activities fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
the increase in net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the november 2018 canopy transaction. the increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by (i)  lower capital expenditures of $171.3 million, (ii)  proceeds from the may 2018 sale of our accolade wine investment of $110.2 million and (iii)  the lower level of business acquisition activity of $104.5 million.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 is primarily due to the lower level of net business acquisition and divestiture activity of $380.6 million. the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by the november 2017 canopy investment of $191.3 million and higher capital expenditures of $150.2 million.
business acquisitions consist primarily of the following:
fiscal 2019                  fiscal 2018                      fiscal 2017
● four corners (july 2018)   ● schrader cellars (june 2017)   ● prisoner (april 2016)

debt total debt outstanding as of february 28, 2019, amounted to $13,616.5 million, an increase of $3,429.8 million from february 28, 2018. this increase was predominately due to the financing of the november 2018 canopy transaction, including the issuance of the october 2018 senior notes and borrowings under the term credit agreement, partially offset by the conversion of $248.2 million from long-term debt to noncontrolling equity interests associated with the noncash settlement of a prior contractual agreement with our glass production plant joint venture partner.

additionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of commercial paper. our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 credit agreement. accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 credit agreement.
we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. if the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 credit agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. we do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 credit agreement.
we had the following borrowing capacity available under our 2018 credit agreement:

the financial institutions participating in our 2018 credit agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe such financial institutions will comply with any future funding requests. however, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.
we and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2018 credit agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness) by subsidiaries that are not guarantors, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and thresholds. the financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio, both as defined in the 2018 credit agreement. as of february 28, 2019, under the 2018 credit agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 5.25x.
the obligations under the term credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our u.s. subsidiaries. in addition, the representations, warranties, covenants and events of default set forth in the term credit agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in the 2018 credit agreement.
our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to:  (i)  a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii)  a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (iii)  restrictions on mergers, consolidations and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.
as of february 28, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the 2018 credit agreement, the term credit agreement and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.

common stock dividends on april 3, 2019, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share of class a common stock, $0.68 per share of class b convertible common stock and $0.68 per share of class 1 common stock payable on may 24, 2019, to stockholders of record of each class on may 10, 2019. we expect to return approximately $567 million to stockholders in fiscal 2020 through cash dividends.
we currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our board of directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors, including those set forth under item 1a "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k.
share repurchase program our board of directors have authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of our class a common stock and class b convertible common stock under the 2018 authorization. shares repurchased under this authorization have become treasury shares.
as of february 28, 2019, total shares repurchased under this authorization are as follows:

(1)   interest rates on long-term debt obligations range from 2.0% to 5.3% as of february 28, 2019. interest payments on long-term debt do not include interest related to capital lease obligations, which represent approximately 0.2% of our total long-term debt, as amounts are not material.
(2)   includes $36.3 million associated with expected payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as of february 28, 2019, $0.3 million of which is expected to be paid in the less than one year period. the payments are reflected in the period in which we believe they will ultimately be settled based on our experience in these matters. other long-term liabilities do not include payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $188.0 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. in addition, other long-term liabilities do not include expected payments for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as amounts are not material. for a detailed discussion of these items, refer to note 13 of the notes to the financial statements.
(3)   consists primarily of $5,955.1 million for contracts to purchase certain raw materials and supplies over the next sixteen fiscal years and $649.8 million for contracts to purchase equipment and services over the next three fiscal years. for a detailed discussion of our purchase obligations, refer to note 15 of the notes to the financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
capital expenditures during fiscal 2019, we incurred $886.3 million for capital expenditures, including $720.0 million for the beer segment primarily for (i)  our nava brewery and glass production plant expansions, (ii)  our obregon brewery optimization and expansion and (iii)  our mexicali brewery construction (collectively, the "mexico beer expansion projects"). management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs. we plan to spend from $800.0 million to $900.0 million for capital expenditures for fiscal 2020, including approximately $750.0 million for the beer segment associated primarily with the mexico beer expansion projects. the remaining fiscal 2020 capital expenditures consist of improvements of existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings. the mexico beer expansion projects are expected to be completed over the next four fiscal years.
effects of inflation and changing prices our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. we intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices, subject to normal competitive conditions. there can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. in addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives.
critical accounting estimates and policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements. however, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. in applying those policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. those estimates are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. on an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business. our critical accounting estimates include:
•   goodwill and other intangible assets. we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories: (i) intangible assets with definite lives subject to
46
amortization, (ii)  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (iii)  goodwill. for intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. we perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist. the guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing a quantitative impairment test. under the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method supplemented by the market approach. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, a goodwill impairment will be recognized. the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. our reporting units with goodwill include the beer segment and the wine and spirits segment. in estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors. the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. these assumptions reflect management's estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. the recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the qualitative assessment. our decision to utilize the qualitative assessment was based primarily on the significant amount of excess fair value over the carrying amount of goodwill for our reporting units noted in the prior year assessment.  as part of the qualitative assessment, we first identified the key drivers of fair value used in the prior year valuations for each of the reporting units noting that the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations were: (i)  the discount rate, (ii)  the expected long-term growth rate and (iii)  the annual cash flow projections. we then evaluated whether those drivers had subsequently been affected by events and circumstances that could have positive, negative or neutral impacts on the valuation inputs. no indication of impairment was noted for either of our reporting units; therefore, no quantitative assessment was performed. for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.
we performed sensitivity analyses on our qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, by updating the reporting unit's carrying value for all assets and liabilities, as well as prior year's estimated fair value, using actual reporting unit operating results for fiscal 2019, with any forecast versus actual variances carried through estimated future periods. these analyses further supported our qualitative conclusion of no indication of impairment for either of our reporting units.
our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. the trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. the guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. under the quantitative assessment, our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. the
47
estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark. if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark, then an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value. in estimating the fair value of the trademarks, management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors. the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. these assumptions reflect management's estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. the recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we performed our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis utilizing the qualitative assessment for our import beer, total wine and total spirits trademark assets and the quantitative assessment for the ballast point and funky buddha trademark assets. our decision to utilize the qualitative assessment for the import beer, total wine and total spirits trademark assets was based primarily on the significant amount of excess fair value over the carrying amount for the trademark assets noted in the prior year assessment. no indication of impairment was noted for any of the trademark assets tested under the qualitative assessment. as the aforementioned more likely than not criteria was not met, no quantitative assessment was performed. additionally, under the quantitative assessment, no indication of impairment was noted for the funky buddha trademark asset.
for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the beer segment's ballast point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $108.0 million in connection with certain continuing negative trends within its craft beer portfolio and a change in strategy for this portfolio focused on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets. in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the beer segment's ballast point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $86.8 million in connection with certain negative trends within its craft beer portfolio. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the wine and spirits' u.s. business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $37.6 million in connection with our decision to discontinue certain small-scale, low-margin u.s. brands. additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the wine and spirits' u.s. business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $8.4 million in connection with certain u.s. brands sold exclusively through the canadian wine business, for which we expect future sales of these brands to be minimal subsequent to the canadian divestiture (refer to note 7 of the notes to the financial statements for further discussion).
the most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are:  (i)  the estimated royalty rate, (ii)  the discount rate, (iii)  the expected long-term growth rate and (iv)  the annual revenue projections. as of january 1, 2019, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of the funky buddha trademark, then each change individually would not have resulted in its carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.
•   accounting for income taxes. we estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning strategies. we are subject to income taxes in canada, luxembourg, mexico, switzerland, the u.s. and other jurisdictions. we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, is audited and finally resolved.
48
we believe that all tax positions are fully supported. however, we recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the fasb guidance for income tax accounting. accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. we measure and recognize the tax benefit from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. in addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. if necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. the realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets will be reflected in our effective tax rate in the period in which they are determined.
accounting guidance accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2019 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. for additional information on recently adopted accounting guidance and accounting guidance not yet adopted, refer to note 1 in the notes to the financial statements.

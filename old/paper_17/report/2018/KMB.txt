item 1a.    risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us.
2     kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation or other necessary supplies or services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results.
increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, supplier consolidation which could limit our sources of supply for these items, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in past years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. in some instances, we utilize negotiated short-term contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility, but we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks.
a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products and disposable wipes, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials.
our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources.
there can be no assurance that our efforts to increase selling prices, such as our recently announced plans to increase net selling prices across a majority of our north america consumer products businesses, will be successful.
increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business.
our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and e-tailers. with the consolidation of retail trade, both traditional retailers and e-tailers, we are increasingly dependent on key customers, and some of these customers, including large-format retailers and large e-tailers, may have significant bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
intense competition for sales of our products, changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, a growing e-commerce marketplace, customers' and competitors' actions. our competitors for these markets include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers. some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. e-commerce potentially intensifies competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, which could adversely affect our financial results.
3     kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products. demand for our products may change based on many factors, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products and mid to lower-tier value products, low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, negative consumer response to pricing actions, consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to e-tailers, or other changes in consumer trends or habits. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease.
our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. also, if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights, we may be less competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition.
there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.
we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist. in january 2018, we announced a global restructuring program. the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees, suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results.
our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results.
our strategy includes operations growth outside the u.s., especially in developing markets such as china, eastern europe, asean and latin america. about half of our net sales come from markets outside the u.s. we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 35 countries, and sell products in more than 175 countries. our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks:
•   exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts where available and economically advantageous. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations.
•   increases in currency exchange restrictions. these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. or obtain currency exchange for u.s. dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries.
•   adverse political conditions. risks related to political instability, expropriation, new or revised legal or regulatory constraints, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences, including consequences from brexit, could adversely affect our financial results.
•   increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations.
the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") and item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of highly inflationary accounting in argentina.
4     kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report government regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
as a global company, we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-bribery or anti-corruption, product liability, environmental, intellectual property or other matters, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions.
if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures, and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image.
in addition, new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business, including the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union, which could adversely impact our financial results. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance, or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs, excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials.
if our information technology systems suffer interruptions, failures or breaches, our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage.
our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business. these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.
increased cyber-security threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations regarding the handling of personal data, such as the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") which was recently adopted by the european union. any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, supplier, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. any such event, or any failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr or other laws in this area, could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in legal liability, or regulatory or other penalties. in addition, we may incur large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events.
disruption in our supply chain or the failure of third-party providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations.
our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address.
in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our suppliers, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.
5     kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business.
developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, or breaches of consumer, customer, supplier, employee or other confidential information, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity, potentially with negative perception of our products or brands. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination, or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.
new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies, including tax reform in the u.s. that was enacted in december 2017. other jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
we may divest or acquire product lines or businesses, which could impact our results.
we may periodically divest product lines or businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses. furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products.
we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future, or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.
the inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures and acquisitions with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this md&a is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and prospects. this discussion and analysis compares 2018 results to 2017, and 2017 results to 2016. the reference to "n.m." indicates that the calculation is not meaningful. in addition, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix and net selling prices on net sales. changes in foreign currency rates and acquisitions and divestitures also impact the year-over-year change in net sales. dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.
the following will be discussed and analyzed:
•   overview of business
•   overview of 2018 results
•   results of operations and related information
•   unaudited quarterly data
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   critical accounting policies and use of estimates
•   legal matters
•   new accounting standards
•   business outlook
•   information concerning forward-looking statements certain prior period financial information related to our adoption of accounting standards update no. 2017-07, compensation-retirement benefits (topic 715), improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost ("asu no. 2017-07") and the classification of costs associated with sales of k-c professional ("kcp") dispensers has been recast. the recast has no impact on our earnings or earnings per share in any period. see item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
throughout this md&a, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., or gaap, and are therefore referred to as non-gaap financial measures. these measures include adjusted gross and operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted other (income) and expense, net, and adjusted effective tax rate. we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management.
non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable gaap measures, and they should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.  there are limitations to these non-gaap financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded.  we compensate for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as a supplement to the gaap measures and by providing reconciliations of the non-gaap and comparable gaap financial measures.
the non-gaap financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this md&a:
•   2018 global restructuring program - in 2018, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. see item 8, note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•   u.s. tax reform related matters - in 2018 and 2017, we recognized a net charge and a net benefit, respectively, associated with u.s. tax reform related matters. see item 8, note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
11      kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report
•   2014 organization restructuring - in 2014, we initiated a restructuring in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the 2014 spin-off of our health care business. as a result, we recognized restructuring charges in 2014, 2015 and 2016. restructuring actions were completed by december 31, 2016. see item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•   adjustment related to venezuelan operations - results in 2016 include other income related to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations. see item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
overview of business we are a global company focused on leading the world in essentials for a better life, with manufacturing facilities in 33 countries and products sold in more than 175 countries. our products are sold under well-known brands such as kleenex, scott, huggies, pull-ups, kotex and depend. we have three reportable business segments: personal care, consumer tissue and kcp. these business segments are described in greater detail in item 8, note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
in operating our business, we seek to:
•   grow our portfolio of brands through innovation, category development and commercial execution,
•   leverage our cost and financial discipline to fund growth and improve margins, and
•   allocate capital in value-creating ways.
we describe our business outside north america in two groups - developing and emerging markets ("d&e") and developed markets. d&e markets comprise eastern europe, the middle east and africa, latin america and asia-pacific, excluding australia and south korea. developed markets consist of western and central europe, australia and south korea.
highlights for 2018 include the following:
•   net sales of $18.5 billion increased 1 percent compared to 2017. organic sales growth of more than 1 percent was partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
•   in north america, organic sales increased 3 percent in k-c professional and 1 percent in consumer products.
•   outside north america, organic sales increased 2 percent in d&amp;e markets and 1 percent in developed markets.
•   input cost inflation of $795 was partially offset by $375 in cost savings from our force (focused on reducing costs everywhere) program and $135 in cost savings from the 2018 global restructuring program.
•   diluted earnings per share were $4.03 in 2018 compared to $6.40 in 2017, including charges from the 2018 global restructuring program and u.s. tax reform related matters in 2018 and a net benefit from u.s. tax reform related matters in 2017.
•   we continue to focus on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders. cash provided by operations was $3.0 billion in 2018. we raised our dividend in 2018 by 3.1 percent, the 46th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. altogether, share repurchases and dividends in 2018 amounted to $2.2 billion.
we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which can affect our business operations and financial results. see item 1a, "risk factors" in this form 10-k for additional information.

2018 global restructuring program in january 2018, we announced a new global restructuring program. the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying the company's manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. the program will make our overhead organization structure and manufacturing supply chain less complex and more efficient. we expect to close or sell approximately 10 manufacturing facilities and expand production capacity at several others. we expect to exit or divest some lower-margin businesses that generate approximately 1 percent of our net sales. the sales are concentrated in our consumer tissue business segment. the restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies. workforce reductions are expected to be in the range of 5,000 to 5,500. certain capital appropriations under the 2018 global restructuring program are being finalized. accounting for actions related to each appropriation will commence when the appropriation is authorized for execution.
the restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2020, with total costs anticipated to be $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion pre-tax ($1.35 billion to $1.5 billion after tax). cash costs are expected to be $900 to $1.0 billion, primarily related to workforce reductions.  non-cash charges are primarily related to incremental depreciation, asset write-offs and pension settlement and curtailment charges. annual pre-tax savings from the restructuring are expected to be $500 to $550 by 2021. in addition, to implement this program, we expect to incur incremental capital spending of approximately $600 to $700 by the end of 2020. restructuring charges in 2019 are expected to be $600 to $750 pre-tax ($470 to $570 after tax).
we generated savings of $135 in 2018 and expect to generate savings of $100 to $125 in 2019.

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations cash provided by operations was $3.0 billion in 2018 compared to $2.9 billion in 2017. the increase was driven by improved working capital and lower tax payments, mostly offset by lower earnings, payments related to the 2018 global restructuring program and higher pension contributions. cash provided by operations was $3.2 billion in 2016. the decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by higher tax payments.

•   the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily superabsorbent materials, pulp and utilities. although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.
•   the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts for goods and services we have negotiated for delivery.
the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain. the following payments are not included in the table:
•   we will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately $25 to these plans in 2019.
•   other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately $60 through 2028.
•   accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests.
investing our capital spending was $0.9 billion in 2018 and $0.8 billion 2017. we expect capital spending to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2019, including incremental spending associated with the 2018 global restructuring program.
financing we issue long-term debt in the public market periodically. proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness. see item 8, note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
our short-term debt, which consists of u.s. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-u.s. subsidiaries, was $495 as of december 31, 2018 (included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet). the average month-end balance of short-term debt for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $583 and for the twelve months ended december 31, 2018 was $831. these short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations. the level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions, dividends and income taxes.
at december 31, 2018, total debt was $7.5 billion compared to $7.4 billion at december 31, 2017.
in june 2018, we entered into a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in june 2023 and a $500 revolving credit facility which expires in june 2019. these facilities, currently unused, replaced a similar $2.0 billion facility, support our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason.
we paid $1.4 billion in dividends in 2018. the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 3 percent for 2019. we repurchase shares of kimberly-clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs.
20      kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report during 2018, we repurchased 7.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $800 through a broker in the open market. we are targeting full-year 2019 share repurchases between $600 and $900, subject to market conditions.
our subsidiaries in argentina ("k-c argentina") began accounting for their operations as highly inflationary effective july 1, 2018, as required by gaap.  under highly inflationary accounting, k-c argentina's functional currency became the u.s. dollar, and its income statement and balance sheet have been measured in u.s. dollars using both current and historical rates of exchange.  the effect of changes in exchange rates on peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities has been reflected in earnings in other (income) and expense, net and was not material.  as of december 31, 2018, k-c argentina had a small net peso monetary position.  net sales of k-c argentina were less than 2 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future. further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the u.s. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments. these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
sales incentives and trade promotion allowances trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales. promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs. generally, the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories, and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized. our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies for these programs did not materially change with the adoption, on january 1, 2018, of the accounting standard update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers.
employee postretirement benefits substantially all regular employees in the u.s. and the united kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain u.s. and united kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit (the "principal plans"). certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8, note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations:
•   long-term rate of return on plan assets. the expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. in setting these assumptions, we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the target asset allocation. actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate.
as of december 31, 2018, the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $1.5 billion. these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, and whether such
21      kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the "corridor" as required. if the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2019.
•   discount rate. the discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future u.s. pension obligation at december 31, 2018 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan. for the united kingdom plan, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities. each year's expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations. if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2019, and the december 31, 2018 pension liability would increase by about $115.
•   other assumptions. there are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations, primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections.
pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $90 in 2019, including incremental charges resulting from 2018 global restructuring program actions. pension expense beyond 2019 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans.
substantially all u.s. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate:
•   discount rate. the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above, and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that country's pension obligation. if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the impact to 2019 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the december 31, 2018 benefit liability would not be material.
•   health care cost trend rate. the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace.
deferred income taxes and potential assessments as a global organization, we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results, particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the u.s. and uncertain tax positions. our income tax related accounting policies, account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8, note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
•   deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. we have recorded deferred tax assets related to, among other matters, income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. these carryforwards are primarily in non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the u.s. foreign tax credits earned in the u.s. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
•   undistributed earnings. as of december 31, 2018, we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $8.4 billion. earnings of $5.6 billion were previously subject to tax, primarily due to the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings required by the tax act. any additional taxes due with respect to such previously-taxed earnings, if repatriated, would generally be limited to foreign and u.s. state income taxes. deferred taxes have been recorded for foreign and u.s. state income taxes on $0.7 billion of earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated. we do not intend to distribute the remaining $4.9 billion of previously-taxed
22      kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and u.s. state income taxes on such earnings.  while the transition tax resulted in a reduction of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, any remaining amount of financial reporting over tax basis after such reduction could be subject to additional taxes, if repatriated.  however, we consider any excess to be indefinitely reinvested.  at this time, the determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the $4.9 billion of previously-taxed foreign earnings is not practicable.
•   uncertain tax positions. we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate. where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations.

business outlook in 2019, we plan to focus on our strategies for long-term success, including growing our brands, leveraging our financial discipline and allocating capital in value-creating ways.  in 2019, we expect earnings per share to be $4.85 to $5.35. adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $6.50 to $6.70, which excludes 2018 global restructuring program charges equivalent to $1.35 to $1.65. our adjusted earnings per share guidance is based on the assumptions described below:
•   we expect net sales to decrease 1 to 2 percent. we anticipate changes in foreign currency exchange rates to have an unfavorable impact of 3 to 4 percent. exited businesses in conjunction with the 2018 global restructuring program are expected to reduce sales slightly, mostly in k-c professional.
•   we expect organic sales to increase approximately 2 percent, driven by higher net selling prices of at least 3 percent.
•   we expect adjusted operating profit growth of 1 to 4 percent.
•   we plan to achieve cost savings of $400 to $450, including $300 to $325 from our force program and $100 to $125 from the 2018 global restructuring program.
•   we expect inflation in key cost inputs of $300 to $400. we anticipate the majority of the inflation to occur in international markets.
•   we expect foreign currency translation effects to reduce operating profit by 2 to 3 percent and transaction effects to also negatively impact the comparison.
•   we expect interest expense to increase somewhat year-on-year.
•   we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 23 to 25 percent compared to 21 percent in 2018. at the mid-point, the higher rate is equivalent to an approximate 3 1⁄2 percent reduction in adjusted earnings per share.
•   we expect net income from equity companies to be similar year-on-year.
information concerning forward-looking statements certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook, including the anticipated cost savings from our force program, costs and savings from the 2018 global restructuring program, cash flow and uses of cash, growth initiatives, innovations, marketing and other spending, net sales, anticipated currency rates and exchange risks, including the impact in argentina, raw material, energy and other input costs, effective tax rate, contingencies and anticipated transactions of kimberly-clark, including dividends, share repurchases and pension contributions, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting kimberly-clark.  there can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be
23      kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report as estimated.  forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them.
the assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. in addition, many factors outside our control, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the prices and availability of our raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products, energy costs, our ability to maintain key customer relationships and retail trade customer actions, as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business, could affect the realization of these estimates.
the factors described under item 1a, "risk factors" in this form 10-k, or in our other sec filings, among others, could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.

item 1a. risk factors statements in this annual report on form 10-k and elsewhere that are forward-looking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the company's actual results of operations. certain of these risks and uncertainties, which have affected and, in the future, could affect the company's actual results are discussed below. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements made due to new information or future events. investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements.
the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the company's business and any forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and elsewhere. see the section entitled "forward-looking statements" set forth above. any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10-k or the company's other sec filings could materially adversely affect the company's business, operating results and financial condition.
it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for revenue growth in light of competitive challenges.
we face significant competition across many of our product lines. competitors include companies ranging from start-up companies, which may be able to more quickly respond to customers' needs, to large multinational companies, which may have greater financial, marketing, operational, and research and development resources than the company. in addition, consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company. moreover, customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors, and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses. the entry into the market by manufacturers in china, india and other low-cost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures, particularly in developing markets. failure to anticipate and respond to competitors' actions may impact the company's future sales and earnings.
to address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to maintain and improve our revenue growth, including:
•   strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets;

•   allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;

•   developing new applications for our technologies;

•   continuing key opinion leader initiatives;

•   finding new markets for our products;

•   acquiring new products and business in growing or novel markets; and

•   continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.
our acquisition growth strategy poses financial, management and other risks and challenges.
we routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets, and have completed fifteen acquisitions and several investments in the last six years. however, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including competition among buyers, the high valuations of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and other approvals, and availability of capital. there can be no assurance that we will engage in any additional acquisitions or that we will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits. in addition, acquisitions financed with borrowings could make us more vulnerable to business downturns and could negatively affect our earnings due to higher leverage and interest expense.
10
our inability to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. when we do identify and consummate acquisitions, we may face financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention, difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, integration of different corporate cultures, increased expenses, assumption of unknown liabilities, indemnities, potential disputes with the sellers, and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities. further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets, or other investments become impaired.
we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity, for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results (affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment) and declines in the financial condition of our business. we may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired. any such charge would adversely impact our financial results.
in addition, the company's expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the company's business. these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected. for example, the company has an approximate 8% equity investment in publicly traded chemocentryx, inc. (nasdaq: ccxi) that is valued at $54.3 million as of june 30, 2018. the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated, the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares. in fiscal 2017, we also invested and held a minority interest in privately-held astute medical, inc. (astute), a diagnostics company developing new diagnostics tests relating to kidney injury. in fiscal 2018, astute was acquired by a third party and we realized a loss $16.2 million on our investment.
significant developments stemming from the u.s. administration or the u.k.'s referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on us.
the u.s. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements, such as the north american free trade agreement (nafta), and has imposed significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the united states, particularly from china. the administration has also indicated an intention to ask congress to make significant changes, replacement or elimination of the patient protection and affordable care act, and government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government programs. changes in u.s. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.
additionally, in a referendum vote held on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom (uk) voted to leave the european union (eu). subsequently, on march 29, 2017, the uk invoked article 50 of the lisbon treaty to formally begin the withdrawal process. the impact of this action has caused and may continue to cause global economic uncertainty and currency exchange rate fluctuations. although it is unknown what the terms of the uk's future relationship with the eu will be, it is possible that there will be disruption to the uk and eu economies, as well as greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and the eu and increased regulatory and tax complexities. any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our business and financial results, particularly since our european headquarters and shipping facilities are currently located in the uk. additionally, attracting and retaining qualified employees who are citizens of eu countries to our uk facilities may be more difficult given the uncertainties resulting from the uk withdrawal.
11
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. we develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. for example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. changes in the u.s. food and drug administration's regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.
we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities in the u.s. and elsewhere and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.
we are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the u.s. federal drug administration (the fda), the u.s. drug enforcement agency (the dea), the u.s. department of health and human services (the dhhs), and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. in particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety. our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of, the dea, the fda, the dhhs, foreign agencies and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. the manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda, the dea, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-u.s. regulatory authorities. in addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities. failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. in addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant. we are the sole manufacturer of a number of products for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers.
we are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the u.s. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
12
we are subject to financial, operating, legal and compliance risk associated with global operations.
we engage in business globally, with approximately 46% of our sales revenue in fiscal 2018 coming from outside the u.s. in addition, one of our strategies is to expand geographically, particularly in china, india and in developing countries, both through distribution and through direct operations. this subjects us to a number of risks, including international economic, political, and labor conditions; currency fluctuations; tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries); increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately; inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology; tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; transportation delays; operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters, climate change and diseases.
the application of laws and regulations implicating global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict. compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions, prohibited business conduct, and damage to our reputation. we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the u.s.
we continue to expand our operations in countries with developing economies, where it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by u.s. regulations applicable to the company, such as the foreign corrupt practices act. although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain aspects of our business operations, including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such u.s. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies. any such non-compliance, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or penalties.
changes in economic conditions could negatively impact our revenues and earnings.
our biotechnology and protein platforms products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions. research and development spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. our diagnostics segment products are intended primarily for the medical diagnostics market, which relies largely on government healthcare-related policies and funding. changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact us directly or our customers and, correspondingly, our sales to them. several years ago, the u.s. and global economies experienced a period of economic downturn and have been slow to recover in some parts of the world. such downturns, and other reductions or delays in governmental funding, could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products. we carry essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings.
13
over the past two years we identified and remediated material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which, if recurring, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the securities exchange act. at the beginning of fiscal 2017 management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. as a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in internal control-an integrated framework (2013 framework) for the years ended june 30, 2016 and 2017. in fiscal 2018 we completed a remediation plan that addressed these material weaknesses. as we continue to grow and acquire additional business, we may fail to implement effective internal controls for our recently acquired operations that result in additional material weaknesses, and harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common shares.
our success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel and creating a new culture that includes the employees joining through acquisition.
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, production, sales and marketing, and management personnel are critical to our success. our anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel. we also operate in several geographic locations where competition for talent is strong, making employee retention particularly challenging in those locations. for example, some of our fastest growing businesses are located in northern california and eastern massachusetts, both of which currently are experiencing low unemployment and a competitive environment for finding and retaining talent. our growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees. as we integrate past and future acquisitions and evolve our corporate culture to incorporate the new workforces, some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing. the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business.
cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines, or lawsuits.
the integrity and protection of our own data, and that of our customers and employees, is critical to our business. the regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products and services to customers. although our computer and communications hardware are protected through physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins, software viruses, and similar events. these events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. the techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. as a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. if our computer systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customers could curtail or cease using its applications, and we could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm our business.
we are dependent on maintaining our intellectual property rights.
our success depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain our intellectual property, including trade secrets. if we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, we may lose our technological or competitive advantage, or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. we attempt to protect trade secrets in part through confidentiality agreements, but those agreements can be breached, and if they are, there may not be an adequate remedy. if trade secrets become publicly known, we could lose our competitive position.
14
we also attempt to protect and maintain intellectual property through the patent process. as of june 30, 2018, we owned or exclusively licensed 152 granted u.s. patents and approximately 82 pending patent applications. we cannot be confident that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents, and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted. it is possible that, if patents are granted to us, others will design around our patented technologies. further, other parties may challenge any patents granted to us and courts or regulatory agencies may hold our patents to be invalid or unenforceable. we may not be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents. our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties. to the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. if our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors' products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business. both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive.
we may be involved in disputes to determine the scope, coverage and validity of others' proprietary rights, or to defend against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, any of which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely impact our business.
our success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate. we have obtained and continue to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others. since we have not conducted a patent infringement study for each of our products, it is possible that some of our products may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties.
we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. these lawsuits are expensive, take significant time, and divert management's focus from other business concerns. if we are found to be infringing the intellectual property of others, we could be required to cease certain activities, alter our products or processes or pay licensing fees. this could cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on us. if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms, or unable to design around any third party patent, we may be unable to sell some of our products and services, which could result in reduced revenue. in addition, if we do not prevail, a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits, which may adversely affect our earnings.
the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce, package and distribute its products which, if disrupted, could materially impair our business operations.
the company's internal quality control, packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the company's sales. since certain company products must comply with food and drug administration quality system regulations and because in all instances, the company creates value for its customers through the development of high-quality products, any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason, particularly at the minneapolis facility, could adversely affect sales and customer relationships, and therefore adversely affect the business. while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks, and while insurance coverage may reimburse, in whole or in part, for losses related to such disruptions, the company's future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions.
our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites.
we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale. any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business. we have significant operations in california, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
15
fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
as a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. in particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states, including tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") signed by the president of the united states on december 22, 2017, which includes broad and complex changes to the united states tax code and the state tax response to the tax act.  reasonable estimates were used in determining several of the components of the impact of the tax act, including our fiscal 2018 deferred income tax activity and the amount of post-1986 foreign deferred earnings subject to the repatriation toll charge.  in addition, certain provisions of the tax act including the base erosion anti-abuse tax (beat) and the provision designed to tax currently global intangible low-tax income (gilti) are effective for the company in the year beginning july 1, 2018.   we are still analyzing certain aspects of the tax act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of our deferred tax balances and the amount of the repatriation toll charge liability, and ultimately cause us to revise our initial estimates in future periods. in addition, changes in interpretations, assumptions and guidance regarding the tax act, as well as the potential for technical corrections, could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods.
in preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.
we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as fedex in the u.s. and dhl in europe. if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. in addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.
as a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. as a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the "functional currency"). movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. as our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. in fiscal 2018, currency translation had a favorable effect of $12.7 million on revenues due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services.
we have entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility. the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect us, make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions, and prevent us from funding our expansion strategy.
in connection with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics on august 1, 2018, we used a new credit facility governed by a credit agreement entered into on july 28, 2018. the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $600 million, which can be increased by an additional $200 million subject to certain conditions, and a term loan of $250 million. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate. as of august 24, 2018, the company had drawn $330 million under the credit agreement.
the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us, such as:
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, expansion strategy, or other needs;

•   increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility in planning for, adverse changes in economic, industry and competitive conditions; and

•   increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates.

16
the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. these covenants limit our ability to, among other things, sell, lease or transfer any properties or assets, with certain exceptions; and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions, with certain exceptions.
a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. in addition, the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement, such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends.
our share price will fluctuate.
over the last several years, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility. both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. in addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:
•   operating results that vary from our financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors;

•   the financial performance of the major end markets that we target;

•   the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;

•   announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors; and

•   changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets.

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.
for the past 10 years, our board has consistently declared quarterly dividends of $0.25 to $0.32 cents per share. in the future, our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. we provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and segment level. we also provide quantitative information about discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. the md&a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information and related notes included in this form 10-k. this discussion contains various "non-gaap financial measures" and also contains various "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. we refer readers to the statements entitled "non-gaap financial measures" located at the end of this md&a and "forward-looking information and cautionary statements" and "risk factors" within items 1 and 1a of this form 10-k.
overview bio-techne develops, manufactures and sells biotechnology products and clinical diagnostic controls worldwide. with our deep product portfolio and application expertise, bio-techne is a leader in providing specialized proteins, including cytokines and growth factors, and related immunoassays, small molecules and other reagents to the research, diagnostics and clinical controls markets.
bio-techne operates worldwide with three reportable business segments, biotechnology, protein platforms, and diagnostics, all of which service the life science and diagnostics markets. the biotechnology reporting segment provides consumables used for conducting laboratory experiments by both industry and academic scientists within the biotechnology and biomedical life science fields including proteins, antibodies, immunoassays, flow cytometry products, intracellular signaling products, and biologically active chemical compounds. the protein platforms reporting segment develops and commercializes proprietary systems and consumables for protein analysis. the diagnostics reporting segment reporting segment provides a range of controls and calibrators used with diagnostic equipment and as proficiency testing tools, as well as other reagents incorporated into diagnostic kits.
overall results for fiscal 2018, consolidated net sales increased 14% as compared to fiscal 2017. after adjusting for the impacts of the trevigen, atlanta biologicals and eurocell acquisitions in fiscal 2018, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, organic sales for the year increased 9% with currency translation contributing 2% and acquisitions contributing 3%. the organic growth was broad-based as the company achieved high-single digit growth in the us with contributions from both the academic and bio-pharma end-markets. europe sales grew in the mid-teens with growth in both the academic and bio-pharma end-markets. china sales grew nearly 25% and japan sales grew in the mid-teens while the rest of the asia-pacific region grew in the high-teens.
consolidated gaap net earnings increased 65% for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. after adjusting for acquisition related costs, stock-based compensation, and certain income tax items in both years, adjusted net earnings increased 24% in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. adjusted earnings growth was driven by strong volume leverage and the benefit from tax reform, which was partially offset by negative business mix, lower margin acquisitions, and investments in global commercial resources and administrative infrastructure.
for fiscal 2017, consolidated net sales increased 13% as compared to fiscal 2016. after adjusting for the impacts of the space and advanced cell diagnostics (acd) acquisitions in fiscal 2017, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, organic sales for the year increased 6% with currency translation having a negative impact of 1% and acquisitions contributing 8%. the organic growth was broad-based, with the company achieving growth in all three of its reporting segments. a strong bio-pharma end-market in the us and europe and additional market demand for protein platforms instruments were the biggest contributing factors to organic growth.
consolidated gaap net earnings decreased 27% for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. after adjusting for acquisition related costs, stock-based compensation, and certain income tax items in both years, adjusted net earnings increased 4% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. adjusted earnings growth was driven by strong volume leverage, which was offset by negative mix and a negative impact from foreign currency translation.
22
results of operations net sales consolidated organic net sales exclude the impact of net sales contributed by companies acquired during the fiscal year and the effect of the change from the prior year in exchange rates used to convert sales in foreign currencies (primarily the euro, british pound sterling, and chinese yuan) into u.s. dollars.
consolidated net sales growth was as follows:

gross margins consolidated gross margins were 67.2%, 66.5% and 67.5% in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2018, 2017, 2016 and prior years. under purchase accounting, inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs, resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold. excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles, adjusted gross margins were 71.5%, 71.2% and 70.8% in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages, adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales, is as follows:

fluctuations in adjusted gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix. we expect that, in the future, gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions.
management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the company's three business segments. since these results are used for this purpose, they are also considered to be prepared in accordance with gaap. segment gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, were as follows:
year ended june 30,

2018              2017              2016
biotechnology              79.4   %          80.5   %          80.0   %

diagnostics                43.5   %          42.3   %          44.8   %
the decrease in the biotechnology segment's gross margin percentage for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to mix of product sales made in this segment. the improvements in the protein platforms and diagnostics gross margin percentages for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 were due to higher volume leverage and operational productivity.
24
the biotechnology improvement for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to higher volume leverage and operational productivity. the diagnostics and protein platforms segment gross margin percentages for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by lower volume leverage and margin mix of product sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40.2 million (20%) and $59.6 million (42%) in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
the increase in fiscal 2018 was driven by additional investments in global commercial resources and administrative infrastructure, a larger cost base due to acquisitions and $13.6 million of additional stock-based compensation expense of which $8.3 million is from a new retirement policy that permits retirees to continue vesting in certain time-based stock options granted during employment, resulting in accelerated stock compensation expense for those employees meeting the definition of retirement eligible.
the increase in fiscal 2017 was driven by additional expenses associated with the space, acd and zephyrus acquisitions including $21.1 million of selling, general and administrative expenses, a $3.0 million increase in acquisition intangible amortization, a $18.4 million change in the fair value of contingent consideration and a $4.6 million increase in other acquisition related costs. the remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to additional investments in global commercial resources, administrative infrastructure, including increased stock compensation, and annual wage, salary and benefit increases.

during the third quarter fiscal 2018, the company recognized a $16.2 million impairment on the write-down of its investment in astute medical, inc. (astute) in anticipation of the amount of cash to be received upon completion of the sale of astute to a third party. the astute sale closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 at the anticipated amount. this loss was offset by a $16.1 million gain on the sale of a portion of the company's investment in chemocentryx, inc. (ccxi) and a $0.5 million gain on the sale of investment property in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. these gains and losses are included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.
income taxes income taxes for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were at effective rates of (0.2)%, 32.0%, and 29.2%, respectively, of consolidated earnings before income taxes. the effective rate for june 30, 2018 decreased by 32.2% compared to the prior year. the decrease in the company's tax rate for fiscal 2018 was due to the impact of discrete items, primarily the net tax benefit of $33.0 million related to government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). this net tax benefit consisted of $36.5 million due to the re-measurement of the company's deferred tax accounts to reflect the u.s. federal corporate tax rate reduction impact to our net deferred tax balances offset by expense for the repatriation tax of $3.3 million. also impacting the company's fiscal 2018 effective tax rate was a $2.2 million tax benefit related to stock option exercises offset by a net discrete tax expense of $4.2 million related to the revaluation of contingent consideration, which is not a tax deductible expense.
the effective rate for june 30, 2017 increased by 2.8% compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily due to unfavorable discrete events in fiscal 2017 related to the revaluation of contingent consideration, which is not a tax deductible expense. the company recognized net expense related to discrete tax items of $3.8 million in fiscal 2017, including $4.5 million in expense related to the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not a tax deductible expense. there were no material discrete tax items in fiscal 2016.
u.s. federal taxes have been reduced by the manufacturer's deduction provided for under the american jobs creation act of 2004 and the u.s. federal credit for research and development. foreign income taxes have been provided at rates which approximate the tax rates in the countries in which the company has operations, exclusive of permanent items.

the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and non-gaap tax rate applied to the identified non-gaap adjustments for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 is due primarily to recording the items attributable to the new tax legislation in the u.s. which resulted in a $33.0 million tax benefit. offsetting this benefit is the impact of the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not tax deductible. for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, the company recorded acquisition related expense of $20.1 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration.
the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and non-gaap tax rate applied to the identified non-gaap adjustments for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017 is primarily a result of the revaluation of contingent consideration, which is not tax deductible. for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017, the company recorded acquisition related expense of $18.4 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration.

(exosome) for approximately $250 million plus $325 million in potential contingent consideration.   in connection with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics on august 1, 2018, the company entered into a new credit facility governed by a credit agreement entered into on august 1, 2018 that matures on august 1, 2023.. the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $600 million, which can be increased by an additional $200 million subject to certain conditions, and a term loan of $250 million. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate.
future acquisition strategies may or may not require additional borrowings under the line-of-credit facility or other outside sources of funding.
cash flows from operating activities the company generated cash from operations of $170.4 million, $143.4 million, and $143.9 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was mainly the result of higher earnings and decreases in operating assets driven by strong collections of trade accounts receivable and increases in operating liabilities, net of acquisitions.
cash flows from investing activities we continue to make investments in our business, including capital expenditures. net cash paid for acquisitions of trevigen, atlanta biologicals and eurocell diagnostics was $67.9 million in fiscal 2018, a substantial decrease from the net cash paid of $253.8 million for the acd and space acquisitions in fiscal 2017. the company paid net cash of $91.4 million for the cliniqa and zephyrus acquisitions during fiscal 2016.

critical accounting policies management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap). the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations. the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies; investors should also refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. the calculations used to determine the fair value of the long-lived assets acquired, primarily intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgment. we weigh many factors when completing these estimates including, but not limited to, the nature of the acquired company's business; its competitive position, strengths, and challenges; its historical financial position and performance; estimated customer retention rates; discount rates; and future plans for the combined entity. we may also engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired long-lived assets.
the fair value of acquired technology is estimated, using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology. assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings. the fair value of acquired technology may also be estimated using the cost of reproduction method under which the primary components of the technology are identified and the estimated cost to reproduce the technology is calculated based on historical data provided by the acquirees. the fair value of trade names is estimated using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name. assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the trade name to estimate the royalty savings. we generally estimate the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. this valuation model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as a brand name or fixed assets, that contributed to the generation of the cash flows. the resulting cash flow, which is attributable solely to the customer list asset, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value. the fair value of acquired customer relationships may also be estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. assumptions used in these calculations include same-customer revenue growth rates and estimated customer retention rates based on the acquirees' historical information.
30
we estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made. assumptions used in these calculations include discount rates, projected financial results of the acquired businesses based on our most recent internal forecasts, and factors indicating the probability of achieving the forecasted results. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis.
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, which determines the amount of acquisition-related amortization expense we will record in future periods. each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
while we use our best estimates and assumptions, our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.
the judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income. for example, different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ. consequently, to the extent a longer-lived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorter-lived asset, net income in a given period may be higher. additionally, assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill. as goodwill is not amortized, this would benefit net income in a given period, although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis.
impairment of goodwill goodwill goodwill was $597.9 million as of june 30, 2018, which represented 37.5% of total assets. goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment.
to analyze goodwill for impairment, we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units. identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information. components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. we periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business.
31
2018 and 2017 goodwill impairment analyses in completing our 2018 and 2017 annual goodwill impairment analyses, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units. a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to its estimated fair value. carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit, which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. in accordance with asu 2017-04, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. in determining the fair values of our reporting units, we utilized the income approach. the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting unit's financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows. a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream. future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. the discount rate used was the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, we were required to estimate a number of factors, including projected operating results, terminal growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items.
because our 2018 and 2017 quantitative analyses included all of our reporting units, the summation of our reporting units' fair values was compared to our consolidated fair value, as indicated by our market capitalization, to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations.
the quantitative assessment completed as of june 30, 2018 and 2017 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom. this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows, as well as our selected discount rate. changes in the reporting unit's results, forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units.
2016 goodwill impairment analysis the company used a qualitative test for all reporting units during the fourth quarter for fiscal year 2016. the company elected to utilize a quantitative test for the protein platforms reporting unit for fiscal year 2016 using the previously described income approach given that this was a newer reporting unit created primarily through acquisitions. the qualitative analyses for our other reporting units completed during 2016 evaluated factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. in completing these assessments, we noted no changes in events or circumstances which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. based on the testing performed for the protein platforms reporting unit, fair value exceeded carrying value by a substantial amount and no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was necessary.
there has been no impairment of goodwill since the adoption of financial accounting standards board ("fasb") asc 350 guidance for goodwill and other intangibles on july 1, 2002.
new accounting pronouncements information regarding the accounting policies adopted during fiscal 2018 and those not yet adopted can be found under caption "note 1: description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appear in item 8 of this report.

subsequent events on july 2, 2018, the company acquired qt holdings corporation (quad) for approximately $20 million plus $51 million in potential contingent consideration. on august 1, 2018, the company acquired exosome diagnostics, inc. (exosome) for approximately $250 million plus $325 million in potential contingent consideration.
in connection with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics, inc. on august 1, 2018, the company entered into a new credit facility that provides for a revolving credit facility of $600 million, which can be increased by an additional $200 million subject to certain conditions, and a term loan of $250 million.  the credit facility is governed by a credit agreement dated august 1, 2018 and matures on august 1, 2023
non-gaap financial measures this annual report on form 10-k, including "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7, contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap). these non-gaap measures include:
●   adjusted gross margin

●   adjusted net earnings

●   adjusted net earnings growth

●   adjusted effective tax rate

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. we use these non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.
our non-gaap financial measures for adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, exclude the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, and acquisition related expenses. the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisition-related expenses, from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity.
the company's non-gaap adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes stock based compensation expense, restructuring, impairments of equity method investments, gain and losses from investments, and certain adjustments to income tax expense. stock based compensation is excluded from non-gaap adjusted earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically, the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types. impairments of equity investments are excluded as we do not have significant influence over these investments and they are not part of our day to day operating decisions. additionally, gains and losses from other investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded.   costs related to restructuring activities, including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities, are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs. the company independently calculates a non-gaap adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-gaap adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. in addition, the tax impact of other discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported gaap tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. we believe these tax items can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results.
the company periodically reassesses the components of our non-gaap adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance, changes in how we make financial and operational decisions, and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful.

item 1a.   risk factors below lists our risk factors updated for these events.
among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are:
industry risks:
pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including:
•   capacity utilization - our fmc lithium segment is sensitive to industry capacity utilization. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within the industry.
•   competition - all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. competition for our fmc agricultural solutions segment includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds. increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. also, there are changing competitive dynamics in the agrochemical industry as some of our competitors have consolidated, resulting in them having greater scale and diversity. these competitive differences may not be overcome and may erode our business.
•   changes in our customer base - our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our fmc lithium segment is most sensitive to this risk.
•   climatic conditions - our fmc agricultural solutions markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. for example, drought may reduce the need for fungicides, which could result in fewer sales and greater unsold inventories in the market, whereas excessive rain could lead to increased plant disease or weed growth requiring growers to purchase and use more pesticides. adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in argentina. natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict.
•   changing regulatory environment - changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states, brazil, china, argentina and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue producing and/or selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. our fmc agricultural solutions segment is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. many countries require re-registration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements; while we defend our products vigorously, these re-registration processes may result in significant additional data costs, reduced number of permitted product uses, or potential product cancellation. compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes the chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind the reach regulation is that manufacturers must verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely.
•   geographic presence outside of united states - with the acquisition of the dupont crop protection business, fmc agricultural solutions has a strong presence in latin america, europe and asia, as well as in the united states. growth of our geographic footprint particularly in europe and key asian countries such as india means that developments outside the united states will generally have a more significant effect on our operations than in the past. our operations outside the united states are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in currency values; exchange control
10
regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting u.s. companies doing business abroad.
•   pharmaceutical regulation - our fmc lithium facility in bessemer city, north carolina, and some of our manufacturing processes at that facility, as well as some of our customers, are subject to regulation by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and u.s. department of agriculture (usda) or similar foreign agencies. regulatory requirements of the fda and usda are complex, and any failure to comply with them including as a result of contamination due to acts of sabotage could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations.
•   climate change regulation - changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations.
•   fluctuations in commodity prices - our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities. we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in chemical raw material commodity pricing. accordingly, increases in such commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results. we use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks, where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms. however, we are unable to avoid the risk of medium- and long-term increases. additionally, fluctuations in harvested crop commodity prices could negatively impact our customers' ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity. inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers' abilities to pay for our products and, therefore, affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables.
•   supply arrangements - certain raw materials are critical to our production processes and our purchasing strategy and supply chain design are complex. while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and could lead to operational disruption and increase uncertainties around business performance. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, largely outside of the u.s. and principally in china. an inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products.
•   economic and political change - our business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, tariff increases or potential new tariffs, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by the united states government or foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. economic and political conditions within the united states and foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. in argentina, continued inflation and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our business. realignment of change in regional economic arrangements could have an operational impact on our businesses. in china, unpredictable enforcement of environmental regulations could result in unanticipated shutdowns in broad geographic areas, impacting our contract manufacturers and raw material suppliers.
operational risks:
•   market access risk - our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market.
•   business disruptions - we produce product through a combination of owned facilities and contract manufacturers. as a result of the dupont crop protection acquisition we now own and operate large-scale manufacturing facilities in the united states (mobile), puerto rico (manati) and china (pudong and jinshan) in addition to our legacy active ingredient plants in denmark (ronland) and india (panoli). this presents us with additional operating risks as our operating results will be dependent in part on the continued operation of the acquired production facilities. interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity of a particular manufacturing facility, or the profitability of our business as a whole. although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. these potential hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtimes, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other labor difficulties, information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation interruptions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic
11
or hazardous substances or gases, shipment of contaminated or off-specification product to customers, storage tank leaks, other environmental risks, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities.
•   information technology security risks - as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties' intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation, violations of various data privacy regulations in some jurisdictions, and also potentially result in liability to us. while we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with the european union's general data protection regulation and other data privacy regulations, these measures may be challenged by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. we could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate, we could face fines or penalties. this could damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
•   litigation and environmental risks - current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate.
•   hazardous materials - we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us.
•   environmental compliance - we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials. we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
•   compliance with laws and regulations: the global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly complex and requires more resources to effectively manage, which may increase the potential for misunderstanding or misapplication of regulatory standards.
•   workforce - the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. in addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization.
technology risks:
•   technological change - our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. our investment in the discovery and development of new pesticidal active ingredients for fmc agricultural solutions relies on discovery of new chemical molecules. such discovery processes depend on our scientists being able to find new molecules, which are novel and outside of patents held by others, and such molecules being efficacious against target pests without creating an undue risk to human health and the environment, and then meeting applicable regulatory criteria.
•   failure to make process improvements - failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position.
•   patents of competitors - some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete cost-effectively.
portfolio management and integration risks:
•   portfolio management risks - we continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives. if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth. failure to achieve these anticipated synergies, could materially and adversely affect our financial results. in addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. in implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets. the gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such
12
assets (e.g., divesting) may affect the company's earnings. moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings. significant effort will likely be required to ensure that the right mix of resources are trained, engaged and focused on achieving business objectives while adhering to our core values of safety, ethics and compliance.
•   intellectual property - our patents cover many of our products, manufacturing processes, and product uses, as well as many aspects of our research and development activities supporting our new product pipeline. patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities. our future performance will depend on our ability to address patent expirations through effective portfolio life cycle management for our high value assets.
◦   system implementation and integration risks - failure to successfully integrate the acquired dupont crop protection business and transition the management information systems of the dupont crop protection business from the erp system provided under transition services agreement by dupont to a management information system integrated with fmc's legacy processes could result in interruption of operations or failure to achieve synergies we expect. this could cause our future results of operations to be materially worse than expected.
•   major enterprise initiatives - we are working to spin off our fmc lithium segment in parallel to the continued integration of the dupont crop protection business assets into fmc agricultural solutions as well as implement other major initiatives such as the migration to a single global instance of sap s4 hana. these three projects will place significant demands on certain functions who are heavily involved in all three projects, particularly finance and information technology. failure to successfully execute such projects could materially and adversely affect our expected performance in fmc agricultural solutions and/or fmc lithium.
•   potential tax implications of fmc lithium separation - we have received an opinion from outside counsel to the effect that the spin-off of fmc lithium as a distribution to our stockholders qualifies as a non-taxable transaction for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the opinion is based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from both fmc and fmc lithium, as well as certain covenants by those parties. the opinion cannot be relied upon if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect. the opinion of counsel is not binding upon the irs or the courts and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. it is possible that the irs or a state or local taxing authority could take the position that aforementioned transaction results in the recognition of significant taxable gain by fmc, in which case fmc may be subject to material tax liabilities.
financial risks:
•   cyclicality - we may experience seasonal variations in the demand for our products given the nature of the crop protection market and the geographic regions in which we operate.
•   access to debt and capital markets - we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and working capital needs. limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results. moreover, interest payments, dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. we believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future. however, if we need external financing, our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally. there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results.
•   credit default risks - we may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. in the event of a default in this credit facility or any of our senior notes, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate.
•   exposure to global economic conditions - deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect both our own and our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to perform all their commitments to us. a slowdown in economic growth in our international markets, or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers.
13
•   foreign exchange rate risks - we are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. we are particularly sensitive to the brazilian real, the euro, the indian rupee, the chinese yuan, the mexican peso, and the argentine peso. our acquisition of the dupont crop protection business has significantly expanded our operations and sales in certain foreign countries and correspondingly may increase our exposure to foreign exchange risks.
•   uncertain tax rates - our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at different rates than the united states federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; currency gains and losses; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued.
•   uncertain recoverability of investments in long-lived assets - we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities.
•   pension and postretirement plans - obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. we operate in two distinct business segments: fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium. our fmc agricultural solutions segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as in non-agricultural markets for pest control. our fmc lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products, which are used primarily in energy storage, specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application.
2018 highlights the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended december 31, 2018:
•   revenue of $4,727.8 million in 2018 increased $1,849.2 million or approximately 64 percent versus last year. a more detailed review of revenues by segment is included under the section entitled "results of operations". on a regional basis, sales in north america increased 66 percent, sales in asia increased 81 percent and sales in europe, middle east and africa (emea) increased by 78 percent and sales in latin america increased by 40 percent.
•   our gross margin, excluding transaction-related charges, of $2,156.5 million increased $1,035.0 million or approximately 92 percent versus last year. gross margin, excluding transaction-related charges, as a percent of revenue is approximately 46 percent versus 39 percent in 2017. the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by higher margin products in fmc agricultural solutions as well as a full year of earnings from the acquired dupont crop protection business.
•   selling, general and administrative expenses increased 42 percent from $600.4 million to $851.2 million primarily due to the acquisition of the dupont crop protection business which is being integrated into our fmc agricultural solutions segment. selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding transaction-related charges, of $728.7 million increased $258.5 million or approximately 55 percent primarily due to a full year of operations of the acquired dupont crop protection business. transaction-related charges are presented in our adjusted earnings non-gaap financial measurement below under the section titled "results of operations".
•   research and development expenses of $291.5 million increased $150.0 million or 106 percent. the increase was primarily due to investments in discovery and product development from the newly acquired state of the art facilities from the dupont crop protection business acquisition.
•   net income (loss) attributable to fmc stockholders of $502.1 million decreased approximately $33.7 million from $535.8 million in the prior year period. net income in 2017 included the gain on sale of our discontinued fmc health and nutrition of approximately $727 million, net of tax which was partially offset by a provisional income tax charge of approximately $316 million related to the tax cuts and jobs act ("the act"). additionally, in 2018, we recorded a charge of $106.3 million related to active negotiations for a settlement agreement primarily to address discontinued operations at our environmental site in middleport, new york. these were partially offset by higher income from continuing operations in the current year driven by a full year of results from the dupont crop protection business. adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations attributable to fmc stockholders of $854.7 million increased approximately $486.4 million or 132 percent primarily due to higher results in fmc agricultural solutions. see the disclosure of our adjusted earnings non-gaap financial measurement below under the section titled "results of operations".
other 2018 highlights on october 15, 2018, livent closed on its ipo. after completion of the ipo and the underwriters' exercise to purchase additional shares of common stock, fmc owned 123 million shares of livent's common stock, representing approximately 84 percent of the total outstanding shares of livent's common stock. fmc presently intends to distribute the remaining livent shares on march 1, 2019. we will continue to consolidate livent as the fmc lithium reporting segment until the full separation date. at that time, results of livent will move to discontinued operations.
we began and advanced the implementation of the sap s/4 hana platform during 2018 as part of our transformation process.
2019 outlook
20
our 2019 expectation for the overall global crop protection market growth is that it will be flat to up low-single digits in u.s. dollars. we expect that fmc's above-market growth in 2019 will be driven by the continued strength in global demand for our diamides, pre-emergent herbicide growth, sales expansions in brazil, sulfonylurea herbicide growth in key european countries as well as new product introductions. we expect north america, emea and asia will also be flat to up low-single digits - driven by a variety of factors - and latin america will grow in the low- to mid-single digits. in north america, growth will come from an increase in corn acreage and normalized pest pressures.
we expect 2019 revenue for fmc will be in the range of approximately $4.45 billion to $4.55 billion, up approximately 5 percent at the midpoint year over year versus 2018 sales, excluding fmc lithium. we also expect total company adjusted ebitda(1) of $1.165 billion to $1.205 billion, which represents 7 percent growth at the midpoint versus 2018 recast results, excluding fmc lithium(2). 2019 adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.75 per diluted share(1), up 8 percent at the midpoint versus recast 2018, excluding any impact from share repurchases in 2019(2).
(1)   although we provide forecasts for adjusted earnings per share and total company adjusted ebitda (non-gaap financial measures), we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. certain elements of the composition of the gaap amounts are not predictable, making it impractical for us to forecast. such elements include, but are not limited to, restructuring, acquisition charges, and discontinued operations. as a result, no gaap outlook is provided.
(2)   recast calculations for 2018 exclude the lithium segment entirely, as we intend to show a true year-over-year comparable metric for the 2019 periods. the recast represents our best estimate at this time. due to complexities including u.s. tax reform, the full recasting is not yet completed. the completed recast results will be filed on a form 8-k in march 2019.

adjusted earnings reconciliation the following chart, which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements, depicts certain after-tax charges (gains). these items are excluded from the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performance-based compensation. these after-tax items are discussed in detail within the "other results of operations" section that follows. additionally, the chart below discloses our non-gaap financial measure "adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations attributable to fmc stockholders" reconciled from the gaap financial measure "net income (loss) attributable to fmc stockholders." we believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors. we also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges, non-operating pension and postretirement charges, certain non-gaap tax adjustments from operating results and discontinued operations allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. this measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with u.s. gaap.

____________________
(1)   the income tax expense (benefit) on corporate special charges (income) is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the corporate special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) based on the nature of the non-gaap performance measure.
(2)   we exclude the gaap tax provision, including discrete items, from the non-gaap measure of income, and instead include a non-gaap tax provision based upon the annual non-gaap effective tax rate. the gaap tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to current year ongoing business operations; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets; and changes in tax law which includes the impact of the act enacted on december 22, 2017. management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors
23
and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about fmc's operational performance.
in the discussion below, please refer to our chart titled "segment results reconciliation" within the results of operations section. all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted.
segment results for management purposes, segment ebitda is defined as segment revenue less operating expenses (segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses), excluding depreciation and amortization. we have excluded the following items from segment ebitda: corporate staff expense, interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures of businesses, restructuring and other charges (income), non-operating pension and postretirement charges, investment gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, last-in, first-out ("lifo") inventory adjustments, transaction-related charges, and other income and expense items.
information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.

2018 vs. 2017
revenue of $4,285.3 million increased $1,754.1 million, or approximately 69 percent versus the prior year period. the increase was primarily due to the revenue from the dupont crop protection acquisition, which was completed on november 1, 2017, and contributed approximately $1,742 million to the increase.
segment ebitda of $1,217.8 million increased by $641.7 million, or approximately 111 percent, compared to the prior year period. the increase was primarily driven by the addition of the results from the acquired dupont crop protection business.
refer to the fmc agricultural solutions pro forma financial results with the dupont crop protection business section below for further discussion.
2017 vs. 2016
revenue of $2,531.2 million increased approximately 11 percent versus the prior year period. higher volumes contributed 12 percent to the increase while favorable foreign currency had an impact of 1 percent. the acquired dupont crop protection business contributed 8 percent to these higher volumes, or approximately $193 million. these increases were partially offset by lower pricing which impacted revenue by 2 percent.
segment ebitda of $576.1 million increased approximately 20 percent compared to the year-ago period. the higher volumes discussed above impacted the change in ebitda by approximately 43 percent and favorable foreign currency impacted the change in ebitda by approximately 5 percent. the acquired business represented a majority of these higher volumes. offsetting these increases were lower pricing which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 11 percent as well as higher costs which unfavorably impacted the segment by approximately 17 percent to the increase. the higher costs were also due to the recently acquired business.
fmc agricultural solutions pro forma financial results with the dupont crop protection business we began to present pro forma combined results for the fmc agricultural solutions segment in the first quarter of 2018. we believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the fmc agricultural solutions segment is more useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of this segment. our pro forma segment information includes adjustments as if the dupont crop protection business acquisition had occurred on january 1, 2016. our pro forma data is also adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting but does not include adjustments for

costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that might be achieved by the combined businesses. pro forma amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the dupont crop protection business since january 1, 2016, nor our future results.

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2018, pro forma results and actual results are the same.
(2)   pro forma combined revenue by region for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 includes the results of the dupont crop protection business of $1,325.4 million and $1,439.3 million, respectively, assuming the acquisition occurred on january 1, 2016. these amounts include adjustments as if the dupont crop protection business acquisition had occurred on january 1, 2016. the pro forma combined revenue by region amounts are not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we acquired the dupont crop protection business on january 1, 2016 or indicative of future results.
(3)   increase in the year ended december 31, 2018 was due primarily to strong growth of the acquired insecticides and herbicides, the move to direct market access in france, as well as sales synergies of legacy fmc products. these were partially offset by a forced divestiture (anti-trust remedy), unfavorable weather conditions that led to a shorter growing season and lower demand in northern and central europe.
(4)   increase in the year ended december 31, 2018 was due to very strong demand for the acquired insecticides, growth in u.s. soy acreage in 2018, and strong demand across niche crops. these were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from the delayed start to the spring season.
(5)   increase in the year ended december 31, 2018 was due to strong growth for the acquired insecticides in soybean and other crops, strong acreage growth in cotton and higher prices in brazil as well as higher wheat acreage in argentina. partially offsetting these increases were unfavorable foreign currency impacts and severe drought in argentina.
(6)   increase in the year ended december 31, 2018 was due to strong performance in rice and soy insecticides in india and growth in rice herbicides in china which was partially offset by a forced divestiture in india (anti-trust remedy), the rationalization of the legacy portfolio in india and extreme drought conditions in australia.

pro forma combined results - 2018 vs. 2017
pro forma combined revenue of $4,285.3 million increased by approximately 11 percent versus the prior year period. refer to the fmc agricultural solutions pro forma combined revenue by region chart above for further discussion.
pro forma combined segment ebitda of $1,217.8 million increased approximately 15 percent compared to the prior year. the increase was primarily driven by revenue growth discussed above as our sales organization leveraged valuable cross-selling opportunities due to minimal customer overlap with dupont. additionally, we reduced expected operating costs for the acquired dupont crop protection business through accelerated functional integration, leveraging our back office infrastructure and reducing manufacturing costs at the acquired plants. these were partially offset by higher raw material costs which have had a negative impact on results year over year. this is impacting the chemical industry broadly as the chinese government has been shutting down industrial parks as part of their environmental program. we have been able to mitigate and manage the impact on our ability to supply our customer due to our diversified supply chain network.
for 2019, full-year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $4.45 billion to $4.55 billion.

segment ebitda        195.7                 141.9                  85.0
2018 vs. 2017
revenue of $442.5 million increased by approximately 27 percent versus the prior-year period primarily driven by higher volumes which impacted revenue by approximately 21 percent. additionally, improved pricing and mix added approximately 8 percent to the change in revenue. foreign currency had an unfavorable impact on the change in revenue of approximately 2 percent.
segment ebitda of $195.7 million increased approximately $54 million versus the year ago period. the higher volumes noted above impacted ebitda by $46 million while improved pricing and mix had an approximately $27 million impact. these increases were offset by approximately $20 million in costs due to higher raw material prices as well as standalone costs related to the separation of livent. foreign currency had a slightly unfavorable impact on the change in ebitda.
we announced that we will distribute the remaining livent shares on march 1, 2019. at that time, results of fmc lithium will move to discontinued operations.
2017 vs. 2016
revenue of $347.4 million increased by approximately 32 percent versus the prior-year period driven by improved pricing and mix, which accounted for a 23 percent increase. additionally, higher volumes impacted revenue by 9 percent. foreign currency had a minimal impact on the change in revenue.
segment ebitda of $141.9 million increased approximately $57 million versus the year ago period. the improved pricing and mix noted above impacted ebitda by approximately $60 million while volume contributed to the change by approximately $11 million. these increases were offset by higher raw material prices and energy prices as well as expansion related costs by approximately $13 million. foreign currency had a negative impact of less than $1 million on the change in ebitda.
corporate and other corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item "selling, general and administrative expenses" except for last in, first-out (lifo) related charges that are included as a component of "cost of sales and other services" on our consolidated statements of income (loss).
2018 vs. 2017
corporate and other expenses of $108.9 million increased by $13.8 million from $95.1 million in 2017. the increase was primarily driven by higher lifo expense of approximately $5 million compared to the prior year. additionally, the increase was due to negative foreign currency impacts of approximately $3 million, which was mainly due to the foreign exchange impacts on intercompany fund movements in 2018.
2017 vs. 2016
26
corporate and other expenses of $95.1 million increased by $15.5 million from $79.6 million in 2016. the increase was driven by approximately $6 million of corporate incentives due to higher business results and share-based compensation. additionally, the prior period included approximately $7 million of lifo income that did not recur in 2017. the remaining increase was due to other corporate items including corporate facility costs, foreign exchange losses and other shared corporate costs.
depreciation and amortization
2018 vs. 2017
depreciation and amortization of $168.2 million increased $55.2 million as compared to 2017 of $113.0 million. approximately $56 million of the increase was due to the increase in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired as a result of the dupont crop protection business.
2017 vs. 2016
depreciation and amortization of $113.0 million increased $12.4 million as compared to the prior year of $100.6 million. approximately $14 million of the increase was due to the increase in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired as a result of the dupont crop protection business partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization expense in the legacy fmc agricultural solutions segment.
interest expense, net
2018 vs. 2017
interest expense, net of $133.1 million increased by approximately 68 percent compared to $79.1 million in 2017. the increase was driven by the addition of the 2017 term loan facility which increased interest expense by approximately $30 million, and higher interest rates which increased interest expense by approximately $6 million. the remaining increase of approximately $17 million was due to zero interest allocated to discontinued operations in 2018 as compared to 2017, due to the divestment of the fmc health and nutrition business to dupont in 2017. interest was previously allocated in accordance with relevant discontinued operations accounting guidance.
2017 vs. 2016
interest expense, net of $79.1 million increased by approximately 26 percent compared to $62.9 million in 2016. the increase was driven by the impacts of higher foreign debt balances of approximately $6 million, the addition of the 2017 term loan facility of $6 million, and increases in interest rates of approximately $4 million.

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2018 were primarily associated with restructuring charges within fmc agricultural solutions associated with the integration of the dupont crop protection business. these charges primarily consisted of approximately $59 million of charges related to the change in our market access model in india and approximately $28 million of charges due to our decision to exit the ewing r&d center as discussed above. refer to note 8 for more information. other restructuring charges within fmc agricultural solutions as we continue to integrate the acquired dupont crop protection business totaled approximately $22 million.
27
other charges (income), net in 2018 primarily consists of income from the gain on sales of $87.2 million from the divestment of a portion of fmc's european herbicide portfolio to nufarm limited and certain products of our india portfolio to crystal crop protection limited. these divestitures satisfied fmc's commitment to the european commission and the competition commission of india, respectively, for regulatory requirements in order to complete the dupont crop protection acquisition. additionally, there were environmental related charges of $21.9 million for remediation activities and $2.6 million of other charges.
2017
restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2017 were primarily associated with charges in our fmc lithium segment of $7.8 million related to miscellaneous restructuring. there were also impairment charges of intangible assets within fmc agricultural solutions of $2.2 million. in corporate, there were asset write-downs of approximately $5.5 million. amounts also include miscellaneous restructuring charges of $0.8 million.
other charges (income), net in 2017 consisted of a $42.1 million impairment on certain indefinite-lived intangible assets from the acquired dupont crop protection business acquisition as a result of a triggering event due to the act. other charges (income) also includes $16.6 million for continuing environmental sites treated as corporate charges. additionally, we incurred exit costs of $4.8 million resulting from the termination and de-consolidation of our interest in a variable interest entity that was previously consolidated and was part of our fmc agricultural solutions segment. we had other miscellaneous charges, net of approximately $1.6 million.
2016
restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2016 totaled $43.4 million. included in this were final charges totaling $42.3 million associated with the integration of cheminova into our existing fmc agricultural solutions segment. this amount included final adjustments to severances, long lived asset write offs, contract termination costs and other miscellaneous items. there were miscellaneous restructuring charges of $1.1 million.
other charges (income), net in 2016 consisted of $36.8 million for continuing environmental sites treated as corporate charges, $13.2 million associated with a license agreement to obtain certain technology and intellectual property rights for new compounds still under development and $4.2 million as a result of the argentina government's action to devalue its currency. these charges were partially offset by other miscellaneous income of $2.6 million.
non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income non-operating pension and postretirement (charges) income are included in "selling, general and administrative expenses" on our consolidated statements of income (loss).
2018 vs. 2017
the charge for 2018 was $3.8 million compared to $18.2 million in 2017. 2017 included $35.7 million of settlement charges primarily related to the termination of our u.k. plan. the decrease in settlements was partially offset by lower expected return on plan assets due to the shift to a primarily fixed income investment portfolio of $15.5 million versus 2017. see note 14 for more information.
2017 vs. 2016
the charge for 2017 was $18.2 million compared to $23.4 million in 2016. the decrease was the result of $22.8 million lower amortization of net actuarial losses as a result of a change in estimate in fiscal 2017 to amortize the gains and losses over the expected life time of the inactive population rather than the average remaining service period of the active participants which was partially offset by an increase of $15.4 million for recognized losses due to plan settlements. see note 14 for more information.
transaction-related charges a detailed description of the transaction related charges is included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k and in the segment results reconciliation above within the "results of operations" section of the management's discussion and analysis.
provision for income taxes a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries (e.g., singapore and hong kong), which tax earnings at lower rates than the united states federal statutory rate. our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the united states federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance;
28
changes in tax law; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued.
provision for income taxes for 2018 was expense of $88.8 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 11.9 percent. provision for income taxes for 2017 was expense of $264.1 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 146.1 percent primarily attributable to the $315.9 million of provisional tax expense associated with the act. provision for income taxes for 2016 was $50.1 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 27.7 percent. note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k includes more details on the drivers of the gaap effective rate and year-over-year changes. we believe showing the reconciliation below of our gaap to non-gaap effective tax rate provides investors with useful supplemental information about our tax rate on the core underlying business.

_______________
(1)   tax adjustments in 2018 and 2017 are materially attributable to the effects of the act and primarily relate to the one-time transition tax, the decrease in the u.s. federal tax rate, and the realizability of certain u.s. state deferred tax assets. tax adjustments in 2017 were primarily associated with the provisional income tax expense recorded as a result of the enactment of the act in december 2017. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k for additional discussion. tax adjustments in 2016 were primarily associated with valuation allowance adjustments to u.s. state deferred tax balances.
the primary drivers for the decrease in the year-to-date effective tax rate for 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 are shown in the table above. the remaining change for 2017 compared to 2016 was due to reduced domestic earnings in our fmc agricultural solutions business and the impact of the full integration of cheminova into our global supply chain.
discontinued operations, net of income taxes our discontinued operations, in periods up to its sale, represent our discontinued fmc health and nutrition and fmc alkali chemicals business results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from other previously discontinued operations. the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities, other postretirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance, long-term obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our discontinued operations.
2018 vs. 2017
discontinued operations, net of income taxes represented a loss of $143.4 million in 2018 compared to income of $621.7 million in 2017. the decrease was primarily driven by the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition to dupont in the fourth quarter of 2017 which resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $727 million, which did not recur in 2018. discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in 2017 also includes the impairment charge of approximately $148 million, net of tax, to reflect the write down of our omega-3 business to its sales price. during 2018, we recorded a charge of approximately $106 million as a result of active negotiations for a settlement agreement primarily to address discontinued operations at our middleport, new york plant which was the subject of an administrative order on consent entered into with the epa and nysdec in 1991. the charge consists of incremental estimated costs of remediation for certain offsite operable units associated with historic site operations as we engage in settlement discussions with nysdec to resolve the path forward regarding remediation. refer to note 11 for further details.
2017 vs. 2016
discontinued operations, net of income taxes represented income of $621.7 million in 2017 compared to income of $81.0 million in 2016. the increase was primarily driven by the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition to dupont which resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $727 million. amount also includes the impairment charge of approximately $148 million, net of tax, to reflect the write down our omega-3 business to its sales price.

net income (loss) attributable to fmc stockholders
2018 vs. 2017
net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to $502.1 million from $535.8 million. the decrease was primarily due to the gain on sale recorded in discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the prior year as well as charges related to the middleport environmental settlement as discussed above. these were offset by higher income from continuing operations driven by a full year of results from the dupont crop protection business, which was completed on november 1, 2017.
2017 vs. 2016
net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to $535.8 million from $209.1 million. the increase was primarily due to the gain on sale recorded in discontinued operations, net of income taxes as discussed above, offset by the impacts of u.s. tax reform and increases in acquisition-related charges. refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k.

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2018 and 2017, were $161.7 million and $283.0 million, respectively. of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2018, $107.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. as a result of the act, in 2017 we recognized a one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the remeasurement of the company's u.s. net deferred tax asset. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k for more information. the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operating activities and future foreign investments. we have not provided income taxes for any additional outside basis differences inherent in our investments in subsidiaries because the investments and related unremitted earnings are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise upon disposal. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k for more information.
pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement, on october 18, 2018, we received a net distribution of approximately $317 million from livent representing the proceeds from the sale of its common stock as part of the ipo, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering related expenses. on october 31, 2018, we used $150 million of those proceeds to further pay down term loan debt. this increased our cumulative debt reduction in 2018 to approximately $550 million. on november 15, 2018, we received an additional net distribution of approximately $48 million from livent representing the proceeds from the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares.
at december 31, 2018, we had total debt of $2,726.7 million as compared to $3,185.6 million at december 31, 2017. total debt included $2,179.0 million and $2,993.0 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $386.0 million and $101.2 million) at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. see note 13 in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further details.
the decrease in long-term debt was due to the repayment of the 2014 term loan facility. at december 31, 2018, $1,400.0 million remained outstanding under the 2017 term loan facility, which is scheduled to mature on november 1, 2022. the borrowings under the 2017 term loan facility will bear interest at a floating rate, which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period, plus in each case an applicable margin, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the 2017 term loan facility.
our short-term debt consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program. foreign borrowings increased from $91.4 million at december 31, 2017 to $106.5 million at december 31, 2018 while outstanding commercial paper increased $55.2 million from zero at december 31, 2017.

____________________
(1)   the changes in cash flows related to trade receivables in 2018 and 2017 were primarily driven by timing of collections largely due to seasonality. additionally, the change in 2018 was related to receivable build from the acquired dupont crop protection business as we did not acquire any receivables as part of the transaction. collection timing is more pronounced in our fmc agricultural solutions business where sales, particularly in brazil, can have a longer collection period. additionally, timing of collection is impacted as amounts for both periods include carry-over balances remaining to be collected in latin america, where collection periods are measured in months rather than weeks. during 2018, we collected approximately $900 million of receivables in brazil. a significant proportion of the collections in brazil are coming from those accounts that were past due at the start of the year, improving the quality of the remaining receivable balance.
(2)   changes in inventory are a result of inventory levels being adjusted to take into consideration the change in market conditions primarily in fmc agricultural solutions. the increase was also driven by higher sales and recovering inventory levels due to a faster return to full production from our china toll manufacturing partners.
(3)   accounts payable in both 2018 and 2017 was primarily impacted by the payable build from the acquired dupont crop protection business as we did not acquire any payables as part of the transaction, as well as the timing of payments made to suppliers and vendors.
(4)   these rebates are associated with our fmc agricultural solutions segment in north america and brazil and generally settled in the fourth quarter of each year. the changes year over year are primarily associated with the mix in sales eligible for rebates and incentives in 2018 compared to 2017 and timing of rebate payments, and we did not acquire the rebates of the dupont crop protection business.
(5)   the advance payments from customers represent advances from our fmc agricultural solutions segment customers. revenue associated with advance payments is recognized, generally in the first quarter of each year, as shipments are made and title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer.
(6)   changes in all periods presented primarily represent timing of payments associated with all other operating assets and liabilities, including guarantees issued to vendors under our vendor finance program. additionally, the 2018 period includes the effects of the unfavorable contracts amortization of approximately $103 million.
(7)   see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further details.
(8)   included in our results for each of the years presented are environmental charges for environmental remediation at our operating sites of $21.9 million, $16.6 million and $36.8 million, respectively. the amounts in 2018 will be spent in future years. the amounts represent environmental remediation spending at our operating sites which were recorded against pre-existing reserves, net of recoveries.
33
environmental obligations for continuing operations primarily represent obligations at shut down or abandoned facilities within businesses that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations.
(9)   amounts include voluntary contributions to our u.s. qualified defined benefit plan of $30.0 million, $44.0 million and $35.0 million, respectively.
(10)   the increase in interest payments is primarily due to higher foreign debt balances, the addition of the 2017 term loan facility, and increases in interest rates.
(11)   tax payments in 2018 primarily represent the payments of tax attributable to the fmc health and nutrition segment disposition, transition tax and tax payments related to the integration of the dupont crop protection business.
(12)   amounts are presented as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows in 2016 from share-based compensation.
(13)   2018 and 2017 activity primarily represents payments for legal and professional fees associated with the dupont crop protection business acquisition in addition to costs related to integrating the dupont crop protection business as well as spending for separation related activities. 2016 activity represents payments for legal and professional fees associated with the cheminova acquisition. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
cash provided (required) by operating activities of discontinued operations was $(77.6) million, $21.0 million and $128.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations is directly related to environmental, other postretirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance, long-term obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities.
amounts in 2017 and 2016 included the operating activities of our discontinued fmc health and nutrition segment. amounts in 2017 were partially offset by divestiture costs associated with the sale of fmc health and nutrition, which was completed on november 1, 2017.
cash provided (required) by investing activities of continuing operations was $(115.9) million, $(1,349.5) million and $(100.8) million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
cash required in 2018 is primarily due to the sale of product portfolios of approximately $88.0 million that were required to complete the dupont crop protection business acquisition, fully offset by higher capital expenditure spending in 2018 as well as incremental capitalizable corporate level spending associated with the implementation of a new sap system.
the change in cash required by investing activities in 2017 is primarily due to the acquisition of the dupont crop protection business.
cash provided (required) by investing activities of discontinued operations was $(15.0) million, $15.7 million and $(34.4) million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
cash required by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2018 represents the working capital payment associated with the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition.
cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2017 includes the cash proceeds from the sale of the omega-3 business for $38.0 million.
cash provided (required) by financing activities was $(363.3) million, $1,213.1 million and $(377.0) million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the change in cash required by financing activities in 2018 is due to higher repayments of long-term debt of approximately $200 million as compared to 2017 and $200 million in repurchases of common stock in the current year as part of the publicly announced repurchase program. additionally, there were borrowings of long-term debt in the prior year. the cash required in the current period was partially offset by the proceeds received from the ipo of fmc lithium of $363.6 million.
the change in cash provided by financing activities in 2017 primarily related to the increase in proceeds from borrowings of long-term debt mostly to fund the dupont crop protection business acquisition, partially offset by higher repayments of long-term debt during the year.
2019 outlook and other potential liquidity needs in 2019, we expect a continued improvement in cash generation. in aggregate, we expect operating cash flow (non-gaap) to increase driven by higher earnings, including the continued benefits from the integration of the dupont crop protection business, partially offset by higher working capital requirements in 2019.
our cash needs for 2019 outside of costs to separate fmc lithium include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, share repurchases, contributions to our pension plans, environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring. additionally, we expect to continue to incur costs associated with integrating the dupont crop protection business due to its significance and complexity. the majority of these costs are expected to completed by the first quarter of 2020. we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash
34
generated from operations, commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2018 our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was $1,245.8 million.
projected 2019 capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to increase, excluding fmc lithium, to approximately $150 million. the increase is primarily driven by capacity expansion. additionally, we will continue to incur spending associated with the two-year implementation of a new sap system.
projected 2019 spending includes approximately $75 million to $80 million of net environmental remediation spending at both our continuing and discontinued sites. this projected spending for 2019 includes spending as a result of active negotiations for a settlement agreement primarily to address discontinued operations at our middleport, new york site. we expect the settlement will result in spending of approximately $20 million to $30 million per year for years 2019 - 2021, due to front loading of reimbursement in installments of past costs, and a $10 million maximum per year, on average, until the remediation is complete. this projected spending does not include expected spending on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities or expected spending for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of "costs of sales and services" in our consolidated statements of income (loss) since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections.
as a result of the act, we will continue to pay the remaining $161.3 million of transition tax over the next seven years.
our u.s. pension plan assets decreased from $1,334.9 million at december 31, 2017 to $1,265.0 million at december 31, 2018. our u.s. pension plan assets comprise approximately all of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k for details on how we develop our long-term rate of return assumptions. we made contributions of $30.0 million and $44.0 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and intend to contribute $7 million in 2019. our contributions in 2017, 2018 and our intended contribution in 2019 are all in excess of the minimum requirements. our contributions in excess of minimums are done with the objective of avoiding variable rate pension benefit guaranty corporation ("pbgc") premiums as well as potentially reducing future funding volatility. in 2017, we changed our u.s. qualified pension plan's investment strategy to a liability hedging approach with an objective of minimizing funded status volatility. as a result, we expect lower contributions in future periods. the portfolio is comprised of 100 percent fixed income securities and cash. investment performance and related risks are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through monthly liability measurements, periodic asset liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, 2.4 million shares were repurchased under the prior publicly announced repurchase program adopted in 2013. at december 31, 2018, $1.0 billion remained unused under our board-authorized repurchase program. we intend to purchase a total of up to $500 million of our common shares in 2019. this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time. shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting, exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans.
dividends on january 17, 2019, we paid dividends aggregating $53.2 million to our shareholders of record as of december 31, 2018. this amount is included in "accrued and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2018. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid $89.2 million, $88.8 million and $88.6 million in dividends, respectively.
commitments we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain fmc agricultural solutions customers, principally brazilian customers, for their seasonal borrowing. the total of these guarantees was $71.3 million at december 31, 2018. these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates. non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity. our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered unlikely.
short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines and commercial paper at december 31, 2018 and foreign credit lines at december 31, 2017. we provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries.
in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities, including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale. our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible, minimum claim amount or cap. in cases where it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss, no specific liability has been recorded. if triggered, we may be able to recover
35
certain of the indemnity payments from third parties. in cases where it is possible, we have recorded a specific liability within our reserve for discontinued operations. refer to note 10 for further details.
our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows:
contractual commitments                                                                                                              expected cash payments by year

(1)   excluding discounts.
(2)   contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. we had $1,200 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at december 31, 2018. the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at december 31, 2018. variable rates are determined by the market and will fluctuate over time.
(3)   obligations associated with operating leases, before sub-lease rental income.
(4)   obligations associated with our shanghai, china research and technology center.
(5)   derivative contracts were in a net asset position as of december 31, 2018. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10-k. as a result, they are excluded from the table above.
(6)   purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. we have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or-pay commitments over the life of the contract and not a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts.
(7)   as of december 31, 2018, the liability for uncertain tax positions was $82.4 million. this liability is excluded from the table above. additionally, accrued pension and other postretirement benefits and our environmental liabilities as recorded on our consolidated balance sheets are excluded from the table above. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid. also excluded from the table above is the liability attributable to the transition tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings incurred as a result of the act of $161.3 million.
contingencies see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
climate change as a global corporate citizen, we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce green house gas (ghg) emissions to the atmosphere.
fmc is committed to doing its part to address climate change and its impacts. we have set 2025 goals that we will reduce both energy intensity and ghg intensity for our operations by 15 percent from our 2013 baseline year. to date, our fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium segments have reduced energy use by 18 percent and 13 percent and ghg intensity by 12 percent and 18 percent, respectively. fmc has been reporting its ghg emissions and mitigation strategy to cdp (formerly carbon disclosure project) since 2016. fmc detailed the business risks and opportunities we have due to climate change and its impacts in our cdp climate change reports.
even as we take action to control the release of ghgs, additional warming is anticipated. long-term, higher average global temperatures could result in induced changes in natural resources, growing seasons, precipitation patterns, weather patterns, species distributions, water availability, sea levels, and biodiversity. these impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain fmc's production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs. depending on how pervasive the climate impacts are in the different geographic locations experiencing changes in natural resources, fmc's customers could be impacted. demand for fmc's products could increase if our products meet our customers' needs to adapt to climate change impacts or decrease if our products do not meet their needs. within our own operations, we continually assess our manufacturing sites worldwide for risks and opportunities to increase our preparedness for climate change. we are continuing to evaluate sea level
36
rise and storm surge at our plants located within 4 meters of sea level to understand timing of potential impacts and response actions that may need to be taken. to lessen fmc's overall environmental footprint, we have taken actions to increase the energy efficiency in our manufacturing sites. we have also committed to 2025 goals to reduce our water use in high-risk areas by 20 percent and our waste intensities by 15 percent. to date, fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium have reduced our water use in high risk areas by 25 percent and 14 percent and our waste disposal intensity by 28 percent and 18 percent, respectively.
recently fmc has undergone significant changes with the acquisition of the dupont crop protection business, the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition, and the anticipated separation of fmc lithium. therefore, we are revising our goals to reflect these changes and they will be published in our 2018 sustainability report.
in our product portfolio, we see market opportunities for our products to address climate change and its impacts. for example, fmc's agricultural products can help customers increase yield, energy and water efficiency, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. our products can also help growers adapt to more unpredictable growing conditions and the effects these types of threats have on crops.
we are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help mitigate impacts of climate change. fmc agricultural solutions is developing products with a lighter environmental footprint in its biologicals products. these opportunities could lead to new products and services for our existing and potential customers. beyond our products and operations, fmc recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs. therefore, we will actively work with our entire value chain - suppliers, contractors, and customers - to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their ghg emissions.
we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations. in december 2015, 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris reached an agreement to reduce ghgs. it remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement. the united states is a signatory to the paris agreement, but on june 1, 2017, president trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement and on august 4, 2017, the united states delivered notice of its intention to withdraw to united nations. on october 16, 2017, the united states environmental protection agency ("epa") filed notice of a rulemaking to repeal the lean power plan. epa followed this action with the issuance of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the proper roles of the state and federal government in regulating emissions from electric power plants, and also seeking information on technologies and strategies for reducing emissions from existing plants.
notwithstanding the united states' withdrawal from the paris agreement, will actively manage climate risks and incorporate them in our decision making as indicated in our responses to the cdp climate change module. the united states climate alliance, a coalition of 21 states and unincorporated self-governing territories in the united states have expressed their commitment to upholding the objectives of the 2015 paris agreement on climate change within their borders. several of our manufacturing and r&d sites fall within this alliance territory. fmc remains deeply committed to reducing our ghg emissions and energy consumption at all of our facilities around the world.
some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation, such as our plant in denmark that is subject to the eu emissions trading scheme. at present, that plant's emissions are below its designated cap.
future ghg regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy, additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment, and/or costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes. we are currently monitoring regulatory developments. the costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"). the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. we have described our accounting policies in note 1 "principal accounting policies and related financial information" to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. we have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors. critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with u.s. gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors.
revenue recognition and trade receivables we recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy our performance obligation which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms. refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for more information.
we record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue. costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services. amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements. we record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority.
we periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers, primarily in our fmc agricultural solutions segment, and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods. these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as "advance payments from customers" on the consolidated balance sheet. revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and transfer of control to the customer takes place.
trade receivables consist of amounts owed to us from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized. the allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults. in developing our allowance for trade receivables, we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions.
our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience, current collection trends, and external business factors such as economic factors, including regional bankruptcy rates, and political factors. our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly, and the allowance is adjusted accordingly.
we also hold long-term receivables that represent long-term customer receivable balances related to past-due accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year. our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables. therefore on an ongoing basis, we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our long-term receivables utilizing aging of receivables, collection experience and write-offs, as well as existing economic conditions, to determine if an additional allowance is necessary.
on january 1, 2018, accounting standards update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, became effective. see note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for more information.
environmental obligations and related recoveries we provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used.
estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency ("epa"), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision ("rod"), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a remedial investigation/feasibility study ("ri/fs"), or equivalent, that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by
38
financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.
our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment. such costs principally include, among other items, ri/fs, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, management costs, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants' engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites.
included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation, maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans (om&m). such reserves are based on our best estimates for these om&m plans. over time we may incur om&m costs in excess of these reserves. however, we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such om&m plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation, as conditions at these environmental sites change over time. such additional om&m costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years.
included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies, which we believe are probable of recovery.
provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties ("prps") or other third parties. such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values.
in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("cercla") and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible. we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects. recoveries are recorded as either an offset in "environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued" or as "other assets" in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with u.s. accounting literature.
see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations.
impairments and valuation of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets our long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates and discount rates. although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.
we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time.
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets. in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units,
39
anticipated changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices. based on our assessment for 2018, we determined that no goodwill impairment charge to our continuing operations was required. the majority of the brands intangible asset relates to our proprietary brand portfolio for which the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value. during the third quarter of 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $2 million in our generic brand portfolio which is part of the fmc agricultural solutions segment. the carrying value of the generic portfolio subsequent to the charge is approximately $3 million.
see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for charges associated with long-lived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves.
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees. the costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees. the costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. to the extent our plans' actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans' demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans' funding requirements, could increase or decrease. when actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. in addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods.
we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans' funding requirements. the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans' funding requirements. the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly.
we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. in selecting a discount rate as of december 31, 2018, we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yield-curve provided by our actuary. this yield-curve, when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans' benefit payments, produced an effective discount rate of 4.35 percent for our u.s. qualified plan, 3.97 percent for our u.s. nonqualified, and 4.08 percent for our u.s. other postretirement benefit plans.
the discount rates used at our december 31, 2018 and 2017 measurement dates for the u.s. qualified plan were 4.35 percent and 3.68 percent, respectively. the effect of the change in the discount rate from 3.68 percent to 4.35 percent at december 31, 2018 resulted in a $91.3 million decrease to our u.s. qualified pension benefit obligations. the effect of the change in the discount rate from 4.22 percent at december 31, 2016 to 3.68 percent at december 31, 2017 resulted in a $0.1 million increase to the 2018 u.s. qualified pension expense.
the change in discount rate from 3.68 percent at december 31, 2017 to 4.35 percent at december 31, 2018 was attributable to an increase in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2017 and 2018 measurement dates. using the december 31, 2018 and 2017 yield curves, our u.s. qualified plan cash flows produced a single weighted-average discount rate of approximately 4.35 percent and 3.68 percent, respectively.
in developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our u.s. plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. we also consider the historical performance of our own plan's trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 6.9 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors which are discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k. our long-term rate of return for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 5.00 percent, 6.50 percent and 7.00 percent, respectively.
for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below.

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions.
a one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $62.4 million and $73.6 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $5.2 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. a one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $68.3 million and $81.3 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit cost by $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $5.7 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
a one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $6.4 million, $6.0 million and $6.0 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. a one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $6.4 million, $6.0 million and $6.0 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k.
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. in assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.
additionally, we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. certain income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the u.s. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. we adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law.
on december 22, 2017, the act was enacted in the united states. the act reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. at december 31, 2018, the company had completed its accounting for the impacts of the enactment of the act.
see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes.

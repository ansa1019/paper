dividend restrictions cpuc holding company rules require that sce's dividend policy be established by sce's board of directors on the same basis as if sce were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of sce, as deemed to be necessary to meet sce's electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the boards of directors of both edison international and sce. in addition, the cpuc regulates sce's capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay to its shareholders. under sce's interpretation of cpuc regulations, the common equity component of sce's capital structure must remain at or above 48% on a weighted average basis over the 37 -month period that sce's capital structure is in effect for ratemaking purposes. as allowed under the revised san onofre settlement agreement, which was approved by the cpuc in july 2018, sce has excluded a $448 million after-tax charge resulting from the implementation of the revised san onofre settlement agreement from its ratemaking capital structure (see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-permanent retirement of san onofre" for further information on the revised san onofre settlement agreement). at december 31, 2018 , sce's 37 -month average common equity component of total capitalization was 49.7% and the maximum additional dividend that sce could pay to edison international under this limitation after paying preferred and preference shareholders was $459 million , resulting in a restriction on net assets of approximately $13.3 billion .
140
under sce's interpretation of the cpuc's capital structure decisions, sce is required to file an application for a waiver of the 48% equity ratio condition discussed above if an adverse financial event reduces its spot equity ratio below 47% . on february 28, 2019, sce is submitting an application to the cpuc for waiver of compliance with this equity ratio requirement, describing that while the charge accrued in connection with the 2017/2018
wildfire/mudslide events caused its equity ratio to fall below 47% on a spot basis as of december 31, 2018 , sce remains in compliance with the 48% equity ratio over the applicable 37 -month average basis. in its application, sce is seeking a limited waiver to exclude wildfire-related charges and wildfire-related debt issuances from its equity ratio calculations until a determination regarding cost recovery is made. under the cpuc's rules, sce will not be deemed to be in violation of the equity ratio requirement, and therefore may continue to issue debt and dividends, while the waiver application is pending resolution. for further information, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 1. summary of significant accounting policies-sce dividends."

edison international's earnings are prepared in accordance with gaap. management uses core earnings (losses)
internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. core earnings (losses) are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding edison international's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company's performance from period to period. core earnings (losses) are a non-gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. core earnings (losses) are defined as earnings attributable to edison international shareholders less non-core items. non-core items include income or loss from discontinued operations, income resulting from allocation of losses to tax equity investors under the hlbv accounting method (related to previous results of socore energy which was sold in the second quarter of 2018) and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as write downs, asset impairments and other gains and losses related to certain tax, regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings, and exit activities, including sale of certain assets and other activities that are no longer continuing.

edison international's 2018 earnings decreased $988 million , driven by a decrease in sce's earnings of $1,322
million , partially offset by a decrease in edison international parent and other losses of $300 million , and $34
million income from discontinued operations. sce's lower net income consisted of $1,269 million of higher non-core losses and $53 million of lower core earnings. the decrease in core earnings was due to the impact of the july 2017
cost of capital decision on grc revenue, higher operation and maintenance expenses related to wildfire insurance premiums and vegetation management and higher net financing costs, partially offset by higher income tax benefits.
edison international parent and other losses from continuing operations for 2018 consisted of $62 million of higher core losses and $362 million of lower non-core losses. the increase in core losses in 2018 was due to income tax benefits in 2017 related to stock option exercises, net operating loss carrybacks from the filing of the 2016 tax returns in 2017, the 2017 settlement of federal income tax audits for 2007 - 2012 and the impact of tax reform on pre-tax losses, partially offset by a california tax audit settlement and the absence of socore energy losses due to its sale in april 2018.
in the fourth quarter of 2018, edison international reached a settlement with the california franchise tax board for tax years 1994 - 2006. edison international and sce also updated their uncertain tax positions to reflect the settlement. certain components of the settlement related to ongoing business activity of edison international and sce and are reflected in core earnings. other components of the settlement related to legacy businesses of edison international with no ongoing operations or tax positions that are no longer indicative of edison international or sce's ongoing earnings and are reflected in discontinued operations and non-core earnings, respectively. overall, the settlement of the 1994 - 2006 california tax audits resulted in total tax benefits of $103 million at edison international ($15 million core earnings, $54 million non-core earnings and $34 million earnings from discontinued operations) and $70 million at sce ($4 million core earnings and $66 million non-core earnings).
consolidated non-core items for 2018 and 2017 for edison international included:
•  charge of $2.5 billion ($1.8 billionafter-tax) in 2018 for sce's wildfire-related claims, net of expected recoveries from insurance and ferc customers.
loss of $56 million ($46 million after-tax) in 2018 for edison international parent and other primarily related to sale of socore energy in april 2018 and income of $21 million ($13 million after-tax) in 2017

2018 general rate case sce's grc proceeding, for the three-year period 2018 - 2020, is pending. sce has requested a revenue requirement of
$5.534 billion for its test year of 2018, a $106 million decrease from the 2017 grc authorized revenue requirement, and revenue requirements for the post-test years of 2019 and 2020 of $5.965 billion and $6.468 billion, respectively.
in the absence of a 2018 grc decision, sce has recognized revenue in 2018 and is recognizing revenue in 2019 based on the 2017 authorized revenue requirement, adjusted for the july 2017 cost of capital decision and tax reform. the cpuc has approved the establishment of a grc memorandum account and the 2018 and 2019 revenue requirements adopted by the cpuc will be effective as of january 1, 2018 and january 1, 2019, respectively.
sce accounts for regulatory decisions in the discrete period in which they are received and, accordingly, will record the impact of the 2018 grc decision when a decision is received. sce cannot predict the revenue requirements the cpuc will authorize or provide assurance on the timing of a final decision.

southern california wildfires and mudslides approximately 35% of sce's service territory is in areas identified as high fire risk by sce. multiple factors have contributed to increased wildfires, faster progression of wildfires and the increased damage from wildfires across sce's service territory and throughout california. these include the buildup of dry vegetation in areas severely impacted by years of historic drought, lack of adequate clearing of hazardous fuels by responsible parties, higher temperatures, lower humidity, and strong santa ana winds. at the same time that wildfire risk has been increasing in southern california, residential and commercial development has occurred and is occurring in some of the highest-risk areas. such factors can increase the likelihood and extent of wildfires.
in december 2017 and november 2018, wind-driven wildfires impacted portions of sce's service territory, causing substantial damage to both residential and business properties and service outages for sce customers. the largest of the 2017 fires, known as the thomas fire, originated in ventura county and burned acreage located in both ventura and santa barbara counties. the largest of the 2018 fires, known as the woolsey fire, originated in ventura county and burned acreage in both ventura and los angeles counties. according to cal fire information, the thomas fire burned over 280,000 acres, destroyed an estimated 1,063 structures, damaged an estimated 280 structures and resulted in two fatalities, while the woolsey fire burned almost 100,000 acres, destroyed an estimated 1,643
structures, damaged an estimated 364 structures and resulted in three fatalities.
multiple lawsuits related to the thomas fire and the woolsey fire have been initiated against sce and edison international. some of the thomas fire-related lawsuits claim that sce and edison international have responsibility for the damages caused by the montecito mudslides based on a theory that sce has responsibility for the thomas fire and that the thomas fire proximately caused the montecito mudslides. according to santa barbara county initial reports, the montecito mudslides destroyed an estimated 135 structures, damaged an estimated 324 structures, and resulted in 21 fatalities, with two additional fatalities presumed.
investigations into the causes of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events are ongoing and final determinations of liability would only be made during lengthy and complex litigation processes. even when investigations are still pending or liability is disputed, an assessment of likely outcomes, including through future settlement of disputed claims, may require a charge to be accrued under accounting standards. based on sce's internal review into the facts and circumstances of each of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events and consideration of the risks associated with litigation, edison international and sce expect to incur a material loss in connection with the 2017/2018
wildfire/mudslide events and have accrued a charge, before recoveries and taxes, of $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. this charge corresponds to the lower end of the reasonably estimated range of expected potential losses that may be incurred in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events and is subject to change as additional information becomes available.
edison international and sce will seek to offset any actual losses realized in connection with the 2017/2018
wildfire/mudslide events with recoveries from insurance policies in place at the time of the events and, to the extent actual losses exceed insurance, through electric rates. in the fourth quarter of 2018, edison international and sce also recorded expected recoveries from insurance of $2.0 billion and expected recoveries through electric rates of $135 million , which is the ferc portion of the $4.7 billion charge it accrued. the net charge to earnings recorded was $1.8 billion after-tax. sce believes that in light of the cpuc's decision in cost recovery proceedings involving sdg&e, arising from a 2007 wildfire in sdg&e's service area, there is substantial uncertainty regarding how the cpuc will interpret and apply its prudency standard to an investor-owned utility in future wildfire cost-
recovery proceedings. accordingly, while the cpuc has not made a determination regarding sce's prudency relative to any of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, sce is unable to conclude, at this time, that uninsured cpuc-
jurisdictional wildfire-related costs are probable of recovery through electric rates.
edison international and sce continue to pursue legislative, regulatory and legal strategies to address the application of a strict liability standard to wildfire-related damages without the ability to recover resulting costs in electric rates. however, edison international and sce cannot predict whether or when there will be a comprehensive solution mitigating the significant risk faced by california investor-owned utilities related to wildfires.

permanent retirement of san onofre an ongoing cpuc oii proceeding regarding the steam generator replacement project at san onofre and the related outages and subsequent shutdown of san onofre was resolved in 2018 through the execution of the revised san onofre settlement agreement. in connection with the revised san onofre settlement agreement, and in exchange for the release of certain san onofre-related claims, sce and sdg&e entered into a utility shareholder agreement, in which sce agreed to pay sdg&e the amounts sdg&e would have received in rates under the prior san onofre settlement agreement but will not receive upon the implementation of the revised san onofre settlement agreement. in the fourth quarter of 2017, sce incurred a charge of $716 million ($448 million after-tax) to adjust regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probable approval of the revised san onofre settlement agreement and to record an accrued liability of $143 million for the estimated present value of the obligation due to sdg&e under the utility shareholder agreement.
in july 2018, the cpuc approved all of the terms of the revised san onofre settlement agreement other than a provision under which sce agreed to fund $10 million for a research, development and demonstration program intended to develop technologies and methodologies to reduce ghg emissions (the "modification"). the revised san onofre settlement agreement with the modification became effective on august 2, 2018, and sce recorded a benefit related to the modification during the third quarter of 2018.
for further information, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-permanent retirement of san onofre."
tax reform in december 2017, tax reform was signed into law. this comprehensive reform of tax law reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and is generally effective beginning january 1, 2018. certain provisions of tax reform, such as full expensing of certain capital expenditures ("bonus depreciation") and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense are not applicable to regulated utilities, such as sce. edison international expects it will be exempt from the new interest disallowance provisions under de-minimis rules issued by the irs in
2018.
gaap requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. thus, at december 31, 2017, the company's deferred taxes were re-measured based upon the new tax rate. immediately prior to the enactment of tax reform, edison international parent and other had approximately $2.6 billion of federal net operating loss carryforwards ("nol") (excluding capistrano wind net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $400 million). the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate does not change the gross dollar value of taxable income that may be offset by nols, however since future income will only be taxable at 21% the value of nols utilized after 2017 is reduced. the re-
measurement of these nols along with the other deferred taxes, resulted in a non-core charge of $433 million reflected in "income tax expense" for edison international parent and other at december 31, 2017. edison international parent and other also has $347 million of tax credit carryforwards (excluding capistrano wind tax credit carryforwards of approximately $112 million) which directly offset taxes due and are not re-measured in connection with tax reform.
the specific provisions of tax reform applicable to sce allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, eliminate bonus depreciation for property acquired after december 31, 2017, and continues rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. while the re-measurement of deferred taxes at edison international parent and other were recorded to earnings, the re-measurement of deferred taxes at sce was mainly recorded to regulatory liabilities or an offset to regulatory assets since pre-tax amounts giving rise to the deferred taxes were created through ratemaking activities. since the majority of sce's deferred taxes arise from property-related differences, sce estimates that the amount to be refunded will be amortized over approximately 40
or more years. the specifics of how and when the amounts will be returned are expected to be approved in early 2019
as both the cpuc and ferc finalize rate proceedings addressing this issue, among other things.
in the absence of regulatory guidance specific to tax reform, sce used judgment to interpret prior cpuc and ferc decisions to determine which re-measurement amounts will be refunded to customers. at december 31, 2017, the implementation of tax reform for sce resulted in a reduction of deferred tax liabilities and an increase in regulatory liabilities of approximately $5.0 billion ("excess deferred taxes"). a non-core charge of $33 million was recorded for the re-measurement of deferred taxes attributable to shareholder-funded activities in 2017 "income tax expense."
6
changes in the allocation of deferred tax re-measurement between customers and shareholders will be reflected in the financial statements and adjusted prospectively as information becomes available. the cpuc issued a resolution in february 2019 holding that customers are only entitled to excess deferred taxes that were included when setting rates, and that all other deferred tax re-measurement belongs to shareholders. as a result of the resolution, sce will record a non-core income tax benefit of approximately $70 million in the first quarter of 2019.
in the near term, tax reform will lower rates charged to customers, but will not have a meaningful impact to sce's earnings. certain deferred tax liabilities reduce sce's rate base. the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities from the implementation of tax reform will not impact sce's rate base initially. however, tax reform's elimination of bonus depreciation and lower corporate tax rates will reduce cash flow from operations and increase rate base over time. in addition, as new plant is placed in service the lower federal corporate tax rate will result in lower deferred tax liabilities and, therefore, higher rate base. see "-capital program." to the extent that edison international parent and other continue to produce pre-tax losses, tax reform will result in lower tax benefits.
tax reform will also impact edison international's liquidity. see "liquidity and capital resources-edison international parent and other-net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards."
electricity industry trends in addition to responding to the "new normal" of increased wildfire-activity in california, the electric power industry is also undergoing transformative change driven by technological advances, such as customer-owned generation, electric vehicles and energy storage, which is altering the nature of energy generation and delivery.
california is committed to reducing its ghg emissions, improving local air quality and supporting continued economic growth. the state set goals to reduce ghg emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030 and 80 percent from the same baseline by 2050. state and local air quality plans call for substantial improvements, such as reducing smog-causing nitrogen oxides 90 percent below 2010 levels by 2032 in the most polluted areas of the state.
while these policy goals cannot be achieved by the electric sector alone, the electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that support california's climate change and ghg reduction objectives.
the grid is also key to enabling more customer choices with respect to new energy technologies, including fostering the adoption of electric vehicles.
edison international expects to lead the transformation of the industry by building a modernized and more reliable grid, focusing on opportunities in clean energy and efficient electrification, and enabling customers' technology choices.
sce plans to enable the adoption of new energy technologies that mitigate wildfire risk and benefit customers of the electric grid while also helping california achieve its environmental goals. sce expects to achieve these objectives through improving the safety and reliability of the transmission and distribution network and helping customers make cleaner energy choices including enabling increased penetration of ders, electric transportation and energy efficiency programs. sce's ongoing focus to drive operational and service excellence is intended to allow it to achieve these objectives safely while controlling costs and customer rates. sce's focus on the transmission and distribution of electricity aligns with california's policy supporting competitive power procurement markets. for more information on the grid development, see "-capital program-grid development" below.
changes in the electric power industry are impacting customers and jurisdictions outside california as well. edison international believes that other states will also pursue climate change and ghg reduction objectives and large commercial and industrial customers will continue to pursue cost reduction and sustainability goals. edison energy provides energy services and managed portfolio solutions to commercial and industrial customers who may be impacted by these changes. edison energy seeks to provide advice in dealing with increasingly complex tariff and technology choices in order to support customers and their management of energy costs and risks.
to provide a broader view of developments outside of sce, edison international has made several minority investments in emerging companies in areas related to the technology changes that are driving industry transformation, and may make additional investments in the future. these investments are not financially material to edison international.

capital program total capital expenditures (including accruals), were $4.4 billion in 2018 and $3.8 billion in 2017. sce's year-end rate base was $29.6 billion at december 31, 2018 compared to $27.8 billion at december 31, 2017.
in the absence of a 2018 grc decision, sce has developed and is executing against a 2019 capital plan that will allow it to manage capital spending over the three year grc period to meet what is ultimately authorized while minimizing the risk of unauthorized spending. a component of this approach is to focus initial grid modernization spending on capital that provides safety and reliability benefits while deferring most spending that is primarily focused on integration of ders. the 2019 capital plan also includes spending associated with sce's gs&rp and 2019
wmp which are incremental to amounts requested in the 2018 grc. in september 2018, sce filed an application with the cpuc requesting approval of a gs&rp to implement additional wildfire safety measures and in january 2019, the cpuc authorized the establishment of an interim memorandum account to track incremental gs&rp expenditures. in february 2019, sce filed its 2019 wmp with the cpuc.
the table below reflects capital expenditures for 2019 based on planned cpuc jurisdictional spending, including
$346 million of gs&rp- and wmp- related capital expenditures, and capital expenditures for 2020 based on amounts requested in the 2018 grc. cpuc jurisdictional capital expenditures related to the gs&rp will be incorporated into the 2020 capital forecast after the receipt of the 2018 grc decision, as part of the capital execution planning process. given the significance of wildfire-related risks and the need for skilled resources to complete activities, sce may reallocate spending authorized in the 2018 grc to maximize the wildfire mitigation efforts.
ferc jurisdictional capital expenditures are based on management's expectations. forecasted expenditures for ferc capital projects are subject to change due to timeliness of permitting, licensing, regulatory approvals, and contractor bids. capital spending in 2019 and 2020 will be dependent upon the amount approved in a final 2018 grc decision. for further information, see "-grid development" below.
the cpuc has approved 81%, 89%, and 92% of the traditional capital expenditures requested in the 2009, 2012, and
2015 grc decisions, respectively. while sce cannot predict the level of traditional capital spending that will be approved in the 2018 grc decision, management is not aware of factors that would cause the percentage of sce's request that is approved to be materially different from what has been approved in recent grc decisions. sce does not have prior approval experience with grid modernization capital expenditures and, therefore, is unable to predict an expected outcome. forecasted expenditures for capital projects are subject to change due to, among other things, timeliness of permitting, licensing, regulatory approvals, and contractor bids. for further information regarding the capital program, see "liquidity and capital resources-sce-capital investment plan."

grid development medium- and heavy-duty vehicle transportation electrification in january 2017, sce filed an application with the cpuc requesting approval of transportation electrification programs to accelerate the adoption of electric transportation, which is critical to california's climate change and ghg reduction objectives. the application proposed a five-year program to fund medium- and heavy-duty vehicle charging infrastructure that follows the model developed for sce's charge ready program, as well as six pilot projects to be considered on an accelerated basis. in january 2018, the cpuc issued a final decision approving five pilot projects with a budget of $16 million ($10 million capital) in 2016 dollars. in may 2018, the cpuc issued a final decision approving the five-year program, with certain modifications, to install charging infrastructure to support the electrification of 8,490 medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles at 870 sites, which must be fully contracted for by 2024. the final decision includes an approved five-year budget of $356 million ($242 million capital) in nominal dollars. sce expects to propose additional programs and pilots in the future.
grid safety and resiliency program in september 2018, sce filed an application with the cpuc requesting approval of a gs&rp to implement additional wildfire safety measures, including measures to further harden sce's infrastructure to significantly reduce potential fire ignition sources, bolster sce's situational awareness capabilities to more fully assess and respond to potential wildfire conditions, and enhance sce's operational practices to further strengthen fire safety measures and system resiliency. in its gs&rp application, sce proposed to spend approximately $582 million ($407
million capital) in 2018 dollars between 2018 and 2020. the amounts requested for the 2018 to 2020 period are not included in sce's 2018 grc. in january 2019, the cpuc approved the establishment of an interim memorandum account to track gs&rp costs while the cpuc considers sce's request for a balancing account, however there is no assurance that sce will be allowed to ultimately recover these costs. the cpuc also imposed a monthly reporting requirement to enable monitoring of sce's gs&rp spending. gs&rp capital expenditures for 2018 were $54 million and forecasted gs&rp capital expenditures for 2019 are $224 million. if sce's proposed balancing account is approved, forecasted costs for gs&rp will be included in rates, with a subsequent reasonableness review through the annual erra proceeding.
wildfire mitigation plan in february 2019, sce filed its 2019 wmp with the cpuc. the wmp describes strategies, programs and activities that are in place, being implemented or are under development by sce to proactively address and mitigate the threat of electrical infrastructure-associated ignitions that could lead to wildfires. many, but not all, of the programs and activities described in the 2019 wmp are part of sce's 2018 grc request or gs&rp application. upon approval, sce will establish a memorandum account to track incremental costs incurred to implement the wmp. the planned 2019 wmp spending not contemplated in the 2018 grc and gs&rp proceedings is approximately $380 million of which $122 million is capital. sce will track costs and seek recovery in future cpuc procedural forums for any incremental costs beyond those which are ultimately approved in the 2018 grc decision and the gs&rp proceeding.
charge ready program in january 2016, the cpuc approved sce's $22 million charge ready program pilot, which allows sce to install light-
duty electric vehicle charging infrastructure, provide rebates to offset the cost of qualified customer-owned charging stations, and
9
implement a supporting marketing, education, and outreach campaign. as of december 31, 2018, sce had executed agreements and reserved funding for 79 sites to deploy 1,280 charge ports. the results of this pilot helped shape charge ready 2, the second phase of the charge ready program.
in june 2018, sce filed an application to obtain approval for charge ready 2. in the application, sce requested approval for $760 million ($561 million capital) in 2018 dollars to install infrastructure and provide rebates to support 48,000 new electric vehicle charging ports as part of a four-year program that will also include a marketing, education, and outreach campaign. in december 2018, the cpuc approved bridge funding to continue the charge ready program pilot until charge ready 2 is ultimately approved. sce's 2019 capital plan contemplates $13
million of bridge charge ready program pilot spending. sce is unable to estimate the amount of capital that will be approved, or the timing of any such approval, in connection with charge ready 2.
distribution resources plan in july 2015, sce filed its drp with the cpuc. the filing was made as part of a cpuc proceeding initiated to support california's climate change and ghg reduction targets, modernize the electric distribution system to accommodate two-way flows of energy associated with ders, such as rooftop solar, and facilitate customer choice of new technologies and services that reduce emissions and improve resilience. sce's drp included an indicative forecast of capital investment in distribution automation, substation automation, communications systems, technology platforms and applications, and grid reinforcement. sce's 2018 grc includes operation and maintenance and capital expenditure requests consistent with sce's drp operation and maintenance and capital spending. capital investments may be updated or revised based on developments and guidance received from the cpuc as a part of the
2018 grc, drp rule making, technology availability, pace of der adoption, and other factors. in february 2018, the cpuc issued a decision that established a new distribution investment deferral framework and provided new guidance regarding der adoption forecasting. in march 2018, the cpuc approved a decision that provides a grid modernization framework that will be used to support cpuc review of grid modernization investments that are proposed in a grc.
this grid modernization framework will not apply to sce's 2018 grc, unless otherwise ordered by the alj or assigned commissioner in the 2018 grc. it will apply to subsequent grcs.
results of operations sce sce's results of operations are derived mainly through two sources:
earning activities - representing revenue authorized by the cpuc and ferc which is intended to provide sce a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its net investment in generation,
•  transmission and distribution assets. the annual revenue requirements are comprised of authorized operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, taxes and a return consistent with the capital structure. also, included in earnings activities are revenue or penalties related to incentive mechanisms, other operating revenue, and regulatory charges or disallowances.
cost-recovery activities - representing cpuc- and ferc-authorized balancing accounts which allow for recovery of specific project or program costs, subject to reasonableness review or compliance with upfront
•  standards. cost-recovery activities include rates which provide recovery, subject to reasonableness review of, among other things, fuel costs, purchased power costs, public purpose related-program costs (including energy efficiency and demand-side management programs) and certain operation and maintenance expenses. sce earns no return on these activities.

earning activities
2018 vs 2017
earning activities were primarily affected by the following:
•  lower operating revenue of $51 million is primarily due to:
a decrease of $164 million in cpuc revenue primarily from recognizing 2018 revenue based on the 2017
authorized revenue requirement, adjusted for the july 2017 cost of capital decision and the impact of tax
•  reform, partially offset by the receipt of a $17 million reimbursement related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs recorded in 2018 and a $15 million refund to customers for prior overcollections of revenue recorded in 2017. see "management overview-
11
2018 general rate case" and "notes to consolidated financial statements-note12. commitments and contingencies-spent nuclear fuel" for further information.
an increase in ferc revenue of $44 million primarily due to $135 million of expected recoveries from
•  customers for the ferc portion of wildfire-related claims, partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate resulting from tax reform.
a decrease in revenue related to san onofre of $223 million primarily related to the recovery of amortization of the san onofre regulatory asset in 2017 (offset in depreciation and amortization) and
•  authorized return as provided by the prior san onofre settlement agreement. as a result of the revised san onofre settlement agreement, there was no revenue recorded in 2018 for san onofre other than the previously disallowed costs. see "management overview-permanent retirement of san onofre" for further information.
an increase in revenue of $338 million related to tax balancing account activities (offset in income taxes
•  below), consisting of $216 million of lower customer refunds for incremental tax repair benefits and $122
million for tax benefits related to 2017 tax accounting method changes.
•  a decrease of $75 million resulting from the amortization of excess deferred tax assets as a result of tax reform.
higher operation and maintenance expense of $74 million primarily due to higher wildfire insurance premiums
•  and vegetation management costs (see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides-current wildfire insurance coverage"
for further information).
•  charge of $2.7 billion recorded in 2018 for wildfire-related claims, net of expected insurance recoveries.
•  lower depreciation and amortization expense of $165 million primarily related to the amortization of the san onofre regulatory asset in 2017 (offset in revenue above).
•  higher property and other taxes of $20 million primarily due to higher property assessed values in 2018.
lower impairment and other of $728 million primarily related to charges recorded in 2017 due to the revised
•  san onofre settlement agreement. see "management overview-permanent retirement of san onofre" for further information.
•  higher interest expense of $83 million primarily due to increased borrowings and higher interest on balancing account overcollections in 2018.
•  higher other income and expenses of $14 million primarily due to higher afudc equity income. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 15. other income and expenses" for further information.
•  lower income taxes of $666 million primarily due to the following:
higher non-core income tax benefits of $540 million due to 2018 tax benefits of $709 million related to the charge for wildfire-related claims, $66 million related to the settlement of the 1994 - 2006 california tax
•  audits and $33 million of 2017 tax expense related to the re-measurement of deferred taxes resulting from the implementation of tax reform, partially offset by tax benefits of $268 million recorded in 2017 due to charges related to the revised san onofre settlement agreement.
the impact of a lower federal income tax rate on pre-tax income and a true-up related to the filing of the
•  federal income tax return of $208 million, partially offset by lower income tax benefits of $184 million due to the tax balancing account activities referred to above and the impact of tax reform on those activities.
•  lower pre-tax income in 2018, excluding non-core items discussed above.
2017 vs 2016
earning activities were primarily affected by the following:
•  higher operating revenue of $107 million is primarily due to:
an increase in revenue of approximately $241 million related to the increase in authorized revenue from the
•  escalation mechanism set forth in the 2015 grc decision and $32 million of higher operating costs subject to balancing account treatment (primarily offset in depreciation expense below). these increases were partially offset by $33 million of
12
lower revenue related to the extension of bonus depreciation and a $15 million revenue reduction for the expected refund to customers of prior overcollections identified in 2017.
energy efficiency incentive awards recognized in 2017 were $17 million compared to $5 million in 2016.
•  during 2016, the cpuc approved a settlement agreement in which sce agreed to refund $13 million related to incentive awards sce received for savings achieved by its 2006 - 2008 energy efficiency programs.
a decrease in revenue of $118 million related to tax benefits refunded to customers (offset in income taxes below). the decrease in revenue resulted from $116 million of higher year-over-year incremental tax repair
•  benefits recognized and $135 million of benefits recognized for tax accounting method changes. these decreases were partially offset by a 2016 revenue refund to customers of $133 million related to 2012 - 2014
incremental tax repair deductions.
a decrease in ferc-related revenue of $39 million primarily related to higher operating costs in 2016
•  including amortization of the regulatory asset associated with the coolwater-lugo transmission project and a
$8 million reduction to ferc revenue due to a change in estimate under the ferc formula rate mechanism.
•  an increase of $20 million for other operating revenue resulting from refunds to customers recorded in 2016
due to the retroactive extension of bonus depreciation in the path act of 2015.
lower operation and maintenance expense of $36 million primarily due to the impact of sce's operational and
•  service excellence initiatives and lower legal costs, partially offset by higher transmission and distribution costs for line clearing and maintenance and information technology costs.
higher depreciation and amortization expense of $34 million primarily related to depreciation and
•  amortization on transmission and distribution investments, partially offset by amortization of the regulatory asset related to coolwater-lugo plant recorded in 2016.
•  higher property and other taxes of $21 million primarily due to higher property assessed values in 2017.
•  impairment charge of $716 million in 2017 due to the revised san onofre settlement agreement (see
"management overview-highlights of operating results" for further information).
•  higher other operating income of $8 million due to the sale of utility property.
•  higher interest expense of $48 million primarily due to increased borrowings and higher interest on balancing account overcollections in 2017.
•  higher other income and expenses of $19 million primarily due to higher afudc equity income. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 15. other income and expenses" for further information.
•  lower income taxes of $286 million primarily due to the following:
higher non-core income tax benefits in 2017 of $235 million due to the impairment and other charges related
•  to the revised san onofre settlement agreement, partially offset by $33 million income tax expense related to the re-measurement of deferred taxes resulting from the implementation of tax reform.
higher income tax benefits in 2017 of $70 million due to $149 million related to flow through of incremental
•  tax repair benefits and for tax accounting method changes (offset in revenue above), partially offset by $79
million flow-through of 2012 - 2014 incremental income tax benefits in 2016.
•  higher pre-tax income in 2017, excluding non-core items discussed above.
cost-recovery activities
2018 vs 2017
cost-recovery activities were primarily affected by the following:
higher purchased power and fuel costs of $533 million primarily driven by higher power and gas prices and
•  volume experienced in 2018 relative to 2017, partially offset by higher congestion revenue right credits, lower capacity costs, proceeds from contract amendments and the receipt of funds in 2018 from counterparties related to the california energy crisis.
13
lower operation and maintenance expense subject to balancing accounts of $94 million primarily driven by
•  reduced spending on energy efficiency programs and the timing of revenue recognition associated with costs tracked through memorandum accounts, partially offset by higher transmission access charges.
higher other income and expenses of $32 million primarily driven by higher net periodic benefit income
•  related to the non-service cost components in 2018 relative to 2017. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 9. compensation and benefit plans" for further information.
2017 vs 2016
higher purchased power and fuel costs of $346 million primarily driven by higher power and gas prices
•  experienced in 2017 relative to 2016, partially offset by lower realized losses on hedging activities ($14
million in 2017 compared to $59 million in 2016) and lower capacity costs.
lower operation and maintenance expense of $14 million primarily driven by lower employee benefit and other
•  labor costs and lower spending on various public purpose programs, partially offset by an increase in transmission and distribution costs for line clearing and maintenance activities.
higher other income and expenses of $15 million primarily driven by higher net periodic benefit income
•  related to the non-service cost components in 2017 relative to 2016. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 9. compensation and benefit plans" for further information.
supplemental operating revenue information sce's retail billed and unbilled revenue (excluding wholesale sales) was $11.7 billion, $11.4 billion and $10.9
billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the 2018 revenue increase is primarily related to higher purchased power and fuel costs driven by higher power and gas prices and volume experienced in 2018 relative to 2017, partially offset by higher congestion revenue right credits and lower revenue for san onofre resulting from the revised san onofre settlement agreement. see "-cost-
recovery activities" and "-earnings activities" for further details.
the 2017 revenue reflects an increase primarily due to the implementation of the 2017 erra rate increase.
as a result of the cpuc-authorized decoupling mechanism, sce earnings are not affected by changes in retail electricity sales (see "business-sce-overview of ratemaking process").
income taxes sce's income tax provision decreased by $666 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased by $286 million in 2017
compared to 2016 . the effective tax rates were (78.6)% , (2.7)% and 14.6% for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
sce's effective tax rate is below the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 and 35% for 2017 and 2016 primarily due to cpuc's ratemaking treatment for the current tax benefit arising from certain property-related and other temporary differences, which reverse over time. the accounting treatment for these temporary differences results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to deferred income tax expense. the effective tax rate decrease in 2018 was due to the settlement of the 1994 - 2006 california tax audits, the impact of tax reform and incremental tax benefits related to repair deductions, coupled with the large pre-tax loss created by the charge of $2.5 billion for wildfire-related claims, net of recoveries from insurance and customers. the effective tax rate decrease in 2017 was primarily due to an impairment charge of $716 million related to the revised san onofre settlement agreement. the decrease was also attributable to higher incremental repair tax benefits and benefits recognized for tax accounting method changes, all of which will be refunded to customers, partially offset by lower tax benefits related to a $133 million revenue refund to customers that was recorded in 2016.
see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 8. income taxes" for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective income tax rates and "management overview-permanent retirement of san onofre" above for more information.

related to the settlement of the 1994 - 2006 california tax audits, offset by a reduction in uncertain tax positions that resulted from this settlement.
increase in losses of $44 million due to the impact from the april 2018 sale of socore energy, partially offset by a goodwill impairment recorded in 2017 on the socore energy reporting unit. the higher losses
•  included lower hlbv income, partially offset by a reduction in losses due to the exit of this business activity in 2018. in addition, edison energy group's 2018 results included a $13 million after-tax goodwill impairment charge on the edison energy reporting unit.
the loss from continuing operations of edison international parent and other increased $370 million in 2017
compared to 2016 primarily due to:
•  income tax expense of $433 million in 2017 from the re-measurement of deferred taxes as a result of tax reform.

liquidity and capital resources sce sce's ability to operate its business, fund capital expenditures, and implement its business strategy is dependent upon its cash flow and access to the bank and capital markets. sce's overall cash flows fluctuate based on, among other things, its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates, changes in commodity prices and volumes, collateral requirements, interest obligations, dividend payments to edison international and preferred and preference shareholders, and the outcome of tax and regulatory matters.
as discussed in "management overview," tax reform is expected to lower rates charged to customers which will result in less cash available to fund operations. in the next 12 months, sce expects to fund its cash requirements through operating cash flows and capital market financings, as needed. sce also has availability under its credit facilities to fund cash requirements.
sce's long-term issuer credit ratings remain at investment grade levels after downgrade actions taken by the major credit agencies in 2018 and early 2019. the following table summarizes sce's current, long-term issuer credit ratings and outlook from the major credit rating agencies:
moody's                     fitch     s&p credit rating    a3                          bbb+      bbb outlook          under review for downgrade  negative  watch negative sce's credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of pending enforcement and litigation matters, including the outcome of the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with the 2017/2018
wildfire/mudslide events, and the reform of policies allocating liability to investor-owned utilities for damages caused by catastrophic wildfires substantially caused by utility equipment. credit rating downgrades increase the cost and may impact the availability of short-term and long-term borrowings, including commercial paper, credit facilities, bond financings or other borrowings. in addition, some of sce's power procurement contracts require sce to pay related liabilities or post additional collateral if sce's credit rating were to fall below investment grade rating from the major credit rating agencies. incremental collateral requirements for power procurement contracts resulting from a potential downgrade of sce's credit rating to below investment grade is $22 million as of december
31, 2018. in addition, if sce's credit rating falls below investment grade, it may be required to post up to $50
million in collateral, in connection with its environmental remediation obligations, within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year in which the downgrade occurs. for further details, see "-margin and collateral deposits."
available liquidity in may 2018, sce amended its multi-year revolving credit facility to increase the facility from $2.75 billion to
$3.0 billion .
at december 31, 2018 , sce had $2.1 billion available under its $3.0 billion credit facility. the credit facility is available for borrowing needs until may 2023, and contains two 1-year extension options. in february 2019, sce issued a $750 million term loan and the proceeds of the loan were used to repay sce's commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. for further details, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 5.
debt and credit agreements."
sce may finance balancing account undercollections and working capital requirements to support operations and capital expenditures with commercial paper, its credit facility or other borrowings, subject to availability in the bank and capital markets. as necessary, sce will utilize its available liquidity, capital market financings, other borrowings or parent company contributions to sce equity in order to meet its obligations as they become due, including any potential costs related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events (see "management overview-southern california wildfires and mudslides" for further information).
debt covenant the debt covenant in sce's credit facility limits its debt to total capitalization ratio to less than or equal to
0.65 to 1. at december 31, 2018 , sce's debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.50 to 1.
at december 31, 2018 , sce was in compliance with all financial covenants that affect access to capital.

west of devers the west of devers project consists of upgrading and reconfiguring approximately 48 miles of existing 220 kv transmission lines between the devers, el casco, vista and san bernardino substations, increasing the power transfer capabilities in support of california's renewable portfolio standards goals.
in august 2016, the cpuc approved the construction of the west of devers project. as a result of the delay in receipt of the project's approval from the cpuc, sce deferred the forecasted timing of project capital expenditures. pao filed an application for rehearing in september 2016 stating that the august 2016 decision failed to follow the california environmental quality act when it approved the project and should have approved an alternative project with an amended scope. in march 2017, the cpuc issued a decision denying pao's september 2016
application for rehearing and confirmed sce's proposed project. during 2018, sce started construction on the 220kv transmission line and expects to complete construction by 2021.
mesa substation the mesa substation project consists of replacing the existing 220 kv mesa substation with a new 500/220 kv substation. the mesa substation project would address reliability concerns by providing additional transmission import capability, allowing greater flexibility in the siting of new generation, and reducing the total amount of new generation required to meet local reliability needs in the western los angeles basin area. in february 2017, the cpuc issued a final decision approving the project largely consistent with sce's proposal and rejected alternative project configurations proposed by cpuc staff. in october 2017, sce awarded the competitive bid for the new 220kv portion of substation construction. sce updated the expected cost of the project due to schedule delays and scope changes. the remainder (500kv portion of substation construction) will be put out for bid by early 2019
and sce expects that costs associated with the project may change as a result of the competitive bidding process.
alberhill system the alberhill system project would consist of constructing a new 500-kv substation, two 500-kv transmission lines to connect the proposed substation to the existing serrano-valley 500-kv transmission line, telecommunication equipment and subtransmission lines in unincorporated and incorporated portions of western riverside county. the project was designed to meet long-term forecasted electrical demand in the proposed alberhill system project area and to increase electrical system reliability. in april 2018 and july 2018, the cpuc issued a proposed decision and an alternate proposed decision, both denying sce's ability to construct the alberhill system project based on a perceived lack of need. sce filed comments on both proposed decisions requesting that the cpuc grant the certificate of public convenience and necessity for the alberhill system project. in august 2018, the cpuc directed sce to submit supplemental information on the alberhill system project including details of demand and load forecasts and possible alternatives to the proposed project. ongoing capital spending has been deferred as a result of the cpuc request for additional information and alternatives.
given the uncertainty
17
associated with the resolution of the permitting process, potential revisions to the project have not been reflected in total direct expenditures. sce continues to believe the alberhill system project is needed and is unable to predict the timing of a final cpuc decision in connection with the alberhill system project.
approximately 48% of the alberhill system project costs spent to date would be subject to recovery through cpuc revenue and 52% through ferc revenue. in october 2017, sce obtained approval from the ferc for abandoned plant treatment for the alberhill system project, which allows sce to seek recovery of 100% of all prudently-incurred costs after the approval date and 50% of prudently incurred costs prior to the approval date. excluding land costs, which may be recovered through sale to a third party, sce has incurred approximately $42 million of capital expenditures, including overhead costs, as of december 31, 2018, of which approximately $31 million may not be recoverable if the project is cancelled.
riverside transmission reliability the riverside transmission reliability project is a joint project between sce and riverside public utilities (rpu), the municipal utility department of the city of riverside. while rpu would be responsible for constructing some of the project's facilities within riverside, sce's portion of the project consists of constructing upgrades to its system, including a new 230-kv substation; certain interconnection and telecommunication facilities and transmission lines in the cities of riverside, jurupa valley and norco and in portions of unincorporated riverside county. the purpose of the project is to provide rpu and its customers with adequate transmission capacity to serve existing and projected load, to provide for long-term system capacity for load growth, and to provide needed system reliability. due to changed circumstances since the time the project was originally developed, sce informed the cpuc in august 2016 that it supports revisions to the proposed project. in april 2018, the cpuc issued a subsequent environmental impact report which included a new route alternative, different from sce's proposed project, as the environmentally preferred project and proposed an additional underground section of the proposed 220-kv power line.
in october 2018, the cpuc issued the final environmental report confirming the cpuc's new route alternative and additional underground section as the environmentally preferred project. sce is assessing costs for its proposed project as well as new cost estimates for the alternatives included in the final environmental report. sce anticipates a final cpuc decision on a certificate of public convenience and necessity in the first quarter of
2020.
eldorado-lugo-mohave upgrade the eldorado-lugo-mohave upgrade project will increase capacity on existing transmission lines to allow additional renewable energy to flow from nevada to southern california. the project would modify sce's existing eldorado, lugo, and mohave electrical substations to accommodate the increased current flow from nevada to southern california; increase the power flow through the existing 500 kv transmission lines by constructing two new capacitors along the lines; raise transmission tower heights to meet ground clearance requirements; and install communication wire on our transmission lines to allow for communication between existing sce substations. sce has proposed an expedited schedule and a non-standard review process with the regulatory permitting agencies in order to meet the current in-service date. during september 2017, sce awarded the competitive bid for the project which resulted in a decrease to the expected capital forecast for the project. in january 2019, the cpuc directed sce to file an amended application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity. sce is currently assessing the impact of this decision on the timing and cost of the project.
regulatory proceedings cost of capital in july 2017, the cpuc adopted a petition previously filed by sce, pg&e, sdg&e, and socalgas (collectively, the
"investor-owned utilities"), pao, and turn to modify the prior cpuc decisions addressing the investor-owned utilities' costs of capital. the decision reset sce's authorized cost of long-term debt to 4.98% and preferred stock to 5.82% and established sce's authorized roe at 10.30%, both effective as of january 1, 2018. the decision also extended the deadline for the next investor-owned utilities cost of capital application to april 2019.
ferc formula rate in june 2018, sce provided its preliminary 2019 annual transmission revenue requirement update to interested parties. the update provided support for a decrease in sce's transmission revenue requirement of $131 million, or
11% from amounts currently authorized in rates, subject to settlement procedures and refund. the decrease is primarily due to lowering the federal tax rate as a result of tax reform. sce filed its 2019 annual update with the ferc on november 29, 2018 with the proposed rates effective january 1, 2019, subject to settlement procedures and refund.
18
in march 2019, sce expects to file a new formula rate with ferc. once the new formula rate is accepted by ferc, it will supersede the existing formula rate, including the 2019 annual update, and could become effective as early as
60 days from the filing date. ferc has the authority to, and may, suspend new rates for up to five months. if the new formula rate is suspended by ferc, the 2019 transmission revenue requirement rate established in the 2019
annual update will continue to be effective, subject to refund, from january 1, 2019 until the end of the suspension of the new formula rate. the new formula rate would likely be subject to refund from the end of the suspension until it is ultimately approved by ferc.
energy efficiency incentive mechanism sce has requested an award of approximately $11 million in incentives for activities in program years 2016 and
2017. sce anticipates that the cpuc will consider sce's requested award during the first or second quarter of 2019.
decommissioning of san onofre the decommissioning of a nuclear plant requires the management of three related activities: radiological decommissioning, non-radiological decommissioning and the management of spent nuclear fuel. sce has engaged a decommissioning general contractor to undertake a significant scope of decommissioning activities for units 1, 2
and 3 at san onofre. the decommissioning of san onofre is expected to take many years.
decommissioning of san onofre unit 1 began in 1999 and the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from unit 1 to dry cask storage in the independent spent fuel storage installation ("isfsi") was completed in 2005. major decommissioning work for unit 1 has been completed except for reactor vessel disposal and certain underground work. some spent nuclear fuel from units 2 and 3 also was transferred to the isfsi between 2007 and 2012. the initial activity phase of radiological decommissioning of san onofre units 2 and 3 began in june 2013 with sce filing a certification of permanent cessation of power operations at san onofre with the nrc. the transfer of the remaining spent nuclear fuel from units 2 and 3 to the isfsi began in 2018. however, the spent fuel transfer operations were suspended on august 3, 2018 due to an incident that occurred when an sce contractor was loading a spent fuel canister into the isfsi. the incident did not result in any harm to the public or workers and the canister was subsequently safely loaded into the isfsi. sce cannot predict when fuel transfer operations at san onofre will recommence. sce is in the process of obtaining the environmental permits required to start major radiological decommissioning activities at san onofre units 2 and 3. sce cannot predict when all of the necessary permits will be obtained.
in december 2018, sce updated its decommissioning cost estimate for decommissioning activities to be completed at san onofre units 2 and 3 to $3.4 billion (sce share is $2.5 billion) in 2017 dollars. the decommissioning cost estimate includes costs through the respective expected decommissioning completion dates, currently estimated to be in 2051 for san onofre units 2 and 3. the decommissioning cost estimate is subject to a number of uncertainties including the cost of disposal of nuclear waste, cost of removal of property, site remediation costs as well as a number of other assumptions and estimates, including when the federal government will provide for either interim or permanent off-site storage of spent nuclear fuel enabling the removal and transport of spent fuel canisters from the san onofre site, as to which there can be no assurance. the cost estimate is subject to change as decommissioning proceeds, and such changes may be material. the cpuc will conduct a reasonableness review for costs for each year. sce's share of the san onofre decommissioning costs recorded during 2018 were $140 million.
sce had nuclear decommissioning trust funds for san onofre units 2 and 3 of $2.6 billion as of december 31, 2018.
based upon the resolution of a number of uncertainties, including the cost and timing of nuclear waste disposal, the time it will take to obtain required permits, cost of removal of property, site remediation costs, the financial performance of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, as well as the resolution of a number of other assumptions and estimates, additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds may be required. in the event that additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds become necessary, sce will seek recovery of such additional funds through electric rates and any such recovery will be subject to a reasonableness review by the cpuc. cost increases resulting from contractual disputes or significant permitting delays, among other things, could cause sce to materially overrun the decommissioning cost estimate and could materially impact the sufficiency of trust funds.

sce dividends cpuc holding company rules require that sce's dividend policy be established by sce's board of directors on the same basis as if sce were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of sce, as deemed to be necessary to meet sce's electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the boards of directors of both edison international and sce. in addition, the cpuc regulates sce's capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay to its shareholders. under sce's interpretation of cpuc regulations, the common equity component of sce's capital structure must remain at or above 48% on a weighted average basis over the 37-month period that sce's capital structure is in effect for ratemaking purposes. as allowed under the revised san onofre settlement agreement, which was approved by the cpuc in july 2018, sce has excluded a $448 million after-tax charge resulting from the implementation of the revised san onofre settlement agreement from its ratemaking capital structure (see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-permanent retirement of san onofre" for further information on the revised san onofre settlement agreement). at december 31, 2018 , sce's 37-month average common equity component of total capitalization was 49.7% and the maximum additional dividend that sce could pay to edison international under this limitation after paying preferred and preference shareholders was $459 million , resulting in a restriction on net assets of approximately $13.3 billion .
under sce's interpretation of the cpuc's capital structure decisions, sce is required to file an application for a waiver of the 48% equity ratio condition discussed above if an adverse financial event reduces its spot equity ratio below 47%. on february 28, 2019, sce is submitting an application to the cpuc for waiver of compliance with this equity ratio requirement, describing that while the charge accrued in connection with the 2017/2018
wildfire/mudslide events caused its equity ratio to fall below 47% on a spot basis as of december 31, 2018 , sce remains in compliance with the 48% equity ratio over the applicable 37-month average basis. in its application, sce is seeking a limited waiver to exclude wildfire-related charges and wildfire-related debt issuances from its equity ratio calculations until a determination regarding cost recovery is made. under the cpuc's rules, sce will not be deemed to be in violation of the equity ratio requirement, and therefore may continue to issue debt and dividends, while the waiver application is pending resolution. for further information, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides."
as a california corporation, sce's ability to pay dividends is also governed by its obligations under the california general corporation law. california law requires that for a dividend to be declared: (a) retained earnings must equal or exceed the proposed dividend, or (b) immediately after the dividend is made, the value of the corporation's assets must exceed the value of its liabilities plus amounts required to be paid in order to liquidate stock senior to the shares receiving the dividend. additionally, a california corporation may not declare a dividend if it is, or as a result of the dividend, would be, likely to be unable to meet its liabilities as they mature. prior to declaring dividends, sce's board of directors evaluates available information, including when applicable, information pertaining to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, to ensure that the california law requirements for the declarations are met. on february 28, 2019, sce declared a dividend to edison international of
$200 million.
the timing and amount of future dividends are also dependent on a number of other factors including sce's requirements to fund other obligations and capital expenditures, and its ability to access the capital markets, and generate operating cash flows and earnings. if sce incurs significant costs related to the 2017/2018
wildfire/mudslide events and is unable to recover such costs through insurance or electric rates or access capital markets on reasonable terms, sce may be limited in its ability to pay future dividends to edison international and to its preferred and preference shareholders.

margin and collateral deposits certain derivative instruments, power procurement contracts and other contractual arrangements contain collateral requirements. in addition, certain environmental remediation obligations require financial assurance that may be in the form of collateral postings. future collateral requirements may differ from the requirements at december 31,
2018 due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements, if any, the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on sce's contractual obligations, and the impact of sce's credit ratings falling below investment grade.
the table below provides the amount of collateral posted by sce to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would have been required as of december 31, 2018 .

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
regulatory balancing accounts sce's cash flows are affected by regulatory balancing accounts overcollections or undercollections. overcollections and undercollections represent differences between cash collected in current rates for specified forecasted costs and the costs actually incurred. with some exceptions, sce seeks to adjust rates on an annual basis or at other designated times to recover or refund the balances recorded in its balancing accounts. undercollections or overcollections in these balancing accounts impact cash flows and can change rapidly. undercollections and overcollections accrue interest based on a three-month commercial paper rate published by the federal reserve.
as of december 31, 2018 , sce had regulatory balancing account net overcollections of $1.3 billion , primarily consisting of overcollections related to public purpose-related and energy efficiency program costs and brrba.
overcollections related to public purpose-related programs may decrease as costs are incurred to fund programs established by the cpuc. overcollections related to brrba are expected to decrease as refunds are provided to customers in 2019. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 11. regulatory assets and liabilities" for further information.
edison international parent and other in the next 12 months, edison international expects to fund its net cash requirements through bank and capital market financings, as needed. edison international also has availability under its credit facilities to fund cash requirements. in december 2018, edison international declared a $0.03 increase to the annual dividend rate from
$2.42 per share to $2.45 per share. on february 28, 2019, edison international declared a dividend of $0.6125 per share to be paid on april 30, 2019. edison international parent and other's liquidity and its ability to pay operating expenses and pay dividends to common shareholders are dependent on access to the bank and capital markets, dividends from sce, realization of tax benefits, and its ability to meet california law requirements for the declaration of dividends. prior to declaring dividends, edison international's board of directors evaluates available information, including when applicable, information pertaining to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, to ensure that the california law requirements for the declarations are met. for information on the california law requirements on the declaration of dividends, see "-sce-sce dividends."

edison international intends to maintain its target payout ratio of 45% - 55% of sce's core earnings, subject to the factors identified above. edison international may finance common stock dividends, working capital requirements, payment of obligations, and capital investments, including capital contributions to subsidiaries, with short-term or other financings, subject to availability in the bank and capital markets.
as a result of the sale of socore energy, edison energy group made dividend payments to edison international parent of
$101 million in 2018.
in may 2018, edison international parent amended its multi-year revolving credit facility to increase the facility from
$1.25 billion to $1.5 billion. at december 31, 2018 , edison international parent had $97 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.5 billion available under its credit facility. the credit facility is available for borrowing needs until may 2023 and contains two 1-year extension options. the debt covenant in edison international parent's credit facility requires a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio as defined in the credit agreement of less than or equal to 0.70 to 1 . at december 31, 2018 , edison international parent's consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.55 to 1 . for further details, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 5.
debt and credit agreements."
at december 31, 2018 , edison international parent was in compliance with all financial covenants that affect access to capital.
edison international parent's long-term issuer credit ratings remain at investment grade levels after downgrade actions taken by the major credit rating agencies in 2018 and early 2019. the following table summarizes edison international parent's current, long-term issuer credit ratings and outlook from the major credit rating agencies:

2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, and the reform of policies allocating liability to investor-owned utilities for damages caused by catastrophic wildfires substantially caused by utility equipment. credit rating downgrades increase the cost and may impact the availability of short-term and long-term borrowings, including commercial paper, credit facilities, note financings or other borrowings.
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards edison international has approximately $1.2 billion of tax effected net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at december 31, 2018 (after offsetting $178 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $212 million of capistrano wind net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards), which are available to offset future consolidated tax liabilities. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 8. income taxes" for further information regarding taxes payable to capistrano wind. the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at december 31,
2017 reflected the impact of tax reform, which reduced the valuation of net operating loss carryforwards, but did not affect the amount of future taxable income that may be offset. tax reform also limited the utilization of nols arising after december 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward and places limitations on the ability of regulated utilities to qualify for immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures. tax reform did not impact the valuation of tax credit carryforwards, which directly offset taxes due. as a result of the forgoing, edison international expects to realize its nol and tax credit carryforward position through 2024.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the following:
net income and non-cash items decreased in 2018 by $3.1 billion from 2017 and increased in 2017 by $578 million from 2016 . excluding the $2.5 billion charge for wildfire-related claims, net of expected recoveries from insurance and ferc customers, the decrease in 2018 was due to the impact of the july 2017 cost of capital decision on grc revenue, higher operation and maintenance expenses related to wildfire insurance premiums and vegetation management and higher net financing costs, partially offset by higher income tax benefits, and lower non-cash items. the increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from the escalation mechanism set forth in the 2015 grc decision and lower operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher financing costs, and higher non-cash items. the factors that impacted these items are discussed under "results of operations-sce-earning activities." non-cash items included changes in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits of $(552) million,

$716 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
net cash for working capital was $(313) million , $(148) million and $243 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. the net cash for each period was primarily related to timing of disbursements of $(15) million, $125
million and $45 million in
23
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and changes in receivables from customers of $(288) million, $163 million and
$220 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. net cash for working capital also included insurance premium payments of $197 million and $121 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily for wildfire related coverage.
net cash provided by regulatory assets and liabilities, including changes in (under) over collections of balancing accounts, was $(92) million , $4 million and $(292) million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. sce has a number of balancing accounts, which impact cash flows based on differences between timing of collection of amounts through rates and accrual expenditures. cash flows were primarily impacted by the following:
2018
brrba overcollections increased by $428 million primarily due to a $263 million reclassification of 2017
•  incremental tax benefits from tama to brrba (to be refunded in 2019) and higher sales than forecasted in rates, partially offset by a refund of 2016 incremental tax benefits.
higher cash from increased regulatory liabilities of approximately $365 million primarily due to the delay in the 2018 grc decision. during 2018, the amounts billed to customers were largely based on the 2017
•  authorized grc revenue requirement, however, the amount of revenue recognized has been adjusted mainly for the july 2017 cost of capital decision and tax reform pending the outcome of the 2018 grc and therefore, a regulatory liability has been established to record any associated adjustments.
net undercollections for erra and the new system generation program were $741 million and $267 million atdecember 31, 2018and 2017, respectively. net undercollections increased $474 million during 2018 primarily
•  due to an increase in costs due to higher than forecasted power and gas prices experienced in 2018 and higher load requirements than forecasted in rates, partially offset by an increase in cash due to recovery of prior year undercollections.
•  tama overcollections decreased by $287 million primarily due to a $263 million reclassification from tama to brrba to refund customers as discussed above.
undercollections of $128 million related to the establishment, in the fourth quarter of 2018, of a wildfire expense memorandum account ("wema") to track wildfire related costs including insurance premiums in excess
•  of the amounts that will be ultimately approved in the 2018 grc decision. for further information, see
"notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides."
2017
tama overcollections increased by $117 million during 2017 primarily due to higher tax repair deductions
•  than forecasted in rates and $135 million of higher benefits recognized for tax accounting method changes, partially offset by a $226 million reclassification from tama to brrba to refund customers.
higher cash due to $153 million of overcollections for the public purpose and energy efficiency programs.
•  the increase in cash was due to lower spending than billed to customers and recovery of prior year undercollections.
•  higher cash due to $136 million of overcollections related to ferc balancing accounts. the increase in cash was due to recovery of prior ferc undercollections and lower costs than previously forecasted.
higher cash due to proceeds of approximately $34 million from the department of energy related to spent
•  nuclear fuel. for further information on the spent nuclear fuel, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-spent nuclear fuel."
brrba overcollections decreased by $226 million during 2017 primarily due to the refunds of 2015 tama overcollections, a revenue refund to customers of $133 million for 2012 - 2014 incremental tax benefits
•  related to repair deductions, and 2015 overcollections resulting from the implementation of the 2015 grc decision, which was authorized to be refunded to customers over a two year period, partially offset by a
$226 million reclassification from tama to brrba to refund customers in january 2018 as discussed above.
net undercollections for erra and the new system generation program were $267 million at december 31, 2017
compared to net overcollections of $26 million at december 31, 2016. lower cash due to $293 million of net
•  undercollections in 2017 primarily due to a refund of prior year overcollections and an increase in costs due to higher than forecasted power and gas prices experienced in 2017 and higher load requirements than forecasted in rates.
24
2016
lower cash due to a decrease in erra overcollections for fuel and purchased power of $419 million in 2016
•  primarily due to the implementation of the 2016 erra rate decrease in january 2016, partially offset by lower than forecasted power and gas prices experienced in 2016.
the public purpose and energy efficiency programs track differences between amounts authorized by the cpuc
•  and amounts incurred to fund programs established by the cpuc. overcollections increased by $309 million in
2016 due to higher funding and lower spending for these programs.
sce had a decrease in cash of approximately $182 million primarily due to a 2016 refund of 2015
•  overcollections resulting from the implementation of the 2015 grc decision which was authorized to be refunded to customers over a two year period.
cash flows used in other noncurrent assets and liabilities were primarily related to net earnings from nuclear decommissioning trust investments ( $41 million , $55 million and $45 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively)
and sce's payments of decommissioning costs ( $140 million , $236 million and $168 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively). see "nuclear decommissioning activities" below for further discussion.

interest rate risk edison international and sce are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing, investing and borrowing activities used for liquidity purposes, and to fund business operations and capital investments. the nature and amount of edison international and sce's long-term and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. fluctuations in interest rates can affect earnings and cash flows. changes in interest rates may impact sce's authorized rate of return for the period beyond 2018, see "business-sce-overview of ratemaking process" for further discussion. the following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair value of long-term debt including the current portion, if the market interest rates were changed while leaving all other assumptions the same:

commodity price risk sce and its customers are exposed to the risk of a change in the market price of natural gas, electric power and transmission congestion. sce's hedging program is designed to reduce exposure to variability in market prices related to sce's purchases and sales of electric power and natural gas. sce expects recovery of its related hedging costs through the erra balancing account or cpuc-approved procurement plans, and as a result, exposure to commodity price is not expected to impact earnings, but may impact timing of cash flows. as part of this program, sce enters into energy options, swaps, forward arrangements, and congestion revenue rights ("crrs"). the transactions are pre-
approved by the cpuc or executed in compliance with cpuc-approved procurement plans.
fair value of derivative instruments the fair value of derivative instruments is included in the consolidated balance sheets unless subject to an exception under the applicable accounting guidance. realized gains and losses from derivative instruments are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and, accordingly, changes in sce's fair value have no impact on earnings. sce does not use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment. for further discussion on fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy, see "notes to consolidated financial statements - note 4. fair value measurements."
the fair value of outstanding derivative instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk was a net asset of $167 million and $109 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

credit risk for information related to credit risks, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 6. derivative instruments."
credit risk exposure from counterparties for power and gas trading activities is measured as the sum of net accounts receivable (accounts receivable less accounts payable) and the current fair value of net derivative assets
(derivative assets less derivative liabilities) reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. sce enters into master agreements which typically provide for a right of setoff. accordingly, sce's credit risk exposure from counterparties is based on a net exposure under these arrangements. sce manages the credit risk on the portfolio for both rated and non-rated counterparties based on credit ratings using published ratings of counterparties and other publicly disclosed information, such as financial statements, regulatory filings, and press releases, to guide it in the process of setting credit levels, risk limits and contractual arrangements, including master netting agreements.
as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount of balance sheet exposure as described above broken down by the credit ratings of sce's counterparties, was as follows:

critical accounting estimates and policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of edison international and sce's consolidated financial statements because their application requires the use of significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements. management estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires significant assumptions and changes in the estimate or, the use of alternative estimates, could have a material impact on edison international's results of operations or financial position. for more information on edison international's accounting policies, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 1. summary of significant accounting policies."
rate regulated enterprises nature of estimate required. sce follows the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises which are required for entities whose rates are set by regulators at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. regulators may also impose penalties or grant incentives. due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue, these principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by an unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates; conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers. in addition, sce recognizes revenue and regulatory assets from alternative revenue programs, which enables the utility to adjust future rates in response to past activities or completed events, if certain criteria are met, even for programs that do not qualify for recognition of "traditional" regulatory assets and liabilities.
accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises also require recognition of an impairment loss if it becomes probable that the regulated utility will abandon a plant investment, or if it becomes probable that the cost of a recently completed plant will be disallowed, either directly or indirectly, for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made.
30
key assumptions and approach used. sce's management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment, the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost to sce or other rate-regulated entities, and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes. using these factors, management has determined that existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or settlement. this determination reflects the current regulatory climate and is subject to change in the future. sce also considers whether any plant investments are probable of abandonment or disallowance.
effect if different assumptions used. significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and plant investments, the recognition of incentives and revenue subject to refund, as well as the anticipated cost of regulatory liabilities or penalties. if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, all or part of the regulatory assets, plant investments and/or liabilities would have to be written off against current period earnings. at december 31, 2018, the consolidated balance sheets included regulatory assets of $6.5 billion and regulatory liabilities of $9.9 billion . if different judgments were reached on recovery of costs and timing of income recognition, sce's earnings may vary from the amounts reported. sce has incurred approximately $42 million of capital expenditures related to the alberhill system project, including overhead costs, as of december 31, 2018, of which approximately $31 million may not be recoverable if the project is cancelled (refer to "liquidity and capital resources-sce-capital investment plan").
application to tax reform as discussed in "management overview-tax reform," in december 2017, tax reform was signed into law. this comprehensive reform of tax law reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and is generally effective beginning january 1, 2018. us gaap requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. thus, at the date of enactment, the deferred taxes were re-measured based upon the new tax rate. the re-measurement of sce's deferred taxes was recorded against regulatory assets and liabilities when the pre-tax amounts giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were funded by customers and were recorded to earnings when amounts were funded by shareholders.
in the absence of regulatory guidance, judgment is required to estimate which deferred tax re-measurements will be refunded to customers and are subject to change based on the outcome of the regulatory processes. amounts to be refunded to customers are expected to generally be refunded over the life of the underlying asset or liability that gave rise to the deferred taxes. at december 31, 2017, the implementation of tax reform at sce resulted in a reduction of deferred tax liabilities and an increase in regulatory liabilities of approximately $5.0 billion .
in 2018, sce made filings with the cpuc and ferc to obtain regulatory guidance to address how to return excess deferred taxes applicable to customers. changes in the allocation to customers of the deferred tax re-measurement is reflected in the financial statements and is adjusted prospectively as information becomes available through the regulatory process.
income taxes nature of estimates required. as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, edison international and sce are required to estimate income taxes for each jurisdiction in which they operate. this process involves estimating actual current period tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within edison international and sce's consolidated balance sheets, including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to reduce liabilities in future periods.
edison international and sce take certain tax positions they believe are in accordance with the applicable tax laws. however, these tax positions are subject to interpretation by the irs, state tax authorities and the courts.
edison international and sce determine uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance.
key assumptions and approach used. accounting for tax obligations requires management judgment. edison international and sce's management use judgment in determining whether the evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that a tax position will be sustained, and to determine the amount of tax benefits to be recognized. judgment is also used in determining the likelihood a tax position will be settled and possible settlement outcomes. in assessing uncertain tax positions edison international and sce consider, among others, the following factors: the facts and circumstances of the position, regulations, rulings, and case law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, and the experience gained from similar tax positions. edison international and sce's management evaluates uncertain tax positions at the end of each reporting period and makes adjustments when warranted based on changes in fact or law.
31
effect if different assumptions used. actual income taxes may differ from the estimated amounts which could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded in the financial statements. edison international and sce continue to be under audit or subject to audit for multiple years in various jurisdictions.
significant judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular tax positions that involve interpretations of complex tax laws. such liabilities are based on judgment and a final determination could take many years from the time the liability is recorded. furthermore, settlement of tax positions included in open tax years may be resolved by compromises of tax positions based on current factors and business considerations that may result in material adjustments to income taxes previously estimated.
nuclear decommissioning - asset retirement obligation key assumptions and approach used. san onofre units 1, 2 and 3 decommissioning cost estimates are updated in each ndtcp and when there are material changes to the timing or amount of estimated future cash flows. palo verde decommissioning cost estimates are updated by the operating agent, arizona public services, every three years and when there are material changes to the timing or amount of estimated future cash flows. sce estimates that it will spend approximately $7.2 billion undiscounted through 2079 to decommission its nuclear facilities.
the current aro estimates for san onofre and palo verde are based on:
decommissioning costs. the estimated costs for labor, "material, equipment and other," and low-level radioactive waste costs are included in each of the nrc decommissioning stages; license termination, site restoration, and spent fuel storage. the liability to decommission sce's nuclear power facilities is based
•  on a 2017 decommissioning study that was filed as part of the 2018 ndtcp for san onofre units 1, 2, and 3, with revisions to the cost estimate in 2018 for san onofre units 2 and 3 and a 2016 decommissioning study for palo verde, with revisions to the cost estimate in 2017. sce revised the aro for san onofre units 2 and
3 due to increases in decommissioning cost estimates in 2018, related to the impact of operational uncertainties, and in 2017, related to changes to onboarding the general contractor at san onofre.
escalation rates. annual escalation rates are used to convert the decommissioning cost estimates in base year dollars to decommissioning cost estimates in future-year dollars. escalation rates are primarily used
•  for labor, material, equipment, and low-level radioactive waste burial costs. sce's current estimates are based upon sce's decommissioning cost methodology used for ratemaking purposes. average escalation rates range from2.2%to7.5%(depending on the cost element) annually.
timing. cost estimates for palo verde are based on an assumption that decommissioning will commence promptly after the current nrc operating licenses expire. the palo verde 1, 2, 3 operating licenses currently expire
•  in 2045, 2046 and 2047, respectively. initial decommissioning activities at san onofre unit 1 started in
1999 and at units 2 and 3 in 2013. cost estimates for san onofre units are currently based on completion of decommissioning activities by 2051.
spent fuel dry storage costs. cost estimates are based on an assumption that the doe will begin to take
•  spent fuel from the nuclear industry in 2028, and will remove the last spent fuel from the san onofre and palo verde sites by 2049 and 2078, respectively.
•  changes in decommissioning technology, regulation, and economics. the current cost studies assume the use of current technologies under current regulations and at current cost levels.
see "liquidity and capital resources-sce-decommissioning of san onofre" for further discussion of the plans for decommissioning of san onofre.
effect if different assumptions used. the aro for decommissioning sce's nuclear facilities was $2.8 billion as of december 31, 2018, based on the decommissioning studies performed and the subsequent cost estimate updates. changes in the estimated costs, execution strategy or timing of decommissioning, or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates, could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission these facilities which could have a material effect on the recorded liability. the spent fuel transfer operations for san onofre units 2 and 3 were suspended on august 3, 2018 due to an incident that occurred when an sce contractor was loading a spent fuel canister into the isfsi. the incident did not result in any harm to the public or workers and the canister was subsequently safely loaded into the isfsi. sce cannot predict when fuel transfer operations at san onofre will recommence.
32
the following table illustrates the increase to the aro liability if the cost escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant:

percentage point the increase in the aro liability driven by an increase in the escalation rate would result in a decrease in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of aro liabilities.
pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions nature of estimate required. authoritative accounting guidance requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet; the assets and/or liabilities are normally offset through other comprehensive income (loss). in accordance with authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded instead of charges and credits to other comprehensive income (loss) for its postretirement benefit plans that are recoverable in utility rates. edison international and sce have a fiscal year-end measurement date for all of its postretirement plans.
key assumptions of approach used. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models. two critical assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense, and the discount rate is important to liability measurement. additionally, health care cost trend rates are critical assumptions for postretirement health care plans. these critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually. other assumptions, which require management judgment, such as rate of compensation increases and rates of retirement and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience.
as of december 31, 2018 , edison international's and sce's pension plans had a $3.9 billion and $3.4 billion benefit obligation, respectively, and total 2018 expense for these plans was $65 million and $61 million , respectively. as of december 31, 2018 , the benefit obligation for both edison international's and sce's pbop plans were $2.0 billion , and total 2018 expense for edison international's and sce's plans was $19 million and $18
million , respectively. annual contributions made to most of sce's pension plans are currently recovered through cpuc-approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be, at a minimum, equal to the related annual expense.
pension expense is recorded for sce based on the amount funded to the trusts, as calculated using an actuarial method required for ratemaking purposes, in which the impact of market volatility on plan assets is recognized in earnings on a more gradual basis. any difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with ratemaking methods and pension expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for pension is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability, and is expected, over time, to be recovered from or returned to customers. as of december 31, 2018 , this cumulative difference amounted to a regulatory asset of $107 million , meaning that the accounting method has recognized more in expense than the ratemaking method since implementation of authoritative guidance for employers' accounting for pensions in 1987.
edison international and sce used the following critical assumptions to determine expense for pension and other postretirement benefit for 2018 :
pension        postretirement

assets2
assumed health care cost trend rates3     *           6.75  %
*  not applicable to pension plans.
the discount rate enables edison international and sce to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. edison international and sce select its discount rate by performing a yield
1  curve analysis. this analysis determines the equivalent discount rate on projected cash flows, matching the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. the aon-hewitt yield curve is considered in determining the discount rate.
33
to determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, current and expected asset allocations are considered, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. a portion of pbop trusts asset returns are subject to taxation, so the5.3%rate of return on plan assets above is determined on an after-tax basis. actual time-weighted, annualized (losses) returns on the pension plan assets were
(2.4)%, 5.9% and 10.1% for the one-year, five-year and ten-year periods endeddecember 31, 2018, respectively. actual time-weighted, annualized (losses) returns on the pbop plan assets were (4.78)%, 4.86%
and 9.2% over these same periods. accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual
2  returns are recognized over the average future service of employees.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3  the health care cost trend rate gradually declines to5.0%for2029and beyond.
as of december 31, 2018 , edison international and sce had unrecognized pension costs of $353 million and $288
million , and unrecognized pbop gains of $184 million and $185 million , respectively. the unrecognized pension costs and pbop gains primarily consisted of the cumulative impact of the reduced discount rates on the respective benefit obligations and the cumulative difference between the expected and actual rate of return on plan assets. of these deferred costs (gains), $271 million of sce's pension costs and $(185) million of sce's pbop gains are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, respectively, and are expected to be recovered (refunded)
over the average expected future service of employees.
edison international's and sce's pension and pbop plans are subject to limits established for federal tax deductibility. sce funds its pension and pbop plans in accordance with amounts allowed by the cpuc. executive pension plans have no plan assets.
effect if different assumptions used. changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates, could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities.
the following table summarizes the increase or (decrease) to projected benefit obligation for pension and the accumulated benefit obligation for pbop if the discount rate were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant:

accounting for contingencies nature of estimates required. edison international and sce record loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized.
key assumptions and approach used. the determination of a reserve for a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates with respect to the likely outcome of the matter, including the analysis of different scenarios. liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. in assessing whether a loss is a reasonable possibility, edison international and sce may consider the following factors, among others: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, available information, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases. edison international and sce provide disclosures for material contingencies when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred.
effect if different assumptions used. actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements. for a discussion of contingencies, guarantees and indemnities, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies."
application to southern california wildfires as discussed in "management overview," significant wildfires in december 2017 and november 2018 impacted portions of sce's service territory causing substantial damage to both residential and business properties and service outages for sce customers.
any potential liability of sce for damages related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events will depend on a number of factors, including whether sce is determined to have substantially caused, or contributed to, the damages and whether parties seeking recovery of damages will be required to show negligence in addition to causation.
investigations into the causes of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events are ongoing and final determinations of liability, including determinations of whether sce was negligent, would only be made during lengthy and complex litigation processes.
management judgment was required to assess whether a loss contingency was probable and reasonably estimable. based on sce's internal review into the facts and circumstances of each of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events and consideration of the risks associated with litigation, edison international and sce expect to incur a material loss in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events and have accrued a charge, before recoveries and taxes, of $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. edison international and sce also recorded expected recoveries from insurance of $2.0 billion and expected recoveries through ferc electric rates of $135 million . the net charge to earnings recorded was $1.8 billion after-tax.
this charge corresponds to the lower end of the reasonably estimated range of expected potential losses that may be incurred in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events. edison international and sce currently believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of the actual loss will be greater than the amount accrued. however, edison international and sce are currently unable to reasonably estimate an upper end of the range of expected losses given the uncertainty as to the legal and factual determinations to be made during litigation, including uncertainty as to the contributing causes of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, the complexities associated with multiple ignition points, the potential for separate damages to be attributable to fires ignited at separate ignition points, whether inverse condemnation will be held applicable to sce with respect to damages caused by the montecito mudslides, and the preliminary nature of the litigation processes. edison international and sce record insurance receivables when the recovery of a recorded loss is determined to be probable. edison international and sce will seek to offset any actual losses realized with recoveries from insurance policies in place at the time of the events and, to the extent actual losses exceed insurance, through electric rates.
recovery of uninsured costs through electric rates is subject to approval by regulators. under accounting standards for rate-regulated enterprises, sce defers costs as regulatory assets when it concludes that such costs are probable of future recovery in electric rates. sce utilizes objectively determinable evidence to form its view on probability of future recovery. the only directly comparable precedent in which a california investor-owned utility has sought recovery for uninsured wildfire-related costs is sdg&e's requests for cost recovery related to 2007
wildfire activity, where ferc allowed recovery of all ferc-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs while the cpuc rejected recovery of all cpuc-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs based on a determination that sdg&e did not meet the cpuc's prudency standard. as a result, while sce does not agree with the cpuc's decision, it believes that the cpuc's interpretation and application of the prudency standard to sdg&e creates substantial uncertainty regarding how that standard will be applied to an investor-owned utility in future wildfire cost-recovery proceedings. through the operation of its ferc formula rate, and based upon the precedent established in sdg&e's recovery of ferc-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs, sce believes it is probable it will recover its ferc-
35
jurisdictional wildfire and mudslide related costs and has recorded a regulatory asset of $135 million , the ferc portion of the $4.7 billion charge it accrued. the cpuc and ferc may reach different conclusions than sce's current determination of probable outcomes.
over the course of the various investigations and litigation processes associated with each of the 2017/2018
wildfire/mudslide events, new facts may emerge as to the cause, extent and magnitude of potential damages. the amount of the expected loss and recorded receivables are subject to change based on new or additional information.

risk factors risks relating to edison international edison international's liquidity and ability to pay dividends depends on its ability to borrow funds, access to bank capital markets, monetization of tax benefits retained by eme, and sce's ability to pay dividends and tax allocation payments to edison international.
edison international is a holding company and, as such, it has no operations of its own. edison international's ability to meet its financial obligations, make investments, and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of sce and its ability to make upstream distributions. if sce does not make upstream distributions to edison international and edison international is unable to access the bank and capital markets on reasonable terms, edison international may be unable to continue to pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its financial obligations.
prior to paying dividends to edison international, sce has financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends. further, sce and edison international cannot pay dividends if california law requirements for the declaration of dividends are not met. for information on cpuc and california law requirements related to the declaration of dividends, see
"liquidity and capital resources-sce-sce dividends" in the md&a. sce may also owe tax-allocation payments to edison international under applicable tax-allocation agreements.
edison international's ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including its levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. in addition, the factors affecting sce's business will impact edison international's ability to obtain financing. edison international's inability to borrow funds from time to time could have a material effect on edison international's liquidity and operations.
see "risks relating to southern california edison company" below for further discussion.
edison international's business activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region.
edison international business activities are concentrated in the electricity industry. its principal subsidiary, sce, serves customers only in southern and central california. as a result, edison international's future performance may be affected by events and economic factors unique to california or by regional regulation, legislation or judicial decisions. for example, california courts have applied strict liability to investor-owned utilities in wildfire and other litigation matters. see "management overview-southern california wildfires and mudslides" in the md&a.
edison energy group may not be successful.
edison international, through edison energy, is pursuing an energy services business focused on large commercial and industrial customers by providing unbiased expertise to help define energy requirements and implement solutions to better manage energy costs and risks. there is no assurance that these activities will lead to growth or be profitable.

risks relating to southern california edison company regulatory and legislative risks sce's financial results depend upon its ability to recover its costs and to earn a reasonable rate of return on capital investments in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates.
sce's ongoing financial results depend on its ability to recover its costs from its customers, including the costs of electricity purchased for its customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the cpuc and ferc. sce's financial results also depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-
term debt and equity. sce's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many factors, including the time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers' rates and differences between the forecast or authorized costs embedded in rates (which are set on a prospective basis) and the amount of actual costs incurred. the cpuc or the ferc may not allow sce to recover costs on the basis that such costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. further, sce may be required to incur expenses before the relevant regulatory agency approves the recovery of such costs. for example, sce is incurring costs to strengthen its wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts before it is clear whether such costs will be recoverable from customers. also, to the extent sce is required to pay uninsured wildfire-related damages, as expected, recovery of such costs may be denied if the cpuc determines that sce was not prudent. in addition, while sce supports california's environmental goals, it may be prevented from fully executing on its strategy to support such goals by regulatory delay or lack of approval of cost-recovery for the costs of such strategic actions from the relevant regulatory agencies. in addition, sce's capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, increasing environmental regulations, leveling demand, and the cumulative impact of other public policy requirements, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. if sce is unable to obtain a sufficient rate increase or modify its rate design to recover its costs
(including an adequate return on capital) in rates in a timely manner, its financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. for further information on sce's rate requests, see "management overview-2018 general rate case" and "liquidity and capital resources-sce-regulatory proceedings-ferc formula rate"
in the md&a.
sce is subject to extensive regulation and the risk of adverse regulatory and legislative decisions and changes in applicable regulations or legislation.
sce operates in a highly regulated environment. sce's business is subject to extensive federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations. among other things, the cpuc regulates sce's retail rates and capital structure, and the ferc regulates sce's wholesale rates. the nrc regulates the decommissioning of san onofre in addition to the local and state agencies that require permits. the construction, planning, and siting of sce's power plants and transmission lines in california are also subject to regulation by the cpuc and other local, state and federal agencies.
sce must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective orders. should sce be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on sce, sce may be prevented from executing its strategy and its business could be materially affected. the process of obtaining licenses and permits from regulatory authorities may be delayed or defeated by opponents and such delay or defeat could have a material effect on sce's business.
rules, restrictions and processes around ex parte communications could result in delayed decisions, increased investigations, enforcement actions and penalties. in addition, the cpuc or other parties may initiate investigations of past communications between public utilities, including sce, and cpuc officials and staff that could result in reopening completed proceedings for reconsideration.
edison international and sce continue to pursue legal, legislative and regulatory avenues to address the application of a strict liability standard to wildfire-related damages without the ability to recover resulting costs in electric rates. not achieving a timely and comprehensive solution mitigating the significant risk faced by california investor-owned utilities related to liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where utility facilities are a substantial cause, could have a detrimental effect on sce's business and financial condition. in addition, cpuc approval is required to recover the costs sce is incurring to strengthen its wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts described in its 2019 wmp, including costs being incurred for its gs&rp. further, the cpuc may assess penalties on sce if it finds that sce fails to substantially comply with its wmp. see
"management overview-southern california wildfires and mudslides" and "management overview-capital program-distribution grid" in the md&a.
in addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to sce, or its facilities or operations, in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on sce's business or result in
37
significant additional costs. in addition, regulations adopted via the public initiative or legislative process may apply to sce, or its facilities or operations, in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on sce's business or result in significant additional costs.
sce's energy procurement activities are subject to regulatory and market risks that could materially affect its financial condition and liquidity.
sce obtains energy, capacity, environmental credits and ancillary services needed to serve its customers from its own generating plants and through contracts with energy producers and sellers. california law and cpuc decisions allow sce to recover, through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, reasonable procurement costs incurred in compliance with an approved procurement plan. nonetheless, sce's cash flows remain subject to volatility primarily resulting from changes in commodity prices, including as a result of gas supply constraints.
additionally, significant and prolonged gas use restrictions may adversely impact the reliability of the electric grid if critical generation resources are limited in their operations. for further information, see
"business-sce-purchased power and fuel supply." sce is also subject to the risks of unfavorable or untimely cpuc decisions about the compliance with sce's procurement plan and the reasonableness of certain procurement-related costs.
sce may not be able to hedge its risk for commodities on economic terms or fully recover the costs of hedges through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, which could materially affect sce's liquidity and results of operations, see "market risk exposures" in the md&a.
operating risks damage claims against sce for wildfire-related losses may materially affect sce's financial condition and results of operations.
prolonged drought conditions and shifting weather patterns in california resulting from climate change as well as increased tree mortality rates have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the risk of severe wildfire events. severe wildfires and increased urban development in high fire risk areas in california have given rise to large damage claims against california utilities for fire-related losses alleged to be the result of utility practices and/or the failure of electric and other utility equipment. california courts have previously found utilities to be strictly liable for property damage, regardless of fault, by applying the theory of inverse condemnation when a utility's facilities were determined to be a substantial cause of a wildfire that caused the property damage. the rationale generally stated by these courts for applying this theory to investor-owned utilities is that property losses resulting from a public improvement, such as the distribution of electricity, can be spread across the larger community that benefited from such improvement. however, in december 2017, the cpuc issued a decision denying an investor-owned utility's request to include in its rates uninsured wildfire-related costs arising from several 2007 fires, finding that the investor-owned utility did not prudently manage and operate its facilities prior to or at the outset of the 2007 wildfires. an inability to recover uninsured wildfire-related costs could materially affect sce's business, financial condition and results of operations. for example, if sce is found liable for damages related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, and sce is unable to, or believes that it will be unable to, recover those damages through insurance or electric rates, sce may not have sufficient cash or equity to pay dividends or may be restricted from declaring such dividends because it does not meet cpuc or california law requirements related to the declaration of dividends. for information on the california law requirements on the declaration of dividends, see "liquidity and capital resources-sce-sce dividends" in the md&a.
see "management overview-southern california wildfires and mudslides" in the md&a.
sce's insurance coverage for wildfires arising from its ordinary operations may not be sufficient.
edison international has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise in connection with sce's ordinary operations. edison international, sce or its contractors may experience coverage reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. no assurance can be given that losses will not exceed the limits of sce's or its contractors' insurance coverage. sce may not be able to recover uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance in customer rates. losses which are not fully insured or cannot be recovered in electric rates could materially affect edison international's and sce's financial condition and results of operations. for more information on wildfire insurance risk, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides."

there are inherent risks associated with owning and decommissioning nuclear power generating facilities and obtaining cost reimbursement, including, among other things, insufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust funds, costs exceeding current estimates, execution risks, potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and the hazards of storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials. existing insurance and ratemaking arrangements may not protect sce fully against losses from a nuclear incident.
sce funds decommissioning costs with assets that are currently held in nuclear decommissioning trusts. based on current decommissioning cost estimates, sce believes that further contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trusts' assets may be required to pay the costs of decommissioning. in the event that additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds become necessary, recovery of any such additional funds through electric rates is subject to the cpuc's review and approval.
the costs of decommissioning san onofre are subject to reasonableness reviews by the cpuc. these costs may not be recoverable through regulatory processes or otherwise unless sce can establish that the costs were reasonably incurred. in addition, sce faces inherent execution risks including such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, public opposition, permitting delays, and governmental approvals. decommissioning costs ultimately incurred could exceed the current estimates and cost increases resulting from contractual disputes or significant permitting delays, among other things, could cause sce to materially overrun current decommissioning cost estimates and could materially impact the sufficiency of trust funds. see "liquidity and capital resources-decommissioning of san onofre" in the md&a.
despite the fact that san onofre is being decommissioned, the presence of spent nuclear fuel still poses a potential risk of a nuclear incident. federal law limits public liability claims from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection, which is currently approximately $14.1 billion for palo verde and $560
million for san onofre. sce and other owners of san onofre and palo verde have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available of $450 million per site. in the case of san onofre, the balance is covered by a us government indemnity. in the case of palo verde, the balance is covered by a loss sharing program among nuclear reactor licensees. there is no assurance that the cpuc would allow sce to recover the required contribution made pursuant to this loss sharing program in the case of one or more nuclear incidents with claims that exceeded $450
million at a nuclear reactor which is participating in the program. if this public liability limit of $13.9 billion is insufficient, federal law contemplates that additional funds may be appropriated by congress. there can be no assurance of sce's ability to recover uninsured costs in the event the additional federal appropriations are insufficient. for more information on nuclear insurance risk, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note
12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-nuclear insurance."
climate change exacerbated weather-related incidents and other natural disasters could materially affect sce's financial condition and results of operations.
weather-related incidents and other natural disasters, including storms, earthquakes, and events caused, or exacerbated, by climate change, such as wildfires and mudslides, can disrupt the generation and transmission of electricity, and can seriously damage the infrastructure necessary to deliver power to sce's customers. climate change has caused, and exacerbated, extreme weather events and wildfires in southern california, and wildfires could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage and operational issues. weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can lead to lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance and repair costs, which sce may not be able to recover from its customers. these incidents can also result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if sce encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if fire-related losses are found to be the result of utility practices and/or the failure of electric and other utility equipment. in addition, these occurrences could lead to significant claims for damages, including for loss of life and property damage. for example, the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events resulted in, among other things, loss of life, property damage and loss of service. these occurrences could materially affect sce's business, financial condition and results of operations, and the inability to restore power to sce's customers could also materially damage the business reputation of sce and edison international. for more information on the impact of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events on sce and edison international, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides."
the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity are dangerous and involve inherent risks of damage to private property and injury to employees and the general public.
electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with electrical current or equipment, including through downed power lines or if equipment malfunctions. in addition, the risks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generating facilities include public and employee safety issues and the risk of utility assets causing or contributing to wildfires.
39
injuries and property damage caused by such events can subject sce to liability that, despite the existence of insurance coverage, can be significant. no assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of sce's or its contractors' insurance coverage. the cpuc has increased its focus on public safety with an emphasis on heightened compliance with construction and operating standards and the potential for penalties being imposed on utilities. additionally, the cpuc has delegated to its staff the authority to issue citations to electric utilities, which can impose fines of up to $100,000 per violation per day (capped at a maximum of $8 million), pursuant to the cpuc's jurisdiction for violations of safety rules found in statutes, regulations, and the cpuc's general orders. such penalties and liabilities could be significant and materially affect sce's liquidity and results of operations.
sce's financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage the risks inherent in operating and maintaining its facilities.
sce's infrastructure is aging and could pose a risk to system reliability. in order to mitigate this risk, sce is engaged in a significant and ongoing infrastructure investment program. this substantial investment program elevates operational risks and the need for superior execution in sce's activities. sce's financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage these risks as well as the risks inherent in operating and maintaining its facilities, the operation of which can be hazardous. sce's inherent operating risks include such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, public opposition to infrastructure projects, delays, environmental mitigation costs, difficulty in estimating costs or in recovering costs that are above original estimates, system limitations and degradation, and interruptions in necessary supplies.
financing risks as a capital intensive company, sce relies on access to the capital markets. if sce were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its liquidity and operations could be materially affected.
sce regularly accesses the capital markets to finance its activities and is expected to do so by its regulators as part of its obligation to serve as a regulated utility. sce's needs for capital for its ongoing infrastructure investment program are substantial. sce's ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal, interest and preferred stock dividends, are dependent on numerous factors, including sce's levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. in addition, the actions of other california investor-owned utilities and legal, regulatory and legislative decisions impacting investor-owned utilities can affect market conditions and therefore, sce's ability to obtain financing. sce's inability to obtain additional capital from time to time could have a material effect on sce's liquidity and operations.
competitive and market risks sce's inability to effectively and timely respond to the changes that the electricity industry is undergoing, as a result of increased competition, technological advances, and changes to the regulatory environment, could materially impact sce's business model, financial condition and results of operations.
customers and third parties are increasingly deploying ders, such as solar generation, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response technologies. california's environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of industry change. this change will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid's capacity to interconnect ders. in addition, enabling california's clean energy economy goals will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options and electric vehicle infrastructures. to this end, the cpuc is conducting proceedings to: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of ders; consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by ders, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. the outcome of the cpuc's proceedings may impact sce's business model, its ability to execute on its strategy, and ultimately its financial condition and results of operations. for more information, see "management overview-capital program-grid development" in the md&a.
customer-owned generation and ccas each reduce the amount of electricity that customers purchase from utilities and have the effect of increasing utility rates unless customer rates are designed to allocate the costs of the distribution grid across all customers that benefit from its use. for example, customers in california who generate their own power do not currently pay all transmission and distribution charges and non-bypassable charges, subject to limitations, which results in increased utility rates for those customers who do not own their generation. if regulations aren't changed such that customers pay their share of transmission and distribution charges and non-
bypassable charges or the demand for electricity reduces so significantly
40
that sce is no longer effectively able to recover such charges from its customers, sce's business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially impacted.
in addition, the ferc has opened transmission development to competition from independent developers, allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities.
for more information. see "business-sce-competition."
cybersecurity and physical security risks sce's systems and network infrastructure are vulnerable to physical and cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality.
regulators such as nerc and u.s. government agencies, including the departments of defense, homeland security and energy, have increasingly stressed that threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the u.s. national electric grid and other energy infrastructures, and that such attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are highly sophisticated and dynamic.
sce's operations require the continuous availability of critical information technology systems, sensitive customer data, network infrastructure and information - all of which are represent targets for malicious actors. new cyber and physical threats arise as sce moves from an analog to a digital electric grid. for example, sce's grid modernization efforts and the move to a network-connected grid increases the number of "threat surfaces" and potential vulnerabilities that an adversary can target.
sce depends on a wide array of vendors to provide it with services and equipment. malicious actors may attack vendors to disrupt the services they provide to sce, or to use those vendors as a cyber conduit to attack sce.
additionally, the equipment and material provided by sce's vendors may contain cyber vulnerabilities.
sce's systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to computer attacks of malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and other illicit activities, but to date, sce has not experienced a material cybersecurity breach. though sce actively monitors developments in this area and is involved in various industry groups and government initiatives, no security measures can completely shield its systems and infrastructure from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality.
if sce's information technology and operational technology systems' security measures were to be breached, or a critical system failure were to occur without timely recovery, sce could be unable to fulfill critical business functions, such as delivery of electricity to customers, and/or sensitive confidential personal and other data could be compromised, which could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, material financial loss to sce or to its customers, loss of confidence in sce's security measures, customer dissatisfaction, and significant litigation and/or regulatory exposure, all of which could materially affect sce's financial condition and results of operations and materially damage the business reputation of edison international and sce.

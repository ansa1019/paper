item 1a. risk factors risks relating to our business our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic and political conditions in the u.s. and elsewhere.
changes in economic and political conditions in the u.s. and other countries in which we are located or do business could have a material effect on our company. changes in such conditions have, in some periods, resulted in fewer miles driven, fewer accident claims, and a reduction of vehicle repairs, all of which could negatively affect our business. our sales are also impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners. the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.  many of these factors are outside of our control. if any of these conditions worsen, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
in addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions. these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we face intense competition from local, national, international, and internet-based vehicle products providers, and this competition could negatively affect our business.
the vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem, recycled, aftermarket, refurbished and remanufactured products. within each of these categories of suppliers, there are local owner-operated companies, larger regional suppliers, national and international providers, and internet-based suppliers. providers of vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle replacement products, which may further increase competition. some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise; greater financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution, and other resources; longer operating histories; lower cost structures; and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers, than we do. in certain regions of the u.s., local vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the wholesale recycled products industry. similarly in europe, some local companies
18
are part of cooperative efforts to compete in the aftermarket parts industry. as a result of these factors, our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply, provide their products at lower costs, or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve.
we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by oems, with the balance being supplied by distributors like us. the oems are therefore in a position to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace. we compete with the oems primarily on price and to a lesser extent on service and quality. from time to time, the oems have implemented programs seeking to increase their market share in the collision repair parts industry. for example, they have experimented with reducing prices on specific products to match the lower prices of alternative products and with other initiatives that may disrupt our sales. if such price reductions were to become widespread, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.
we rely upon our customers and insurance companies to promote the usage of alternative parts.
our success depends, in part, on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies. there can be no assurance that current levels of alternative parts usage will be maintained or will increase in the future. in addition, in some places we operate, alternative parts usage is relatively low. we also rely on business relationships with insurance companies. these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide. the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs. our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time, including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering, availability, standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs. we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops, and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company ("avery v. state farm"), a jury decided in october 1999 that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using non-oem replacement products to repair damaged vehicles when use of such products did not restore the vehicle to its "pre-loss condition." the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of non-oem replacement products and the alleged inferiority of those products. the jury assessed damages against state farm of $456 million, and the judge assessed an additional $730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act. in april 2001, the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by $130 million because of duplicative damage awards. on august 18, 2005, the illinois supreme court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found, among other things, that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract by state farm. the u.s. supreme court declined to hear an appeal of this case. as a result of this case, some insurance companies reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products. our financial results could be adversely affected if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled products from us due to a fear of similar claims.
in addition, to the extent that the collision repair industry continues to consolidate, the buying power of collision repair shop customers may further increase, putting additional pressure on our financial returns.
we may not be able to successfully acquire new businesses or integrate acquisitions, which could cause our business to suffer.
we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms, if we do not obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on applicable terms, or for other reasons. moreover, we may not be able to identify a sufficient number of acquisition candidates at reasonable prices to maintain our growth objectives. also, over time, we will likely seek to make acquisitions that are relatively larger as we grow. larger acquisition candidates may attract additional competitive buyers, which could increase our cost or could cause us to lose such acquisitions.
if we buy a company or a division of a company, we may experience difficulty integrating that company's or division's personnel and operations, which could negatively affect our operating results. in addition:
•the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us;
•customers of the acquired company may decide not to purchase products from us;
•suppliers of the acquired company may decide not to sell products to us;
•we may experience business disruptions as a result of information technology systems conversions;
•we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, and financial reporting;
•we may be held liable for environmental, tax or other risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence;
19
•we may intentionally assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire, which could result in material adverse affects on our business;
•our existing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention;
•we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated, either in the amount or in the time frame that we expect; and
•we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition, the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders.
claims by oems relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business.
oems and other manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims. the oems have brought such claims in federal court and with the u.s. international trade commission.
to the extent oems and other manufacturers are seeking and obtaining more design patents than they have in the past and are successful in asserting infringement of these patents and defending their validity, we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products, which could have an adverse effect on our business. we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims. in addition, aftermarket products certifying organizations may revoke the certification of parts that are the subject of the claims. lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization.
in december 2005 and may 2008, ford global technologies, llc filed complaints with the international trade commission against us and others alleging that certain aftermarket products imported into the u.s. infringed on ford design patents. the parties settled these matters in april 2009 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that expires in march 2020. in january 2014, chrysler group, llc filed a complaint against us in the u.s. district court in the eastern district of michigan contending that certain aftermarket parts we sell infringe chrysler design patents relating to the dodge ram pickup truck. the parties settled this matter in june 2014 pursuant to a patent license arrangement that expires in june 2019. in the event that these license arrangements, or other similar license arrangements with oems, are terminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms, we may be subject to costs and uncertainties of litigation as well as restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that replicate parts covered by design patents.
if the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines or the number of cars being repaired declines, our business could suffer.
our business depends on vehicle accidents and mechanical failures for both the demand for repairs using our products and the supply of recycled, remanufactured and refurbished parts. thus, our business is impacted by factors which influence the number and/or severity of accidents and mechanical failures including, but not limited to, the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, the ages of drivers, the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions, the congestion of traffic, the use of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers, the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers, the effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles, the reliability of new oem parts, and the condition of roadways. for example, an increase of the acceptance of the ride-sharing business model would reduce the number of vehicles on the road. additionally, an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline, as motorists seek alternative transportation options. mild weather conditions, particularly during winter months, tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents. moreover, a number of states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones or other electronic devices while driving, and such restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents.
systems designed to help drivers avoid accidents are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated. to the extent oems install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles, the number and severity of accidents could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from year-to-year.  periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance. substantial further declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. in addition, if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road, insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such vehicles or there could be less costly repairs. if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road, the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer, longer-lasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a vehicle's life. moreover, alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles.
20
fluctuations in the prices of metals and other commodities could adversely affect our financial results.
our recycling operations generate scrap metal and other metals that we sell. after we dismantle a salvage vehicle for wholesale parts and after vehicles have been used in our self service retail business, the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals. in addition, we receive "crush only" vehicles from other companies, including oems, which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals. the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated, sometimes significantly, due to market factors. in addition, buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply. to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals, our revenue from such sales will suffer and a write-down of our inventory value could be required. the cost of our wholesale recycled and our self service retail inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices. in a period of falling metal prices, there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline, and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions. the prices of steel, aluminum, and plastics are components of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business. if the price of commodities rise and result in higher costs to us for products we sell, we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers.
we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of aftermarket, recycled, refurbished or remanufactured products.
some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide, such as airbags. these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products. in addition, the federal trade commission (ftc) has issued guides which regulate the use of certain terms such as "rebuilt" or "remanufactured" in connection with the sale of automotive parts. restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations.
most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work and/or require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work. additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future. if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed, it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business. certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products. if these organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards, we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product. such events could adversely affect our business.
an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers or auction companies or a disruption to our supply of inventory could increase our expenses and impede our ability to serve our customers.
our business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products, a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan. we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers, many of which are located in asia. if the cost of freight rose we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers. furthermore, although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us, the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products.  in addition, we are subject to disruptions from work stoppages and other labor disputes at port facilities through which we import our inventory. moreover, our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad, including, among other things, natural disasters, transportation costs and delays, political instability, currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers (including changes in the allocation of quotas), as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china, japan and taiwan. because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal, we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. additionally, as manufacturers convert to raw materials other than steel, it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process.
most of our salvage and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions operated by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the u.s. we do not typically have contracts with the auction companies. according to industry analysts, a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market in the u.s. if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions, began competing with us, or significantly raised its fees, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers. moreover, we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors, rebuilders, exporters and others. to the extent that the number of bidders increases, it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products. some states regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers. auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce, circumvent or eliminate these
21
regulations, which would further increase the number of bidders. in addition, there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in the u.s. as we grow and our demand for salvage vehicles increases, the costs of these incremental vehicles could be higher.
we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies, oems, and others. to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers.
our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate.
our revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. future factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, those listed in the special note on forward-looking statements in this annual report on form 10-k. accordingly, our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance. these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below our published financial guidance and the expectations of public markets, which could cause our stock price or the value of our debt instruments to decline.
if we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives.
our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level. if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business.
we operate in foreign jurisdictions, which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks.
we have operations in belgium, canada, france, mexico, sweden, the netherlands, taiwan and the u.k., and we may expand our operations in these countries and into other countries. our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition, including import and export requirements and compliance with anti-corruption laws, such as the u.k. bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act. we also incur costs in currencies, other than our functional currencies, in the countries in which we operate. we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies, as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws. in addition, mexico is currently experiencing a heightened level of criminal activity that could affect our ability to maintain our supply of certain aftermarket products.
if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur significant charges to our pre-tax income.
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. in the future, goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions. goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses, increases in our cost of capital, adverse market conditions, and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business. as of december 31, 2015, our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was $2.3 billion. for further discussion of our annual impairment test, see "goodwill impairment" in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k.
we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives, each of which is based upon the expected period to be benefited. we review other intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we may record an impairment charge. as of december 31, 2015, the value of our other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, was $215 million.
our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor laws.
a small percentage of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiation. from time to time, there have been efforts to organize additional portions of our workforce and those efforts can be expected to continue. in addition, the u.s. department of labor or applicable foreign government agencies could adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations that could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful. also, we may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions. additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements, and work stoppages could materially increase our costs and reduce revenue and could limit our flexibility in terms of work schedules, reductions in force and other operational matters.
22
we also are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, such as the fair labor standards act, that govern such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions. some of these laws are technical in nature and could be subject to interpretation by government agencies different than our interpretations. efforts to comply with existing laws, changes to such laws and newly-enacted laws may increase our labor costs. if we were found not to be in compliance with such laws, we could be subject to fines, penalties and liabilities to our employees or government agencies.
we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business.
some of the information technology systems and communication systems we use for management of our facilities and our financial functions are leased from or operated by other companies, while others are owned by us. in the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us or if we suffer prolonged outages of these or our own systems for whatever reason, we could suffer disruptions to our operations.
in the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems, we may also suffer disruptions to our business. we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems, and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems. also, our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system, which period could extend longer than we anticipated.
our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and employees.  we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action.  the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.  there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations, the function of our computer systems, and/or the availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.
weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters, or the threat of any of them, may result in the closure of our distribution centers ("dc"s) or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis.  this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty.  some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states or into the other countries in which we operate, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices.  such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters.
we are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things: the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water; exposure to hazardous materials; and the generation, handling, storage, use, treatment, identification, transportation, and disposal of industrial by-products, waste water, storm water, and mercury and other hazardous materials. we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws, regulations, or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials.
under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at, or migration to or from, our or our predecessors' past or present facilities and at independent waste disposal sites. these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.
environmental laws are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls.
if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage, we could be subject to product liability claims by such customers. the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  in addition, we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective.  the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
23
we have agreed to defend and indemnify in certain circumstances insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls. the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.
governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits.
our operating subsidiaries in our salvage, self-service, and refurbishing operations must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations. when we develop or acquire a new facility, we must seek the approval of state and local units of government. governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities. there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold.
new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business.
in august 2012, as mandated by the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, the sec adopted final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the democratic republic of congo (drc) or adjoining countries. these new requirements impose significant burdens on u.s. public companies. compliance with the rules requires substantial due diligence in an effort to determine whether products contain the conflict minerals.  the results of such due diligence efforts must be disclosed on an annual basis in a filing with the sec.
our supply chain is complex and we may incur significant costs to determine the source of any such minerals used in our products. we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our diligence activities. further, the implementation of these rules and their effect on customer, supplier and/or consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering products free of conflict minerals in some circumstances, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement. accordingly, these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.
if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks, our business could be harmed.
we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell. we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services, including inclement weather, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, governmental regulation, availability and price of fuel, liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance, and insurance premium increases. in addition, our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
regulations that may be issued under the anti-car theft act could harm our business.
in 1992, congress enacted the anti-car theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles. the purpose of the law is to implement an electronic system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers and major automotive parts. in january 2009, the u.s. department of justice implemented the portion of the system to track and monitor vehicle identification numbers. the portion of the system that would track and monitor major automotive parts would require various entities, including automotive parts recyclers like us, to inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the part number for any "covered major part." the department of justice has not promulgated rules on this portion of the system, and therefore there has been no progress on the implementation of the system to track and monitor major automotive parts. however, if this system is fully implemented, the requirement to collect the information would place substantial burdens on automotive parts recyclers, including us, that otherwise would not normally exist. it would place similar burdens on repair shops, which may discourage the use of recycled products by such shops.
risks relating to our common stock and financial structure the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.
the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions.  the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts' expectations.  failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. in addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.  downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline.  additionally, the market price for our common stock has been in the past, and in the future may be,
24
adversely affected by allegations made or reports issued by short sellers, analysts or others regarding our business model, our management or our financial accounting.
following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.  if similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
delaware law, our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could affect the price of our stock.
the anti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our loan documents and delaware law could, together or separately, impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult. our credit agreement provides that a change of control is an event of default. our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition, takeover, or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the price of our common stock.
future sales of our common stock or other securities may depress our stock price.
we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock or other equity, debt or instruments which constitute an element of our debt and equity (collectively, "securities") in the future. we may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisitions. we cannot predict the size of future issuances of securities or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock or other securities will have on the price of our common stock. sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), the issuance of additional debt securities, or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur, may cause the price of our common stock to fall.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business.
as of december 31, 2015, we had $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding, including $480 million under our senior secured credit facilities, $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes due 2023, $410.6 million under our term loan, and $63 million under our accounts receivable securitization program. as of december 31, 2015, we also had $1.3 billion of undrawn availability (after giving effect to approximately $66 million of outstanding letters of credit) under our revolving credit facilities and $34 million of undrawn availability under our accounts receivable securitization program.
on january 29, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our senior secured credit facility to increase the capacity to $3.2 billion (composed of approximately $750 million in term loans and $2.45 billion in a multicurrency revolving credit line). the credit facility matures in january 2021.
our significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations, limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position.
for example, it could:
•   increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;
•   place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;
•   limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; and
•   increase our cost of borrowing.
in addition, if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt, the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase.
25
although we are subject to our senior secured credit facilities for so long as they remain in effect, the indenture that governs the senior notes does not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness, guarantees or other obligations. the indenture contains certain limitations on our ability to incur liens on assets, sell our assets, make dividends and distributions and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. however, these limitations are subject to important exceptions. in addition, the indenture does not contain many other restrictions, including certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities, including, without limitation, restrictions on investments, incurring indebtedness or prepaying subordinated indebtedness or engaging in transactions with our affiliates.
our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.
our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:
•incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness (including guarantees thereof);
•pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness;
•incur liens on assets;
•make certain investments or other restricted payments;
•engage in transactions with affiliates;
•sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies;
•guarantee indebtedness; and
•alter the business we conduct.
as a result of these covenants and restrictions, we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement. a default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of our debt, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. if this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. even if new financing were available, it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.
our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations. additionally, the senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that governs our senior notes limit the use of the proceeds from certain dispositions of our assets; as a result, our senior secured credit facilities and our senior notes may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all of our debt service obligations.
in addition, we are a holding company and repayment of our indebtedness is dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. unless they are borrowers or guarantors of the indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries
26
and, under certain circumstances, distributions from our subsidiaries may be subject to significant taxes that reduce the amount of such distributions available to us. in the event that we do not receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.
our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing, events that could have a negative effect on our business.
we may need to raise additional funds in the future to, among other things, refinance existing debt, fund our existing operations, improve or expand our operations, respond to competitive pressures, or make acquisitions. from time to time, we may raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic alliances, or other arrangements. funds may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us as a result of different factors, including but not limited to turmoil in the credit markets that results in the tightening of credit conditions and current or future regulations applicable to the financial institutions from whom we seek financing. if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively. if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests, and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock. if we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations. if we refinance or restructure our debt, we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing, or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations. in addition, there are restrictions in the indenture that governs our senior notes on our ability to refinance the notes prior to 2018. if we fail to raise capital when needed, our business may be negatively affected.
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly and could affect the value of our senior notes.
certain borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and the borrowing under our accounts receivable securitization facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. moreover, changes in market interest rates could affect the trading value of our senior notes.
a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our senior notes.
credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital. credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include, among other items, our results of operations, business decisions that we make, their view of the general outlook for our industry, and their view of the general outlook for the economy. actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading, or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. we believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates.  a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facilities.  a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our senior notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future or incur other indebtedness upon favorable terms.
the right to receive payments on the senior notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a security interest in our assets.
our obligations under the senior notes and our guarantors' obligations under their guarantees of the senior notes are unsecured, but our and each co-borrower's obligations under our senior secured credit facilities and each guarantor's obligations under their respective guarantees of the senior secured credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets, including the stock of most of our wholly-owned united states subsidiaries and the stock of certain of our non-united states subsidiaries. if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under our senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. if we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the senior notes, even if an event of default exists under the indenture governing the notes. furthermore, if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under the senior notes, then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the senior notes automatically and immediately upon such sale. in any such event, because the senior notes are not secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors, it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which claims by holders of the senior notes could be satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy claims fully.
united states federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the senior notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the senior notes and the guarantees, and require holders of the senior notes to return payments received from us or the guarantors.
our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are obligors under the senior secured credit facilities also guarantee the
27
obligations under the senior notes. our issuance of the senior notes and the issuance of the guarantees by the guarantors under the secured credit facilities and the senior notes may be subject to review under state and federal laws if a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit, including in circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved, were commenced at some future date by, or on behalf of, our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor. under the federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a court may avoid or otherwise decline to enforce the senior secured credit facilities, the senior notes or a guarantor's guarantee, or may subordinate the senior secured credit facilities, the senior notes or such guarantee to our or the applicable guarantor's existing and future indebtedness. while the relevant laws may vary from state to state, a court might do so if it found that when indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities was incurred, or the senior notes were issued, or when the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee, or, in some states, when payments became due under the senior secured credit facilities, the senior notes or such guarantee, the borrower, the issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and:
•   was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;
•was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or
•intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.
a court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the senior secured credit facilities, the senior notes or such guarantee if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the senior secured credit facilities or the issuance of the senior notes. the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. generally, however, a borrower, an issuer or a guarantor, as applicable, would be considered insolvent if:
•   the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of its assets;
•   the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or
•   it could not pay its debts as they become due.
a court might also void the senior secured credit facilities, the senior notes or a guarantee, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes were incurred or issued or the applicable guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors. in addition, any payment by us or a guarantor pursuant to the senior secured credit facilities, the senior notes or its guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor's creditors, and accordingly the court might direct the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or the holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts already received from us or such guarantor. although each guarantee contains a "savings clause" intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor's liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect any subsidiary guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law. furthermore, in official committee of unsecured creditors of tousa, inc. v citicorp north america, inc., the united states bankruptcy court in the southern district of florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause included in the documents relating to our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes was unenforceable. as a result, the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances. the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit recently affirmed the liability findings of the bankruptcy court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally. if the tousa decision were followed by other courts, the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased.
to the extent a court avoids the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes or any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes or any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or the holders of the senior notes, as the case may be, would cease to have any direct claim against us or the applicable guarantor. if a court were to take this action, our or the applicable guarantor's assets would be applied first to satisfy our or the applicable guarantor's other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes, as the case may be. sufficient funds to repay the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any.
not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our senior secured credit facilities or our senior notes, and the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries may not be available to make payments on such obligations.
not all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured credit facilities or the senior notes. in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves or otherwise winds up, holders of its indebtedness and its trade creditors generally will be entitled to payment on their claims from the assets of that subsidiary
28
before any of those assets are made available to the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or the holders of the senior notes. consequently, claims in respect of the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade payables, and any claims of third party holders of preferred equity interests, if any, in our non-guarantor subsidiaries. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our subsidiaries that are not borrowers under or do not guarantee the senior secured credit facilities and our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes represented approximately 33% and 26% of our total revenue and operating income, respectively. in addition, these non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 35% and 37% of our total assets and total liabilities, respectively, as of december 31, 2015 (excluding, in each case, intercompany amounts) with respect to both the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes. of these amounts, as of the same date, our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior secured credit facilities had approximately $543.5 million of outstanding indebtedness (which includes $480.5 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities by foreign subsidiaries that are borrowers under the revolving credit facilities but that do not guarantee the notes).
we may not be able to repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer.
upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes, the holders of the notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. such a change of control would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facilities. in order to obtain sufficient funds to pay amounts due under the senior secured credit facilities and the purchase price of the outstanding senior notes, we expect that we would have to refinance our indebtedness. we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance our indebtedness on reasonable terms, if at all. our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding senior notes or to purchase all validly tendered senior notes would be an event of default under the indenture. such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt. our other debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture.
the definition of change of control in the indenture governing the senior notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of "all or substantially all" of our assets. there is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. accordingly, the ability of a holder of senior notes to require us to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain.
in addition, in certain circumstances as specified in the indenture governing the senior notes, we will be required to commence an asset sale offer, as defined in the indenture, pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase certain senior notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds we receive from certain asset sales. our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer. in particular, our senior secured credit facilities contain provisions that require us, upon the sale of certain assets, to apply all of the proceeds from such asset sale to the prepayment of amounts due under the senior secured credit facilities. the mandatory prepayment obligations under the senior secured credit facilities will be effectively senior to our obligations to make an asset sale offer with respect to the senior notes under the terms of the indenture. our failure to purchase any such senior notes when required under the indenture would be an event of default under the indenture.
key terms of the senior notes will be suspended if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.
many of the covenants in the indenture governing the senior notes will be suspended if the notes are rated investment grade by standard & poor's and moody's provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, including those covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, incur liens and to enter into certain other transactions. there can be no assurance that the senior notes will ever be rated investment grade. however, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force (although provisions under our other debt, like the senior secured credit facilities, may continue to restrict us from engaging in these transactions), and the effects of any such transactions will be permitted to remain in place even if the senior notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade.
the liquidity and market value of the senior notes may change due to a variety of factors.
the liquidity of any trading market in the senior notes, and the market price quoted for the senior notes, may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for these types of securities, changes in interest rates, changes in our ratings, and changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industries generally.
we rely on an accounts receivable securitization program for a portion of our liquidity.
we have an arrangement whereby we sell an interest in a portion of our accounts receivable to a special purpose vehicle and receive funding through the commercial paper market. this arrangement expires in october 2017.  in the event that the market for commercial paper were to close or otherwise become constrained, our cost of credit relative to this program could rise, or credit could be unavailable altogether.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, as well as specialty vehicle products and accessories.
buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers ("oems"); new products produced by companies other than the oems, which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles; used products that have been refurbished; and used products that have been remanufactured. we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products, recycled collision and mechanical products, refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights, and remanufactured engines. collectively, we refer to these products as alternative parts because they are not new oem products.
we are the nation's largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states and canada. we are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in the united kingdom and the benelux region (belgium, netherlands, & luxembourg) of continental europe. in addition to our wholesale operations, we operate heavy duty truck facilities and self service retail facilities across the u.s. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life-vehicles. in 2014, we expanded our product offering to include specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories through the acquisition of keystone specialty.
we are organized into four operating segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; and self service. we aggregate our north american operating segments (wholesale - north america and self service) into one reportable segment, resulting in three reportable segments: north america, europe and specialty.
our revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, those listed in the special note on forward-looking statements in part i, item 1 and risk factors in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k. accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
acquisitions and investments since our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that are market leaders, will expand our geographic presence and enhance our ability to provide a wide array of automotive products to our customers through our distribution network.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we completed 18 acquisitions, including 4 wholesale businesses in north america and 12 wholesale businesses in europe, a self service retail operation, and a specialty vehicle aftermarket business. our wholesale business acquisitions in north america included partschannel, inc. ("parts channel"), an aftermarket collision parts distributor. the specialty aftermarket business acquired was the coast distribution system, inc. ("coast"), a supplier of replacement parts, supplies and accessories for the recreational vehicle ("rv") and outdoor recreation markets. our european acquisitions included 11 aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands, 9 of which were former customers of and distributors for our netherlands subsidiary, sator, and were acquired with the objective of expanding our distribution network in the netherlands. our other acquisitions completed in 2015 enabled us to expand our geographic presence.
on december 22, 2015, lkq and its wholly-owned subsidiary lkq italia s.r.l. entered into an agreement to acquire the holding company of rhiag-inter auto parts italia s.p.a ("rhiag"), a distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles in italy, czech republic, switzerland, hungary, romania, ukraine, bulgaria, slovakia, poland and spain. the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016 and is subject to customary closing conditions and necessary regulatory approvals. this acquisition will expand lkq's geographic presence in continental europe. we believe the acquisition will create potential purchasing synergies.
on january 3, 2014, we completed our acquisition of keystone specialty. keystone specialty is a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories in north america serving the following six product segments: truck and off-road; speed and performance; recreational vehicle; towing; wheels, tires and performance handling; and miscellaneous accessories. our acquisition of keystone specialty allowed us to enter into new product lines and increase the size of our addressable market. in addition, we believe that the acquisition creates logistics and administrative cost synergies and potential cross-selling opportunities.
35
in addition to our acquisition of keystone specialty, we made 22 acquisitions during 2014, including 9 wholesale businesses in north america, 9 wholesale businesses in europe, 2 self service retail operations, and 2 specialty vehicle aftermarket businesses. our european acquisitions included seven aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands, five of which were customers of and distributors for our netherlands subsidiary, sator. our acquisitions in the netherlands enabled us to transform the existing distribution model to better align with that of our u.k. operations. this realignment has allowed us to sell directly to the end repair shop customer versus through a local wholesale distributor, and to improve margins, customer service, and fulfillment rates, and positioned us well to introduce additional product categories in the long term. our other acquisitions completed during the year ended december 31, 2014 enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we completed 20 acquisitions, including our may 2013 acquisition of sator, a vehicle mechanical aftermarket parts distribution company based in the netherlands, with operations in the netherlands, belgium and northern france. with the acquisition of sator, we expanded our geographic presence in the european vehicle mechanical aftermarket products market into continental europe to complement our existing u.k. operations. in addition to our acquisition of sator, we acquired 10 wholesale businesses in north america, 7 wholesale businesses in europe and 2 self service operations. our european acquisitions included five automotive paint distribution businesses in the u.k., which enabled us to expand our collision product offerings. the other acquisitions completed during 2013 enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets.
in august 2013, we entered into an agreement with suncorp group, a leading general insurance group in australia and new zealand, to develop an alternative vehicle replacement parts business, acm parts pty ltd ("acm parts"), in those countries. as of december 31, 2015, this investment was classified as held for sale and included within other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. the sale of this investment was completed in february 2016. refer to note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" within the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to this investment.
sources of revenue we report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products and related services including (i) aftermarket, other new and refurbished products and (ii) recycled, remanufactured and related products and services. our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of extended warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and processing fees related to the secure disposal of vehicles. for the year ended december 31, 2015, parts and services revenue represented approximately 93% of our consolidated revenue.
the majority of our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops. in north america, our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors, hoods, and fenders; bumper covers; mirrors and grills; head and tail lamps; wheels; and large mechanical items such as engines and transmissions. in europe, our products include a wide variety of small mechanical products such as filters, belts and hoses, spark plugs, alternators and water pumps, batteries, suspension and brake parts, clutches, and oil and lubricants. the demand for these products is influenced by several factors, including the number of vehicles in operation, the number of miles being driven, the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents, the age profile of vehicles in accidents, seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions and the availability and pricing of new oem parts. with respect to collision related products, automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process. accordingly, we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our vehicle replacement products. while they are not our direct customers, we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process. such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates, direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program. we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of products for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers. there is no standard price for many of our vehicle replacement products, but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability, quality, demand, new oem product prices, the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained, competitor pricing and our product cost.
our revenue from aftermarket, other new and refurbished products also includes revenue generated from the sale of specialty aftermarket vehicle equipment and accessories. these products are primarily sold to a large customer base of specialty vehicle retailers and equipment installers, including mostly independent, single-site operators. specialty vehicle aftermarket products are typically installed on vehicles within the first year of ownership to enhance functionality, performance or aesthetics. as a result, the demand for these products is influenced by new and used vehicle sales and the overall economic health of vehicle owners, which may be affected by general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels
36
and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. the prices for our specialty vehicle products are based on manufacturers' suggested retail prices, with discounts applied based on prevailing market conditions, customer volumes and promotions that we may offer from time to time.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, revenue from other sources represented approximately 7% of our consolidated sales. these other sources include scrap sales and sales of aluminum ingots and sows. we derive scrap metal from several sources, including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of "crush only" vehicles. other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold.
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts, freight, and overhead costs related to the purchasing, warehousing and distribution of our inventory, including labor, facility and equipment costs and depreciation. our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors. our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for cores, freight, and costs to refurbish the parts, including direct and indirect labor, facility and equipment costs, depreciation and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations.
our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and, where applicable, auction, towing and storage fees. prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles, the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles, the number of vehicles designated as "total losses" by insurance companies, the production level of new vehicles (which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come), the age of vehicles at auction and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles. from time to time, we may also adjust our buying strategy to target vehicles with different attributes (for example, age, level of damage, and revenue potential). due to changes relating to these factors, we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time. our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles. our labor and labor-related costs related to acquisition and dismantling generally account for between 9% and 11% of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle. the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and, as a result, energy costs are not material. our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores; freight; and costs to remanufacture the products, including direct and indirect labor, facility and equipment costs, depreciation and other overhead related to our remanufacturing operations.
some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against defects. additionally, some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard three-year warranty against defects. we also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products that is supported by certain of the suppliers of those products. we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses.
other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations, and therefore, the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction, storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles. our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles, which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above.
expenses our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket warehouses, salvage yards and self service retail facilities. these costs include personnel expenses such as wages, incentive compensation and employee benefits for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel, as well as rent for our facilities and related utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance. the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and, as such, are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income.
our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers. included in our distribution expense category are personnel costs such as wages, employee benefits and incentive compensation for drivers; third party freight costs; fuel; and expenses related to our delivery and transfer trucks, including vehicle leases, repairs and maintenance and insurance.
our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary, commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel; advertising, promotion and marketing costs; credit card fees; telephone and other communication expenses; and bad debt expense. personnel costs generally account for between 75% and 80% of our selling and marketing expenses. most of our sales personnel are paid on a commission basis. the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability
37
to respond to our customers' needs and increase our sales volume. our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force, develop and implement training programs, and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness.
our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center, which provide management, treasury, accounting, legal, payroll, business development, human resources and information systems functions. general and administrative expenses include wages, benefits, stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation for corporate, regional and administrative personnel; information systems support and maintenance expenses; and accounting, legal and other professional fees.
seasonality our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. during the winter months, we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related accidents, which generate repairs. we expect our specialty vehicle operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year, when vehicle owners tend to install specialty products.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, business combinations, and goodwill impairment. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue. actual results may differ from these estimates.
revenue recognition we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle products when they are shipped to or picked up by the customers and title has transferred, subject to an allowance for estimated returns, discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information. in instances where a product is returned by a customer, the product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment. our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment. allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment. we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates. we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold. if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience, there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence.
we recognize revenue from the sale of scrap metal, other metals, and cores when title has transferred, which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer.
inventory accounting salvage and remanufactured inventory. our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle, including auction, towing and storage fees, as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles. inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility's inventory at expected selling prices, the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a part's days in stock and historical demand. the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility's historical profitability for salvage vehicles. remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores, and also includes expenses incurred for freight, direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations.
for all inventory, carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or market and is reduced to reflect current anticipated demand. if actual demand differs from our estimates, additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made.
business combinations we record our acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting, under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. we utilize management estimates and, in some instances, independent third-party valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted. such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions, including projections of future events and operating performance.

goodwill impairment we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually. when testing goodwill for impairment, we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value. if these assumptions or estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.
we are organized into four operating segments: wholesale-north america; europe; specialty; and self service. we have also concluded that these four operating segments are reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2015. we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist.
our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach. we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation.
during the quarter ended september 30, 2015, we noted that our north american operating margins continued to be negatively affected by the decline in scrap steel and other metals prices, which began in the fourth quarter of 2014. our self service reporting unit has been most impacted by the change in scrap steel prices as the sale of crushed car bodies comprises a relatively large percentage of its sales. it is anticipated that scrap steel prices will continue to have a negative impact on operating margins during 2016. given the decrease in scrap steel prices throughout 2015 and projected softness in 2016 and the corresponding negative effect on our current and expected results, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for the self service reporting unit as of august 31, 2015. based on the step one analysis performed for the self service reporting unit, no impairment adjustment was required. our forecasts assume scrap steel prices will continue at their current depressed level through all of 2016 before returning to our seven year historical average price of approximately $200 per ton in 2018. based on this forecast, the impairment test indicated the fair value of the self service reporting unit, determined using both market and income approaches, exceeded the reporting unit's carrying value by approximately 11%. declines in expected future cash flows (which are driven by scrap steel and other metals prices), reduction in terminal value growth rates, or an increase to the risk-adjusted discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the self service reporting unit may result in the determination that an impairment adjustment is required.
as of december 31, 2015, we had a total of $2.3 billion in goodwill subject to future impairment tests with approximately $259.0 million allocated to our self service reporting unit. we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2015 on all four reporting units. a 10% decrease in the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the annual impairment test would not have changed this determination, but the excess over carrying value for our self service reporting unit was 11% in the most recent test. if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments, we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results.

total revenue                     $7,192,633                      $6,740,064                     3.5       %             6.6       %               (3.4         )%              6.7        %
note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
the change in parts and services revenue of 10.3% represents increases of 6.8% in north america, 8% in europe, and 30.6% in specialty. the decline in other revenue of 26.7% primarily reflects the decline in the price of scrap steel and other metals. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue changes during 2015 compared to the prior year.
cost of goods sold. our cost of goods sold decreased to 60.6% of revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 from 60.7% of revenue in the prior year. the decrease is related to (i) a decline of 0.3% in costs of goods sold in our european operations, as a result of a 0.2% decrease in our u.k. operations due to lower product costs and 0.1% due to internalizing gross margin from our may 2014 acquisitions of seven netherlands distributors, and (ii) improved net pricing to customers in our north american operations; as our purchase costs were flat on average, the increase in revenue from favorable pricing resulted in a decrease of 0.2% in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. these decreases were offset by (i) an increase of 0.2% in our specialty operations due to higher inventory costs and unfavorable net customer pricing, and (ii) a negative mix effect of 0.3% primarily resulting from growth of our specialty segment from our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles, as this business yields lower gross margins than our north american and european segments. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the change in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
facility and warehouse expenses. as a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased to 7.7% from 7.8% in the prior year. compared to the prior year, we experienced a negative impact on operating leverage due to a decrease in other revenue, primarily as a result of declining prices of scrap steel and other metals. excluding the impact of the decline in scrap and other metal prices of 0.1%, facility and warehouse expenses would have improved by 0.2% primarily reflecting a positive mix effect as a greater proportion of revenue was generated from our specialty segment. compared to our north american operations, specialty stores a greater portion of inventory at their regional
40
distribution centers, the costs of which are capitalized into inventory and expensed through cost of goods sold. in our north american wholesale operations, most of the inventory sold by our local operations is stored on site rather than in distribution centers, and the related facility and warehouse expenses of the local operations are recorded in this line item.
distribution expenses. as a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased to 8.4% from 8.6% in the prior year. distribution expenses decreased by 0.4% compared to the prior year due to fuel cost savings driven by lower average prices. the decline in other revenue caused a 0.2% loss in operating leverage due to the revenue mix shift (scrap and other metals revenue has lower distribution costs than parts sales).
selling, general and administrative expenses. as a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased to 11.5% from 11.3% in the prior year. compared to the prior year, other revenue decreased as a result of declining prices of scrap steel and other metals, which negatively impacted our operating leverage and increased our selling, general and administrative expenses as percentage of revenue by 0.2%. excluding this impact, our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were flat over the prior year.
restructuring and acquisition related expenses. the following table summarizes restructuring and acquisition related expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2015                                                                                    2014                 change restructuring expenses                                   $13,083        (1)     $11,123        (2)      $1,960

total restructuring and acquisition related expenses     $19,511                $14,806                 $4,705
(1)   restructuring expenses of $10.5 million, $2.0 million, and $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 were primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses in our specialty, north america, and europe segments, respectively. these integration activities included the closure of duplicate facilities and termination of employees in connection with the integration of recent acquisitions into our existing business.
(2)   restructuring expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 included $5.8 million of expense related to the integration of our keystone specialty acquisition, as well as $1.9 million, $1.0 million, and $0.8 million of expense related to the integration of acquired businesses in our european, north american and specialty segments, respectively. additionally, we incurred $1.6 million of severance costs to terminated employees as part of the ongoing rationalization of our european operations.
(3)   acquisition related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 included $1.6 million for our acquisitions of eleven aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands and $0.2 million for other european acquisitions, $3.6 million for potential and pending acquisitions, and $1.0 million related to our north america and specialty acquisitions during the year.
(4)   acquisition related expenses for the prior year ended december 31, 2014 include external costs primarily related to our acquisitions of seven distribution companies in the netherlands.
see note 9, "restructuring and acquisition related expenses" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our restructuring and integration plans.
depreciation and amortization. the following table provides additional information about the increase in depreciation and amortization compared to the prior year (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2015                                                     2014                                 change depreciation                              $88,335                 $86,216                $2,119        (1)
amortization                               33,785                  34,503                  (718    )   (2)
total depreciation and amortization      $122,120                $120,719                $1,401
(1)   the increase in depreciation expense was a result of increased levels of property and equipment to support our acquisition and organic related growth, partially offset by a decline of $3.1 million attributable to the impact of foreign exchange rates.
(2)   the decrease in amortization expense reflects a $1.6 million decline due to foreign exchange rates partially offset by net increases in amortization expense for intangibles recorded related to our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions. the
41
amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 included accelerated amortization for intangibles recognized during 2014 for the january 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty.
other expense, net. the following table summarizes the components of the year-over-year increase in other expense, net (in thousands):
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2014             $61,980
increase (decrease) due to:
interest expense                                                     (6,682   )   (1)
loss on debt extinguishment                                            (324   )   (2)
changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities         2,305       (3)
interest and other income, net                                       (1,682   )   (4)
total decrease                                                       (6,383   )
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2015             $55,597
(1)   approximately $4.2 million of the reduction in interest expense from the prior year is due to lower outstanding borrowings. the remaining $2.5 million is attributable to lower interest rates under our senior secured credit agreement. the higher outstanding debt levels in the prior year were primarily related to borrowings used to finance the keystone specialty acquisition in january 2014 and cash flow from operations in 2015 that was used to pay down debt.
(2)   during the year ended december 31, 2014, we incurred a $0.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement. we did not incur a similar charge during 2015.
(3)   see note 6, "fair value measurements" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our contingent payment arrangements.
(4)   the increase in interest and other income, net reflects an increase in customer finance fees of $1.3 million and a favorable impact due to a decrease in foreign currency losses of $0.5 million, including the impact of unrealized mark-to-market losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the purchase of inventory and, to a lesser extent, unrealized and realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 33.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 34.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014. the lower effective tax rate in 2015 reflects a 0.5% benefit relative to the prior year as a result of an increase in earnings in our lower tax rate international operations. in addition, the effective tax rate for the current year benefited from discrete items, including favorable return to provision adjustments of $1.9 million and the favorable settlement of a canada tax matter totaling $1.8 million.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.0 million in our equity method investments. no tax benefit was recognized related to these charges. our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments totaled $4.1 million through the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $2.1 million during the prior year. with our divestiture of acm parts in february 2016, we expect our equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries to be nominal in 2016.
foreign currency impact. we translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. relative to the average rates used in 2014, the pound sterling, euro and canadian dollar rates used to translate the 2015 statements of income declined by 7.2%, 16.4%, and 13.5%, respectively. the translation effect of the decline of these currencies against the u.s. dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses for the year resulted in an approximately $0.04 negative effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
the change in parts and services revenue of 37.4% represents increases in segment revenue of 8.4% in north america, 46.6% in europe, and the addition of our specialty segment in 2014. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue growth during 2014 compared to the prior year.
cost of goods sold. our cost of goods sold increased to 60.7% of revenue in 2014 from 59.0% of revenue in 2013. the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of lower margins generated by certain of our acquired businesses, which increased cost of goods sold by 2.0% of revenue. our keystone specialty business operates a three step distribution model, which generates lower gross margins compared to our revenue from sales directly to repairers, and therefore was responsible for 1.2% of the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. our other acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year were responsible for the remainder of the acquisition impact on cost of goods sold, none of which had a material impact on our gross margins individually. partially offsetting the impact of our acquisitions, improvement in our north american gross margins decreased cost of goods sold by 0.4% of revenue. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold by segment for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
facility and warehouse expenses. as a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased to 7.8% from 8.4% in the prior year, which was primarily due to the effect of our keystone specialty acquisition. as discussed in our current year section, specialty operates with lower facility and warehouse expenses than our north american operations.
distribution expenses. as a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses increased to 8.6% in 2014 from 8.5% in 2013, primarily due to greater costs in our european segment. in our u.k. operations, we incurred greater personnel expenditures as a result of 59 new branch openings since the beginning of the prior year, which increased distribution expenses by 0.1% of revenue.
selling, general and administrative expenses. our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased to 11.3% of revenue from 11.8% of revenue in the prior year. our acquisitions contributed 0.4% of the reduction in expense, including primarily the effect of keystone specialty, which has lower selling, general and administrative costs compared to our other operations. greater leverage of our sales force and general and administrative personnel in our north american operations contributed an additional 0.3% improvement in costs as a percentage of revenue. these reductions in expense as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by greater expenses in our european operations, including greater expenditures for our sales force, primarily related to new branch openings, and higher advertising costs compared to the prior year period, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 0.2% of revenue.

depreciation and amortization. the following table provides additional information about the increase in depreciation and amortization compared to the prior year (in thousands):
year ended december 31,
2014                                                     2013                               change depreciation                              $86,216               $67,122               $19,094        (1)
amortization                               34,503                13,847                20,656        (2)
total depreciation and amortization      $120,719               $80,969               $39,750
(1)   the increase in depreciation is a result of increased levels of property and equipment to support our organic and acquisition related growth.
(2)   the increase in amortization is a result of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year. we recognized $78.1 million of intangibles related to our january 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty and $45.3 million of intangibles related to our may 2013 acquisition of sator.
other expense, net. the following table summarizes the components of the year-over-year increase in other expense, net (in thousands):
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2013             $54,353
increase (decrease) due to:
interest expense                                                     13,358       (1)
loss on debt extinguishment                                          (2,471   )   (2)
changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities        (4,355   )   (3)
interest and other income, net                                        1,095       (4)
net increase                                                          7,627
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2014             $61,980
(1)   interest expense increased $17.8 million as a result of higher average outstanding debt levels, primarily to finance our keystone specialty and 2014 european acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of $4.4 million as a result of lower interest rates relative to the prior year, primarily due to a lower applicable margin on our credit agreement borrowings as a result of our march 2014 amendment.
(2)   in 2014, we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million related to the march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement, compared to a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.8 million during the prior year related to our may 2013 amendment to our senior secured credit credit agreement.
(3)   during 2014, we recorded gains of $1.9 million as a result of fair value adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities, compared to losses of $2.5 million in the prior year. see note 6, "fair value measurements" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our contingent payment arrangements.
(4)   interest and other income, net decreased primarily due to $0.9 million of greater losses as a result of foreign currency exchange for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
see note 4, "long-term obligations" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the amendments to our credit agreement.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 34.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 34.5% for the year ended december 31, 2013. the lower effective income tax rate in 2013 primarily reflects the discrete benefit related to the revaluation of our net u.k. deferred tax liabilities as a result of reductions in the u.k. corporate income tax rate.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments totaled $2.1 million through the year ended december 31, 2014. net operating losses during the year ended december 31, 2013 were not material.
44
foreign currency impact. we translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. relative to the average rates used in 2013, the canadian dollar and euro rates used to translate the 2014 statements of income declined by 6.8% and 0.5%, respectively and the pound sterling rate increased by 5.3%. the translation effect of the change in these currencies against the u.s. dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses for the year resulted in approximately a $0.01 positive effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year.
45
results of operations-segment reporting we have four operating segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; and self service. our specialty operating segment was formed with our january 3, 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty, as discussed in note 8, "business combinations" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. our wholesale - north america and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment, north america, because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services, customers, and methods of distribution. therefore, we present three reportable segments: north america, europe and specialty.
we evaluate growth and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. the constant currency presentation, which is a non-gaap ("generally accepted accounting principles") measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. constant currency segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year segment ebitda in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. this non-gaap measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap. our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.
the following table presents our financial performance, including third party revenue, total revenue and segment ebitda, by reportable segment for the periods indicated (in thousands):

the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, is segment ebitda. segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. segment ebitda is calculated as ebitda excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. ebitda, which is the basis for segment ebitda, is calculated as net income excluding depreciation, amortization, interest (including loss on debt extinguishment) and taxes. loss on debt extinguishment is considered a component of interest in calculating ebitda, as the write-off of debt issuance costs is similar to the treatment of debt issuance cost amortization. see note 13, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a reconciliation of total segment ebitda to net income.

north america third party revenue. the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our north american segment (in thousands):
year ended december 31,                                                                                  percentage change in revenue north america                                  2015                          2014               organic                   acquisition (1)             foreign exchange             total change parts &amp; services revenue      $3,671,595                    $3,437,821                   5.6      %     (2      )       2.2         %              (1.0         )%             6.8        %
other revenue                        474,403                       650,880                 (28.8     )%     (3      )       2.0         %              (0.3         )%           (27.1       )%
total revenue                     $4,145,998                    $4,088,701                   0.1      %                     2.2         %              (0.9         )%             1.4        %
note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the acquisition growth in revenue reflects the impact of 13 wholesale businesses and 3 self service retail operations acquired since the beginning of 2014 up to the one year anniversary of the acquisition date.
(2)   approximately 60% of our organic growth in parts and services revenue was due to increased net pricing in our wholesale operations. in our aftermarket operations, we increased our net prices to customers compared to the prior year. in our salvage operations, we shifted our salvage vehicle purchasing to higher quality vehicles beginning in the third quarter of 2014, which increased the average revenue per part sold during 2015. the remainder of our organic growth in parts and services revenue was primarily due to increased sales volumes in our salvage operations and to a lesser extent, our aftermarket operations.
(3)   approximately $161 million of the $187 million organic decline in other revenue was a result of lower prices received from the sale of scrap and other metals. this was primarily due to lower prices from the sale of crushed auto bodies, which fluctuate based on steel prices. lower sales volumes were responsible for the remaining decline, primarily due to fewer vehicles processed relative to the prior year.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $3.5 million, or 0.6%, in 2015 compared to the prior year. the decline in scrap steel and other metals prices as described in the revenue section above had a negative year over year impact of $34.4 million on north american segment ebitda and a $0.07 negative effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year.
the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our north american segment:
north america                                                                        percentage of total segment revenue segment ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2014                                          13.3                      %
increase (decrease) due to:
change in gross margin                                                                        0.4                      %                    (1)
change in segment operating expenses                                                         (0.5                     )%                    (2)
segment ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2015                                          13.2                      %
note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the improvement in gross margin reflects a 0.2% favorable impact from our aftermarket product lines and a 0.1% favorable mix impact resulting from more revenue being derived from our wholesale operations, which have higher gross margin percentages relative to our self service operations during periods when scrap and other metal prices decline. in our aftermarket products, we improved our gross margin through increases in net prices to our customers. despite the continued decline in scrap and other metal prices, margins in our self service operations have remained consistent year over year, resulting from the continued effort to reduce car costs and purchase higher quality cars that will yield more parts revenue per vehicle to offset the loss in scrap and other metal revenue.
(2)   the decline in segment ebitda margin related to operating expenses was primarily the result of the negative impact on operating leverage caused by the decrease in other revenue related to the declining prices of scrap steel and other metals. in periods of falling scrap revenue, we do not experience a commensurate decline in operating expenses, as we
47
have few variable costs associated with the sale of scrap and other metals. the 0.5% increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue included an unfavorable impact of 1.1% related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals. this increase was partially offset by an improvement in segment operating expenses of 0.6%, which is primarily the result of a 0.4% improvement in distribution expenses due to a reduction in fuel costs.
europe third party revenue. the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our european segment (in thousands):
year ended december 31,                                                                                    percentage change in revenue europe                                          2015                            2014             organic (1)             acquisition (2)              foreign exchange (3)              total change parts &amp; services revenue      $1,991,106                      $1,843,730                     9.2       %               8.5         %                 (9.7           )%              8.0        %

total revenue                     $1,995,385                      $1,846,155                     9.3       %               8.6         %                 (9.7           )%              8.1        %
note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   in our u.k. operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 11.8%, while in our continental european operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 2.8%, resulting in net organic revenue growth of 9.2% over the prior year. our organic revenue growth in the u.k., which resulted from higher sales volumes, was composed of a 7.5% increase in revenue from stores open more than 12 months and a 4.3% increase from revenue generated by 54 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year through the one year anniversary of their respective opening dates. organic revenue growth in our continental european operations was primarily due to the opening of a new warehouse location in france in 2014 and, to a lesser extent, growth in our belgian market.
(2)   acquisition related growth for the year-ended december 31, 2015 includes $158.1 million from our acquisitions of 18 distribution companies in the netherlands since the beginning of 2014 and the purchase of a salvage business in sweden through the one year anniversary of the acquisitions.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $179.8 million, or 9.7%, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against both the pound sterling and euro relative to 2014.

(1)   organic growth in specialty parts and services revenue reflects increased sales volumes as a result of favorable economic conditions.
(2)   acquisition related growth reflects the impact of two specialty businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well as the acquisition of coast on august 19, 2015.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by 1.9%, primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian dollar in 2015 compared to the prior year.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   the decline in gross margin reflects a 0.7% increase in inventory costs, most of which we expect to be temporary as integration plans are completed, and a decrease in gross margin of 0.4% due to unfavorable net customer pricing. our acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles resulted in a 0.4% decline in gross margin compared to the prior year. compared to our existing specialty business, this acquisition realizes lower gross margins than our other specialty product sales. these negative effects on gross margin were partially offset by a favorable mix effect of 0.2% resulting from a shift toward higher margin product lines, particularly truck and off road products.
(2)   reflects a 0.8% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue related to (i) a 0.6% decline in personnel expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of integration synergies and (ii) a reduction in professional fees and advertising expenses of 0.2%. distribution expenses decreased 0.7% due to (i) favorable fuel pricing compared to the prior year of 0.6%, (ii) logistics synergies as we leverage our north american distribution network for the delivery of specialty products of 0.5%, partially offset by (iii) higher freight costs of 0.4% driven by higher use of third party freight to handle increased volumes, as well as sales related to our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles and our 2015 acquisition of coast, which are all shipped via third party carriers. we expect to realize additional integration synergies throughout 2016 as we continue to rationalize our facilities within this segment.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   reflects the impact of 9 wholesale businesses and 2 self service retail operations acquired during 2014.
(2)   our organic growth in parts and services revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes, as severe winter weather conditions during the second half of the fourth quarter of 2013 and through the first quarter of 2014 contributed to increased vehicle accidents, resulting in higher insurance claims activity. in addition, we believe the increased new car production since 2009 and greater miles driven has increased the demand for automotive parts used in repairs, including alternative parts. industry reports also indicate that the number of parts used in each insured repair is increasing compared to historical levels.
(3)   approximately half of the reduction in other revenue was due to reduced volume of scrap and other metals, with the remaining decline a result of lower prices for scrap and other metals. compared to the prior year, our furnace operations processed lower volumes of aluminum. additionally, we purchased fewer self service and "crush only" cars in the first quarter of 2014 as the prices demanded for vehicles in certain markets exceeded our acceptable cost given the prices of scrap and other metals. while we increased our purchasing levels during the remainder of the year to offset the shortfall, we crushed fewer vehicles compared to the prior year period due to the lag time to process these cars.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $57.1 million, or 11.7%, in 2014 compared to the prior year. the decline in scrap steel and other metals prices as described in the revenue section above had a negative year over year impact of $9.6 million on north american segment ebitda and a $0.02 negative effect on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   our wholesale operations increased gross margin by 0.6%, including a 0.5% improvement from lower inventory purchase costs and a favorable mix effect of 0.2% as a result of generating less revenue from our lower margin sales of scrap and precious metals. the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of an automotive core business in january 2014, which increased our revenue in product lines that are complementary to our existing vehicle replacement parts offerings but generate lower gross margins, thereby decreasing gross margins by 0.5% of revenue.
(2)   selling, general and administrative expenses declined by 0.5% of revenue, primarily due to improved leverage of our
50
sales force and general and administrative personnel, but this was partially offset by an increase of facility and warehouse expenses by 0.2% of revenue due to higher personnel expenditures.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   in our u.k. operations, revenue grew organically by 20.6%, while our continental european operations were flat with the prior year post-acquisition period, resulting in net organic revenue growth of 16.1% over the prior year. our organic revenue growth in the u.k., which resulted from higher sales volumes, was composed of a 13.3% increase from stores open more than 12 months and a 7.3% increase from revenue generated by 59 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year through the one year anniversary of their respective opening dates. in our continental european operations, a new warehouse location in france resulted in greater sales volumes compared to the prior year period, but this growth was offset by a decline in sales into eastern europe as a result of the devaluation of local currencies and political instability.
(2)   includes $131.3 million from our may 2013 acquisition of sator, $85.6 million from our august 2013 acquisitions of five paint distributors in the u.k. and $100.3 million from our 2014 acquisitions of seven distribution companies in the netherlands.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates contributed 3.6% of the revenue growth, primarily due to the strengthening of the british pound against the u.s. dollar in the first nine months of 2014. while exchanges rates positively affected revenue on a year-to-date basis, the british pound weakened against the u.s. dollar in the fourth quarter to partially offset the benefit realized during the first nine months of the year.
segment ebitda. segment ebitda increased $25.4 million, or 17.9%, in 2014 compared to the prior year. our european segment ebitda includes a positive year over year impact of $6.3 million related to the strengthening of the pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar in 2014. on a constant currency basis (i.e. excluding the translation impact), segment ebitda increased by $19.1 million, or 13.5%, compared to the prior year. refer to the foreign currency impact discussion within the results of operations - consolidated section above for further detail regarding the foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2014. the following table summarizes the changes in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue in our european segment:

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)   our acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year were responsible for 1.1% of the decline in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue, including primarily the effect of the netherlands distributors we acquired in may 2014. the effect of the netherlands distributors includes a negative gross margin impact of 0.3% that will not affect future periods once the higher cost acquired inventory has turned and we are able to internalize the incremental
51
distributor margin. additionally, as we transition our continental european operations to a two step distribution model, including the effect of these acquisitions, our operating expenses will increase as we internalize the cost of the distribution network; during the year ended december 31, 2014, these greater operating costs resulted in a decline in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue, thereby accounting for the remaining negative impact on segment ebitda margins. our existing operations were responsible for the remaining decline in segment ebitda, including a 0.7% effect from 59 new branch openings in the u.k. since the beginning of the prior year in our u.k. operations. additionally, we incurred 0.2% in higher advertising expenses compared to the prior year.
specialty because our specialty segment was formed on january 3, 2014 with our keystone specialty acquisition, the discussion of our consolidated results of operations covers the factors driving the year-over-year performance of our existing business and also discusses the effect of the specialty operations on our consolidated results. compared to keystone specialty's unaudited results for the year ended december 31, 2013, revenue in our specialty segment increased 15.8%. during the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed two additional acquisitions in our specialty segment, which contributed approximately one quarter of the revenue growth. the remaining revenue growth was primarily due to greater sales volumes as a result of favorable economic conditions. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2014, we generated a greater proportion of revenue from our higher-end specialty vehicle products, such as truck and rv accessories, which resulted in a favorable mix of revenue compared to the prior year unaudited results.
2016 outlook we estimate that adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31, 2016, excluding the impact of any restructuring and acquisition related expenses, amortization expense related to acquired intangibles and any gains or losses related to acquisitions or divestitures (including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities), will be in the range of $490 million to $520 million and $1.59 to $1.69, respectively.

(1) debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs of $15.0 million and $18.4 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively).
(2) includes our revolving credit facilities, our receivables securitization facility, and letters of credit. the amounts do not reflect the impact of the amendment to our senior secured credit facility on january 29, 2016.
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions. our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities. we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures, with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt. as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities. to fund our acquisitions, we have accessed various forms of debt financing, including our march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of $600 million of senior notes in may 2013.
as of december 31, 2015, we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing, as follows:
52
•   senior secured credit facilities maturing in may 2019, composed of $450 million in term loans ($411 million outstanding at december 31, 2015) and $1.85 billion in revolving credit ($480 million outstanding at december 31, 2015), bearing interest at variable rates (although a portion of this debt is hedged through interest rate swap contracts)
•   senior notes totaling $600 million, maturing in may 2023 and bearing interest at a 4.75% fixed rate
•   receivables securitization facility with availability up to $97 million ($63 million outstanding as of december 31, 2015), maturing in october 2017 and bearing interest at variable commercial paper rates on january 29, 2016, lkq corporation, lkq delaware llp, and certain other subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement to (1) extend the maturity date by approximately two years to january 29, 2021; (2) increase the total availability under the credit agreement from $2.3 billion to $3.2 billion (composed of $2.45 billion in the revolving credit facility's multicurrency component; and $750 million of term loans, which consist of a term loan of approximately $500 million and a €230 million term loan); (3) increase our ability to incur additional indebtedness; and (4) make other immaterial or clarifying modifications and amendments to the terms of the third amended and restated credit agreement. see note 4, "long-term obligations" within the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to our long-term obligations.
from time to time, we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity, such as our january 2016 amendment to our senior secured credit facilities and our september 2014 amendment to our receivables securitization facility. our financing structure, which includes our senior secured credit facilities, senior notes, and receivables securitization facility, provides financial flexibility to execute our long-term growth strategy. if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity, we have the ability to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our then-available liquidity.
as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.3 billion available under our credit facilities. combined with approximately $87.4 million of cash and equivalents at december 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.4 billion in available liquidity, an increase of $182.6 million over our available liquidity as of december 31, 2014.
after giving effect to the january 2016 amendment, we will have an additional $600 million of availability under our revolving credit facilities and an increase in term loan borrowings of approximately $339 million which, combined with our existing capacity, will be used to finance the potential rhiag acquisition. total consideration transferred for the purchase price is expected to include approximately $616 million of cash and approximately $500 million in assumed debt. we plan to refinance the assumed debt with revolver borrowings under our secured credit facility and/or other long term obligations. additional amounts are expected to be transferred for acquisition related costs.
we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements, although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size. while we believe that with the amended credit facility we have adequate capacity, from time to time, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. there can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our credit facilities, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs. our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates, which depend on the currency and the duration of the borrowing, plus an applicable margin rate which is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio. we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings (as described in note 5, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k), with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts. after giving effect to these interest rate swap contracts, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31, 2015 was 1.76%. including the borrowings on our senior notes and receivables securitization program, our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 2.89% at december 31, 2015. cash interest payments were $54.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, including interest payments totaling $28.5 million related to our senior notes. the semi-annual interest payments on our senior notes are made in may and november each year, and began in november 2013. we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of $0.9 billion and $1.1 billion at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. of these amounts, $22.5 million were classified as current maturities at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014.
under the terms of the january 2016 amendment, we have scheduled repayments of $3.1 million for the fiscal quarters ending on june 30, 2016, september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2016, and $6.2 million each fiscal quarter thereafter through the maturity of the usd term loan maturity in january 2021. we also have scheduled repayments of €1.4 million for the fiscal quarters ending on june 30, 2016, september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2016, and €2.9 million each fiscal quarter thereafter
53
through the maturity of the euro term loan in january 2021. we have no other significant principal payments on our credit facilities scheduled prior to the maturity of the receivables securitization program in october 2017. in addition to the repayments under our credit facilities, we will make payments on notes payable and other debt totaling $35.0 million in the next 12 months.
our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions. the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants, including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31, 2015.
as of december 31, 2015, the company had cash of $87.4 million, of which $59.4 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. we consider the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and accordingly no provision for u.s. income taxes has been provided thereon. should these earnings be repatriated in the future, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both u.s. income taxes (subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits) and potential withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the u.s. without resort to repatriation of foreign earnings.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared to year ended december 31, 2014
the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms, depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms. we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles.
the following table sets forth a summary of our aftermarket inventory procurement for 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):

(1)   in north america, we accelerated our aftermarket inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 in anticipation of potential labor issues at west coast ports in the u.s., leading to growth in the year-end inventory balance. as a result, our aftermarket inventory purchases in the first half of 2015 fell below 2014 levels. during the second half of 2015, we increased our aftermarket inventory purchases above the prior year levels as a result of an increase in sales and the depletion of the inventory acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014. our july 2015 acquisition of parts channel also contributed to the increase in purchases in the second half of 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our north american purchases were $38.1 million higher than the prior year.
(2)   in our european segment, our acquisitions of the netherlands distributors in 2014 and 2015 contributed incremental inventory purchases of $49.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. purchases for our u.k. operations increased in 2015 compared to the prior period primarily as a result of opening five new regional distribution centers. however, the greater purchase levels in europe were partially offset by the devaluation of the pound sterling and euro compared to the prior year period.
(3)   the increase in specialty aftermarket inventory purchases of $163.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, was related to accelerated inventory purchases to stock two new distribution centers scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2016. our august 2015 acquisition of coast and our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of parts for recreational vehicles also contributed to the increase in purchases compared to prior year period.
the following table sets forth a summary of our salvage and self service procurement for 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):

54
(1)   the increase in our salvage car and truck purchases is primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of purchasing activity related to our november 2014 acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in sweden and norway.
(2)   compared to the prior year, we reduced our purchases of lower cost self service and "crush only" cars as prices demanded for vehicles in certain markets exceeded our acceptable cost given the prices of scrap and other metals. the decrease in purchases was partially offset by the acquisition of a self service yard operation in 2015.
net cash provided by operating activities totaled $529.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $370.9 million in 2014. compared to the prior year, our 2015 ebitda increased by $52.9 million, due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth. cash outflows for our primary working capital accounts (receivables, inventory and payables) totaled $72.7 million during 2015 compared to $189.8 million during 2014. in 2015, cash outflows for inventory totaled $83.2 million as a result of inventory growth, particularly in our specialty operations; cash outflows for inventory were $122.6 million in the prior year. as discussed above, we increased our north american aftermarket inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 in anticipation of port issues in the u.s., which resulted in a larger cash outflow in the prior year as compared to 2015. accounts receivable represented a cash inflow of $14.7 million in 2015 compared to a cash outflow of $61.7 million in 2014. in europe, our netherlands operations experienced a reduction in accounts receivable in 2015 as result of a higher rate of collections due to the implementation of an automatic payment program. in the prior year, receivables balances increased primarily as a result of increased sales levels in our u.k. operations. cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control. however, we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we grow our business each year.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $330.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $921.0 million in 2014. we invested $160.5 million of cash, net of cash acquired, in business acquisitions during 2015, compared to $775.9 million for business acquisitions in 2014, which included $427.1 million for our keystone specialty acquisition. property and equipment purchases were $170.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $141.0 million in the prior year. the increase in capital expenditures relative to the prior year period reflects an increase of $33.0 million in our u.k. operations primarily due to costs incurred to develop and equip a new distribution center. during 2015, cash provided by other investing activities, net was $1.0 million and primarily consisted of proceeds from disposals of fixed assets totaling $10.7 million, partially offset by payments of $9.7 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, including a $7.5 million payment to increase our investment in acm parts. during 2014, we paid $2.2 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.
net cash used in financing activities totaled $224.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to an inflow of $519.0 million in 2014. during 2015, net repayments under our credit facilities were $186.5 million compared to net borrowings of $578.4 million in 2014. compared to the prior year period, our cash investment in acquisitions was lower, and therefore, we used the excess cash generated by operations to repay outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facilities. during 2014, we used the proceeds from the net borrowings primarily to fund acquisitions, including $370 million of revolver borrowings and $80 million of borrowings under our receivables facility to finance the keystone specialty acquisition. our march 2014 amendment of our credit facilities generated $11.3 million in additional term loan borrowings, which were used to pay $3.7 million in debt issuance costs related to the amendment, as well as to repay outstanding revolver borrowings. during 2014, we made a payment of $44.8 million ($39.5 million included in financing cash flows and $5.3 million included in operating cash flows) for the final earnout period under the contingent payment agreement related to our 2011 ecp acquisition. cash generated from exercises of stock options provided $8.2 million and $9.3 million in the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the excess tax benefit from share-based payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by $14.4 million and $17.8 million in the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we paid $7.6 million and $0.4 million related to taxes for net share settlements of stock-based compensation in the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid $12.6 million related to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts; no such payment occurred in 2015.

(1)   in north america, we increased our aftermarket inventory purchases above the prior year levels as a result of an increase in sales. additionally, we accelerated our aftermarket inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 in anticipation of potential labor issues at west coast ports in the u.s., leading to an increase in the year-end inventory balance compared to 2013.
(2)   in our european segment, our acquisitions of five netherlands distributors in 2014 contributed incremental inventory purchases of $63.5 million. our ecp operations contributed incremental inventory purchases of $146.4 million as a result of opening 44 new branches in 2014 and the appreciation of the pound sterling compared to 2013.
(3)   our specialty operating segment was formed with our january 3, 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty, as discussed in note 8, "business combinations." total purchases in 2014 include both keystone specialty and our october 2014 acquisition of a supplier of replacement parts, supplies and accessories for rvs.

net cash provided by operating activities totaled $370.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $428.1 million in 2013. compared to the prior year, our 2014 ebitda increased by $159.6 million, due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth. cash outflows for our primary working capital accounts (receivables, inventory and payables) increased to $189.8 million during 2014, from $64.3 million during 2013, as a result of greater inventory growth, particularly in our aftermarket products, as well as increased receivables balances, including the effect of increased sales levels in our u.k. operations. cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control. however, we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we grow our business each year. cash paid for income taxes increased to $177.0 million from $110.9 million due to the overpayment of taxes in 2012 that we offset against the estimated tax payments in 2013, as well as greater earnings that required higher estimated tax payments in 2014 compared to the prior year. during 2014, we made two semi-annual interest payments totaling $28.5 million on our senior notes, whereas in 2013 we made one semi-annual interest payment of $14.2 million. cash payments for bonuses were $7.8 million higher during 2014 than they were in 2013.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $921.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $505.6 million for the same period of 2013.we invested $775.9 million of cash, net of cash acquired, in business acquisitions during 2014, including $427.1 million for our keystone specialty acquisition. we invested $408.4 million for business acquisitions in the comparable prior year, including our acquisition of sator for $272.8 million. property and equipment purchases were $141.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $90.2 million in the prior year. the increase in capital expenditures relative to the prior year period reflects an increase of $17.4 million in our u.k. operations, including greater expenditures for leasehold improvements and vehicles for 44 new branch locations opened during the year ended december 31, 2014. capital expenditures in our north american segment increased by $19.9 million, primarily due to costs incurred to build a facility that we subsequently sold and leased back from the buyer. the proceeds of the sale-leaseback transaction are reflected as financing cash inflows in the year ended december 31, 2014. in 2013, we entered into an agreement with suncorp group to develop an alternative vehicle products business in australia and new zealand, for which our initial investment totaled $9.1 million; during 2014, we paid $2.2 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.
56
net cash provided by financing activities totaled $519.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $165.9 million in 2013. during 2014, net borrowings under our credit facilities were $578.4 million compared to net borrowings of $227.1 million in 2013. in both periods, we used the proceeds from the net borrowings primarily to fund acquisitions, including borrowings to finance our acquisition of keystone specialty in 2014 and our acquisition of sator in 2013. during 2013, we completed a $600 million senior notes offering, as well as an amendment to our credit agreement that resulted in $35 million in term loan proceeds, which were used to pay $16.9 million in debt issuance costs as well as to repay outstanding amounts on our revolving credit facilities. in march 2013, we made a payment of $33.9 million ($31.5 million included in financing cash flows and $2.4 million included in operating cash flows) for the 2012 earnout period under the contingent payment agreement related to our 2011 ecp acquisition; we made a similar payment of $44.8 million in 2014 ($39.5 million included in financing cash flows and $5.3 million included in operating cash flows) for the final earnout period. cash generated from exercises of stock options provided $9.3 million and $15.4 million in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the excess tax benefit from share-based payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by $17.8 million and $18.3 million in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid $12.6 million related to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts.
we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers, processing and sales facilities, and warehouses, through further integration of our facilities, and through selected business acquisitions. our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts, the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions.
2016 outlook we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2016, excluding business acquisitions, will be between $170 million and $180 million. we expect to use these funds for the development of a new distribution center in the u.k., several major facility expansions, improvement of current facilities, real estate acquisitions and systems development projects. we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 will be between $520 million and $550 million off-balance sheet arrangements and future commitments we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item 303 of regulation s-k under the securities exchange act of 1934. additionally, we do not have any synthetic leases.

(1)   our long-term debt under contractual obligations above includes interest on the balances outstanding as of december 31, 2015. the long-term debt balance excludes debt issuances costs as these expenses have already been paid. interest on our senior notes, notes payable, and other long-term debt is calculated based on the respective stated rates. interest on our variable rate credit facilities is calculated based on the weighted average rates, including the impact of interest rate swaps through their respective expiration dates, in effect for each tranche of borrowings as of december 31, 2015. future estimated interest expense for the next year, one to three years, and three to five years is $45.2 million, $88.2 million and $69.5 million, respectively. estimated interest expense beyond five years is $71.9 million.
(2)   interest on capital lease obligations is included based on incremental borrowing or implied rates. future estimated interest expense for the next year, one to three years, and three to five years is $0.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively. estimated interest expense beyond five years is $8.2 million.
(3)   the operating lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. historically, these expenses have averaged approximately 25% of the corresponding lease payments.
(4)   our purchase obligations include open purchase orders for aftermarket inventory.
(5)   our contingent consideration liabilities reflect the undiscounted estimated payments of additional consideration related to business combinations. the actual payments will be determined at the end of the applicable performance periods based on the acquired entities' achievement of the targets specified in the purchase agreements.
(6)   includes asset purchase commitments related to the construction of a new distribution center for our u.k. operations, commitments to purchase land and buildings, it related expenditures, and other asset purchase commitments.
(7)   self-insurance reserves include undiscounted estimated payments, net of estimated insurance recoveries, for our employee medical benefits, automobile liability, general liability, directors and officers liability, workers' compensation and property insurance.
(8)   deferred compensation payments are dependent on elected payment dates. while we expect that these payments will be made more than five years from the latest balance sheet date, payments may be made earlier depending on such elections. our deferred compensation plans are funded through investments in life insurance policies. other retirement obligations consist of our expected required contributions to sator's pension plan. we have not included future funding requirements beyond 2016 in the table above, as these funding projections are not practicable to estimate.

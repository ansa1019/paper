item 1a. risk factors the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and/or the trading price of our common stock.  although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below.  our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations.  you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.  the order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.
the health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating and we may not be able to compete successfully.
we compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.  some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully.  most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors.  competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market.  manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors.  industry consolidation among health care product distributors, price competition, the unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition.  there has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability.  additionally, in this competitive market, some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments.  we could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments.  in the future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability.
because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us, we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.
we obtain substantially all of our products from third parties.  generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us.  therefore, suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request.  while there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell, some key suppliers, in the aggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell.  additionally, because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements.  the failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the fda or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall, cessation of sales or other market disruptions.  in the event that any of our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis.  there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all.  an extended interruption in the supply of our products, especially any high sales volume product, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock.
18
our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute.
our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers.  if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business may be materially adversely affected.
our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management.
our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management, particularly stanley m. bergman, chairman and chief executive officer, among others.  the loss of the services of mr. bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business.  we have an employment agreement with mr. bergman.  we do not currently have "key man" life insurance policies on any of our employees.  competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.
we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  as a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.
our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  we expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:
•   timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;

•   timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers;

•   timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers;

•   timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;

•   changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs;

•   supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;

•   changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market;

•   costs of developing new applications and services;

•   our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;

•   uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems;

•   unexpected regulatory actions, or government regulation generally;

•   exclusivity requirements with certain suppliers may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers;

•   loss of sales representatives;

•   costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;

19
•   costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;

•   general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;

•   our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;

•   unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;

•   product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers;

•   exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;

•   increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers;

•   fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;

•   restructuring costs;

•   the adoption or repeal of legislation; and

•   changes in accounting principles.

any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate.  if our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.
expansion of group purchasing organizations ("gpo") or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
the medical products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which can vary by manufacturer and/or product. under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain. the multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as gpos, demand more favorable pricing terms. additionally, the formation of provider networks and gpos may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship. this may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which would in turn negatively impact our financial results. although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers, obtain access to lower prices demanded by gpo contracts or other contracts, and develop relationships with provider networks and new gpos, we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed.
increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business.
shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business.  we ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment.  accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.
20
uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the united states, europe and other parts of the world could adversely affect our customers and suppliers, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. these uncertainties, including, among other things, sovereign debt levels, the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic, currency or budgetary crises or issues, consumer confidence, election results, unemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population), interest rates, availability of capital, fuel and energy costs, tax rates, health care costs and the threat or outbreak of terrorism or public unrest, could adversely impact our customers and suppliers, which could materially adversely affect us.  changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending, and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall.  additionally, recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale.  we generally sell products to customers with payment terms.  if customers' cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us.  likewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms.  any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products and/or services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.
our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.  disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.
the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.
the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.  a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including:
•   the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;

•   changes in our industry and competitors;

•   changes in government or legislation;

•   our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;

•   stock repurchases;

•   any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, issuances of restricted stock/units and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;

•   general market and economic conditions; and

•   any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business.

in addition, the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq.  broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.  in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies.  this type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
21
the health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business.
the health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences.  in recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including: trends toward managed care; consolidation of health care distribution companies; consolidation of health care manufacturers; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers, as well as growing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental officials.  both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services, changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined and, in the case of animal health practitioners, changes in the use of feed additives (including, without limitation, antibiotics and growth promotants) used in the production of animal products due to trade restrictions, animal welfare and/or government regulations; and changes in customer buying habits (including customers purchasing animal health pharmaceuticals outside the veterinarians' offices).  if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.
the implementation of the health care reform law could materially adversely affect our business.
the united states patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act, each enacted in march 2010, generally known as the health care reform law, significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers.  we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services, but other provisions of the health care reform law could have a material adverse effect on our business, and the health care reform law may be invalidated, in whole or in part, or it may be repealed.  additionally, further federal and state proposals for health care reform in the united states are likely, and foreign government authorities may also adopt reforms of their health systems.  we cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.
the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013, and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold.  as part of h.r. 2029 - consolidated appropriations act, 2016 a moratorium was imposed on the medical device excise tax for the period beginning january 1, 2016 and ending on december 31, 2017.  as such, the medical device excise tax does not apply to sales during that period.
the implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the physician payment sunshine act provisions of the health care reform law could adversely affect our business.
a health care reform law provision, generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program, imposes reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  on february 1, 2013, cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act.  under this rule, data collection activities (which began on august 1, 2013) as required under the physician payment sunshine act, cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.  under the physician payment sunshine act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals, and we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements.  the physician payment sunshine act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous.  we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements, our compliance with these new rules imposes additional costs on us.
22
failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business.
our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as hct/p products, and animal feed and supplements.  among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act, the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, as amended, and section 361 of the public health services act.  among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:
•   regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting, record keeping, introduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, hct/p products and medical devices;

•   subject us to inspection by the fda and the dea;

•   regulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;

•   require us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable fda requirements;

•   require registration with the fda and the dea and various state agencies;

•   require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;

•   require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the dea;

•   require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities; and

•   impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, hct/p product or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.

applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal information, installation, maintenance and repair of equipment, and the importation and exportation of products.  our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad.  the fda and dea have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities.
the failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our business.  there can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business.  the costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they may be modified, could be material.  allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.  if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees, and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution.  if we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses.  non-compliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs, and damage our reputation.
23
if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.
certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  some of these laws, referred to as "false claims laws," prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  other laws, referred to as "anti-kickback laws," prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  health care fraud measures may implicate, for example, our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices, and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billing-related functionality.
the fraud and abuse regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity, over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of "relators," who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws.  under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  also, violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to $11,000 per claim.  most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties.  the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal anti-kickback law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal anti-kickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability.
the united states government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  as a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.
we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and other anti-bribery laws, anti-corruption laws, and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.  our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results, including, without limitation, securities, antitrust and marketing laws and regulations.  failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  in addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of non-compliance.  we may determine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters.  for example, one of our subsidiaries recently resolved an investigation by the federal trade commission ("ftc") related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software, which resulted in a consent order and fine.  failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business.
24
while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities.
our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.  these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.  for example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as hipaa.  hipaa requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.  also, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
other health information standards, such as regulations under hipaa, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions, for example transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers.  commencing july 1, 2012, cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard called version 5010.  cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry, the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission, called the icd-10-cm.  the icd-10-cm standard was implemented on october 1, 2015, and claims with dates of service of october 1, 2015 or after must be submitted using icd-10-cm code sets.  certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements, and while we believe that our products have timely adopted the new standards, it is possible that the transition to these new standards, particularly the transition to icd-10-cm, may result in a degree of disruption and confusion, thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting these products.  failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards, could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.
in addition, federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  the initiatives include providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified ehr systems in accordance with applicable requirements.  in addition, medicare-eligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet "meaningful use" requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions, which reductions for applicable health professionals (including physicians and dentists) began on january 1, 2015.  qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and onc.  generally, initial ("stage 1") standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011, and more demanding "stage 2" standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2014.  on october 6, 2015, cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that, among other things, establish the more challenging "stage 3" criteria, making certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards (e.g., reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days), and finalize 2015 edition health technology (hit) certification criteria (which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria, but not required until 2018).  notably, under the new rules, compliance with
25
stage 3 standards will be optional for providers in 2017, and would generally be required for all eligible providers (regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program) for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently. developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products, and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period. in connection with the release of the october 6 rules, hhs has also stated it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards. in addition, under the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 (macra), which establishes the merit-based incentive payment system (mips), over the next few years the ehr program is expected to become part of a more comprehensive federal quality measurement and incentive program, apparently with modified applicable requirements, and cms has indicated that it may even supplant certain stage 3 rules with more streamlined mips approaches. certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs, and therefore we must maintain compliance with, and are affected by, these changing governmental criteria.
our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business.
global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business.  the risks that our global operations are subject to include, among other things:
•   difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;

•   difficulties in establishing channels of distribution;

•   fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;

•   longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;

•   repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the united states;

•   regulatory requirements;

•   anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records;

•   unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products;

•   imposition of import/export duties, quotas, sanctions or penalties;

•   difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing in foreign markets;

•   limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;

•   unexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;

•   changes in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment;

•   civil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups; and

•   public health emergencies.

our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks.
we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future.  such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock.  some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  in addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:
•   may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;

•   requires significant management attention;

26
•   may place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources; and

•   results in additional acquisition and integration expenses.

there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful.  our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following:
•   the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;

•   our ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to u.s. or foreign antitrust regulations;

•   the availability of financing on acceptable terms, in the case of non-stock transactions;

•   the liquidity of our investments and our ability to raise capital could be affected by the financial credit markets; and

•   our ability to retain, recruit, and incentivize the management of the companies we acquire.

our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.
we are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations, services, products and personnel of each company within our management policies, procedures and strategies.  we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions.  to effectively manage our expected future growth, we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, working capital management, and financial and operational controls.  if we fail in any of these areas, our business could be materially adversely affected.
we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury.
our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products.  additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products.  as a result, we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities.  additionally, as our private-label business continues to grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims.  another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain.  in addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials.  the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability.  we have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  in many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others, the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification.  there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection.  a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.
our technology segment depends upon continued software and e-services product development, technical support and successful marketing.
competition among companies supplying practice management software and/or e-services is intense and increasing.  our future sales of practice management software and e-services will depend on, among other factors:
•   the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;

•   our ability to enhance our products and services to satisfy customer requirements; and

27
•   our ability to provide ongoing technical support.

we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software, software enhancements or e-services, or that such software, software enhancements and e-services will be released on time or accepted by the market.  our software and applicable e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released.  we cannot be sure that future problems with post-release software errors or bugs will not occur.  any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation.  we do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections.  we cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or e-services products.
we may experience competition from third-party online commerce sites.
traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions.  the continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis.  the emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.
security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our information systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time.
we rely on information systems (is) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store data to, among other things:
•   maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;

•   receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;

•   manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;

•   process payments to suppliers; and

•   provide products and services that maintain certain of our customers' electronic medical or dental records (including protected health information of their patients).

information security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack that bypasses our is security systems causing an is security breach may lead to a material disruption of our is business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
in addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the is security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies.   in particular, certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  these customers are subject to laws and regulations, such as hipaa, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers' comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses.
28
regarding direct customer claims, although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges, or that we will be able to obtain such provisions in all cases.
in addition, our information systems also utilize certain third party service organizations that manage a portion of our information systems, and our business may be materially adversely affected if these third party service organizations are subject to an is security breach.  additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services.
risks associated with these and other is security breaches may include, among other things:
•   future results could be materially adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property;

•   operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities;

•   procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new is challenges, and enhancing protections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional costs on us;

•   we may incur claims, fines and penalties, and costs for remediation, or substantial defense and settlement expenses; and

•   negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers.

we also deliver internet-based services and, accordingly, depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the internet.  in the event of any difficulties, outages and delays by internet service providers, we may be impeded from providing such services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.
we have various insurance policies, including cyber liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.  successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.
certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  these provisions, among other things:
•   require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and

•   require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to (i) remove a director; and (ii) to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions.

in addition, our 2013 stock incentive plan and 2015 non-employee director stock incentive plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control.  these incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter, and certain other awards made under these incentive plans (such as restricted stock/unit awards) accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control.  further, certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case, within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control.
29
tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.
we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions.  from time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives.  in addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

where you can find important information we may disclose important information through one or more of the following channels: sec filings, public conference calls and webcasts, press releases, the investor relations page of our website (www.henryschein.com) and the social media channels identified on the investor relations page of our website.
executive-level overview we believe we are the world's largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners.  we serve more than 1 million customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories, animal health clinics and physician practices, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.  we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 83 years of experience distributing health care products.
we are headquartered in melville, new york, employ nearly 19,000 people (of which more than 8,500 are based outside the united states) and have operations or affiliates in 33 countries, including the united states, australia, austria, belgium, brazil, canada, chile, china, the czech republic, denmark, france, germany, hong kong sar, iceland, ireland, israel, italy, japan, luxembourg, malaysia, the netherlands, new zealand, norway, poland, portugal, romania, slovakia, south africa, spain, sweden, switzerland, thailand and the united kingdom.
37
we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency.  this infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers' needs.  our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.
we conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services.  these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.
the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental, animal health and medical operating segments.  this segment distributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.  our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions.  our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics.  our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions.
our technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners.  our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics.  our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education services for practitioners.
industry overview in recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.  this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.  it also has accelerated the growth of hmos, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support.  we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management.
our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the health care industry, including consolidation of health care distribution companies, health care reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.
our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty, particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services.
industry consolidation the health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and diverse.  this industry, which encompasses the dental, animal health and medical markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $45 billion in 2015 in the global markets.  the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices.
due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.  the purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant.  supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.
38
the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base.  health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner, affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals, health systems, group practices or physician hospital organizations.  in many cases, purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level; however, orders are delivered to the practitioners' offices.
we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities.  this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.
our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.  this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired businesses.
as industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend, as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure.  we also have invested in expanding our sales/marketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the office-based practitioner setting.
as the health care industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued.  if additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.
aging population and other market influences the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage.  in addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians' offices.
according to the u.s. census bureau's international data base, in 2014 there were more than six million americans aged 85 years or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care and elder-care services.  by the year 2050, that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 18 million.  the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 60% during the same time period.
as a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states.  we believe that demand for our products and services will grow, while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating, economic and industry conditions.  the centers for medicare and medicaid services, or cms,  published "national health expenditure projections 2014-2024" indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately $3.1 trillion in 2014, or 17.7% of the nation's gross domestic product, the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states.  health care spending is projected to reach approximately $5.4 trillion in 2024, approximately 19.6% of the nation's gross domestic product.
39
government certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care, and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and/or medical treatments or services.  also, many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance.  in addition, our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance, including securities, antitrust and other laws and regulations.  failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
health care reform the united states health care reform law adopted through the march 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage.
the health care reform law requirements include a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 (a moratorium was imposed beginning january 1, 2016 and ending on december 31, 2017 and therefore the tax does not apply to sales during that period) and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales.  the health care reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance.  the health care reform law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been interpreted.  as a result, while upholding the law generally, the united states supreme court has effectively made the health care reform law's medicaid expansion voluntary for each state.  there has been an effort by the political party in control of congress to repeal some or all of the law.  the uncertain status of the health care reform law affects our ability to plan.
a health care reform law provision, generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  on february 1, 2013, cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act.  under this rule, data collection activities began on august 1, 2013, and as required under the physician payment sunshine act, cms publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.
under the physician payment sunshine act, we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals, and we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable physician payment sunshine act requirements.  the physician payment sunshine act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the physician payment sunshine act, and some of these state laws are also ambiguous.   we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements, our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us.
40
health care fraud certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  some of these laws, referred to as "false claims laws," prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  other laws, referred to as "anti-kickback laws," prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.
the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of "relators," who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws.  under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  also, violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to $11,000 per claim.  most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal false claims act penalties.  the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal anti-kickback law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal anti-kickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability.
the united states government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  as a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.
we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.
failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  in addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance.
while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
operating, security and licensure standards the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state.
the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and pre-empts state law.  title ii of this measure, known as the drug supply chain security act ("dscsa"), will be phased in over 10 years, and is intended to build a national
41
electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states. the law's track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs began to take effect in january 2015, subject to certain enforcement delays by the united states food and drug administration ("fda"). for example, the fda announced that in light of difficulties experienced by some dispensers in establishing electronic systems to handle required product tracing information, it would delay to march 1, 2016 its enforcement of certain track and trace requirements scheduled to apply to dispensers on july 1, 2015, although this delay does not affect current dscsa requirements that apply to other trading partners, such as manufacturers and wholesale distributors. the dscsa product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the dscsa requirements. also in january 2015, the dscsa required manufacturers and wholesale distributors to have systems in place by which they can identify whether a product in their possession or control is a "suspect" or "illegitimate" product, and handle it accordingly.
the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers ("3pls"), and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities.  the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs.  beginning january 1, 2015, the dscsa required wholesalers and 3pls to submit annual reports to the fda, which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed, the name and address of each facility and contact information.  according to fda guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area.  current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa.
we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable dscsa requirements.
the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 ("fdaaa") and the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 ("fdasia") amended the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act ("fdca") to require the fda to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification system.  the fda issued a final rule on september 24, 2013 implementing the unique device identification system, requiring the labels of most medical devices to bear a unique device identifier ("udi"), and prescribing the content and format of the udi.  the rule also requires the submission of certain information concerning udi-labeled devices to an fda database, the global unique device identification database ("gudid").  additional fda udi guidance has subsequently been issued, and the fda's udi regulations are being phased in over seven years from the rule's promulgation in september 2013, beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., class iii medical devices) and ending with the lowest-risk devices.  for the lowest-risk, class i medical devices, a universal product code may take the place of a udi on the device's label.
the fda's udi regulations require certain entities, referred to as "labelers," to develop and include udis on the labels of medical devices, and to directly mark certain devices with udis.  labelers are entities that cause a device's label to be applied or modified, without any subsequent replacement or modification.  typically, these entities are device manufacturers, specification developers, single-use device reprocessors, convenience kit assemblers, repackagers and relabelers.
violations of the udi regulations, including failure to include a udi on a device's label after the effective date for the device type, result in the misbranding of the device.  the fdca makes it unlawful to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a misbranded device.  it is also unlawful to cause a device to become misbranded.
we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable udi requirements.
42
regulated software; electronic health records the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings, and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices.  certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.
in addition, our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.  these information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.  for example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, as amended, and implementing regulations ("hipaa").  hipaa requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities.
we also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  these customers are subject to laws and regulations, such as hipaa, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers' comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.
federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  the initiatives include providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology ("ehr") in accordance with applicable requirements.  in addition, medicare-eligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet "meaningful use" requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions, which reductions for applicable health professionals (including physicians and dentists) began on january 1, 2015.  qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by cms and by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology ("onc") of the department of health and human services ("hhs").  generally, initial ("stage 1") standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011, and more demanding "stage 2" standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2014.  on october 6, 2015, cms and onc released comprehensive final rules with respect to the ehr program that, among other things, establish the more challenging "stage 3" criteria, make certain adjustments to stage 1 and stage 2 standards (e.g., reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days), and finalize 2015 edition health information technology (hit) certification criteria (which is now added to the existing 2014 edition hit certification criteria, but not required until 2018).  notably, under the new rules, compliance with stage 3 standards will be optional for providers in 2017, and would generally be required for all eligible providers (regardless of prior participation in the ehr incentive program) for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently.  developers and others involved in the manufacture of ehr program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products, and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 ehr program period.  in connection with the release of the october 6 rules, hhs has also stated it will continue to modify applicable ehr program standards.  in addition, under the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 (macra), which establishes the merit-based incentive payment system (mips), over the next few years the ehr program is expected to become part of a more
43
comprehensive federal quality measurement and incentive program, apparently with modified applicable requirements, and cms has indicated that it may even supplant certain stage 3 rules with more streamlined mips approaches. certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs, and therefore, we must maintain compliance with, and are affected by, these changing governmental criteria.
hipaa requires certain health care providers, such as physicians, to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions.  commencing july 1, 2012, cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard, called version 5010.  cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry, the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission, called the icd-10-cm.  the icd-10-cm standard was implemented on october 1, 2015, and claims with dates of service of october 1, 2015 or after must be submitted using icd-10-cm code sets.  certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements, and while we believe that our products have timely adopted the new standards, it is possible that the transition to these new standards, particularly the transition to icd-10-cm, may result in a degree of disruption and confusion, thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting these products.
there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care.
e-commerce electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships.  our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition.  the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.
through our proprietary, technologically based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives.  we believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business.  we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.

plans of restructuring on november 6, 2014, we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies, which was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015.  this initiative is expected to include the elimination of approximately 2% to 3% of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities.  we have subsequently determined that the restructuring activities under this initiative will not be completed until the first half of fiscal 2016.
the total costs associated with the actions to complete this restructuring are expected to be in the range of $41 million to $47 million pre-tax, of which $34.9 million pre-tax were recorded during the year ended december 26, 2015.  these ongoing actions will allow us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure to fund new initiatives to drive future growth under our 2015 - 2017 strategic planning cycle.
on february 5, 2016, we estimated that the total remaining restructuring costs we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring activity to be $6 million to $12 million, consisting of $5 million to $10 million in employee severance pay and benefits and $1 million to $2 million in facility costs, representing primarily lease termination and other facility closure related costs.
the costs associated with this restructuring are included in a separate line item, "restructuring costs" within our consolidated statements of income.

gross profit increased $100.9 million, or 3.5%, for the year ended december 26, 2015 compared to the prior year period.  as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.  additionally, we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment.  these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services, as well as certain financial services. the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development.
within our health care distribution segment, gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next.  changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin.  for example, sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products.  conversely, sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average.  with respect to customer mix, sales to our large-group customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to office-based practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies.
health care distribution gross profit increased $88.5 million, or 3.3%, for the year ended december 26, 2015 compared to the prior year period.  health care distribution gross profit margin increased to 27.0% for the year ended december 26, 2015 from 26.7% for the comparable prior year period.  the overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit is primarily attributable to acquisitions which contributed $98.6 million of additional gross profit in our health care distribution segment for the year ended december 26, 2015 compared to the prior year period.  the offsetting decrease of $10.1 million in our health care distribution segment gross profit was primarily attributable to the effects of foreign exchange.
technology and value-added services gross profit increased $12.5 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended december 26, 2015 compared to the prior year period.  technology and value-added services gross profit margin increased to 67.9% for the year ended december 26, 2015 from 66.2% for the comparable prior year period.  acquisitions accounted for $1.6 million of our gross profit increase within our technology and value-added services segment for the year ended december 26, 2015 compared to the prior year period. the remaining increase of $10.9 million in our technology and value-added services segment gross profit was attributable to improvements in the gross margin rate resulting from changes in product mix.

other expense, net increased $7.4 million to $13.2 million for the year ended december 26, 2015 from the comparable prior year period.  interest income decreased $0.7 million primarily due to lower late fee income.  interest expense increased $2.0 million primarily due to increased borrowings under our private placement facilities and our bank credit lines.  other, net decreased by $4.7 million due primarily to a contractual payment in 2014 from an animal health supplier in europe related to a change to a non-exclusive sales model.
income taxes for the year ended december 26, 2015, our effective tax rate was 29.3% compared to 30.4% for the prior year period.  during the third quarter of 2015, we received a favorable response to a tax petition, which has allowed us to conclude that it is more likely than not that certain unrecognized tax benefits, which had been previously reserved, will be realized.  as a result, our provision for income taxes includes a $6.3 million income tax benefit.
absent the effects of this income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2015, our effective tax rate for the year ended december 26, 2015 would have been 30.2% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 29.3%.  the remaining difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.  for 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 30%.
net income net income increased $18.0 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended december 26, 2015, compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above.

gross profit increased $255.3 million, or 9.6%, for the year ended december 27, 2014 compared to the prior year period.  as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.  additionally, we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment.  these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services, as well as certain financial services. the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development.
within our health care distribution segment, gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next.  changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin.  for example, sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products.  conversely, sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average.  with respect to customer mix, sales to our large-group customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to office-based practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies.
health care distribution gross profit increased $228.9 million, or 9.3%, for the year ended december 27, 2014 compared to the prior year period.  health care distribution gross profit margin increased to 26.7% for the year ended december 27, 2014 from 26.5% for the comparable prior year period.  the slight overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit margin reflects stable margins in each of the segment's operating units.  acquisitions accounted for $161.5 million of our gross profit increase within our health care distribution segment for the year ended december 27, 2014 compared to the prior year period.  the remaining increase of $67.4 million in our health care distribution segment gross profit was attributable to a $95.5 million gross profit increase from our growth in internally generated revenue, partially offset by a $28.1 million gross profit decrease related to a slight decline in the gross margin rate, primarily due to lower margins on our dental equipment and animal health sales.
technology and value-added services gross profit increased $26.4 million, or 12.9%, for the year ended december 27, 2014 compared to the prior year period.  technology and value-added services gross profit margin increased to 66.2% for the year ended december 27, 2014 from 64.0% for the comparable prior year period.  acquisitions accounted for $8.7 million of our gross profit increase within our technology and value-added services segment for the year ended december 27, 2014 compared to the prior year period. the remaining increase of $17.7 million in our technology and value-added services segment gross profit was attributable to a $12.1 million gross profit increase from our growth in internally generated revenue and a $5.6 million gross profit increase related to improvements in the gross margin rate primarily due to changes in the product sales mix and higher margins on our electronic services revenues.

selling, general and administrative expenses increased $217.2 million, or 11.0%, for the year ended december 27, 2014 from the comparable prior year period.  the $207.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses within our health care distribution segment for the year ended december 27, 2014 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to $145.7 million additional costs from acquired companies and $62.0 million of additional operating costs.  the $9.5 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses within our technology and value-added services segment for the year ended december 27, 2014 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to $5.7 million of additional costs from acquired companies and $3.8 million of additional operating costs.  as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 21.2% from 20.7% for the comparable prior year period.

other expense, net decreased $6.5 million to $5.8 million for the year ended december 27, 2014 from the comparable prior year period.  interest income increased $0.8 million.  interest expense decreased $3.5 million primarily due to the $6.2 million accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the early repayment of our henry schein animal health (formerly butler schein animal health) ("hsah") debt during february 2013, partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our bank credit lines and our private placement facilities.  other, net increased by $2.2 million due primarily to a contractual payment from an animal health supplier in europe related to a change to a non-exclusive sales model.
income taxes for the year ended december 27, 2014, our effective tax rate was 30.4% compared to 28.7% for the prior year period.  during the third quarter of 2013, we concluded that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards originating outside the united states, which had been previously reserved, will be realized.  as a result, our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 28, 2013 included a $13.4 million reduction of the valuation allowance which was based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards.
absent the effects of the reduction of this valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2013, our effective tax rate for the year ended december 28, 2013 would have been 30.7% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 28.7%.  the remaining difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rates for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.

loss on sale of equity investment on july 10, 2013, we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the middle east that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors.  the divestiture resulted in a one-time loss of $12.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2013.  pursuant to the terms of this divestiture, we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of $13.4 million, which it was required to use to reduce its debt, pay certain trade payables and provide working capital.  the investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012.  there was no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture.
net income net income increased $34.0 million, or 7.2%, for the year ended december 27, 2014 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above.
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions, purchases of additional noncontrolling interests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs, purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock.  working capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables.  historically, sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy-in opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year, and have caused our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year.
we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt placements.  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services, and access to products and services from our suppliers.
our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.  inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory.  we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements.
we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months.  funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may change.  consequently, we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements.
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets, and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.  we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
net cash provided by operating activities was $586.8 million for the year ended december 26, 2015, compared to $592.5 million for the prior year.  the net change of $5.7 million was primarily attributable to unfavorable working capital changes, partially offset by net income improvements.
net cash used in investing activities was $260.0 million for the year ended december 26, 2015, compared to $516.6 million for the prior year.  the net change of $256.6 million was primarily due to decreased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions and decreased purchases of fixed assets.
net cash used in financing activities was $319.4 million for the year ended december 26, 2015, compared to $154.6 million for the prior year.  the net change of $164.8 million was primarily due to decreased net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.

bank credit lines on september 12, 2012, we entered into a new $500 million revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with a $200 million expansion feature, which was originally set to expire on september 12, 2017.  on september 22, 2014, we extended the expiration date of the credit agreement to september 22, 2019.  the interest rate is based on the usd libor plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.  the credit agreement provides, among other things, that we are required to maintain maximum leverage ratios, and contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants.  the credit agreement also contains customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, indebtedness, significant corporate changes (including mergers), dispositions and certain restrictive agreements.   as of december 26, 2015 and december 27, 2014, the borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility were $40.0 million and $0, respectively.  as of december 26, 2015 and december 27, 2014, there were $11.4 million and $10.1 million of letters of credit, respectively, provided to third parties under the credit facility.

private placement facilities on august 10, 2010, we entered into $400 million private placement facilities with two insurance companies.  on april 30, 2012, we increased our available credit facilities by $375 million by entering into a new agreement with one insurance company and amending our existing agreements with two insurance companies.  on september 22, 2014, we increased our available private placement facilities by $200 million to a total facility amount of $975 million, and extended the expiration date to september 22, 2017.  these facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance, from time to time through september 22, 2017.  the facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance.  the term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years (with an average life no longer than 12 years). the proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, to refinance existing indebtedness and/or to fund potential acquisitions.  the agreements provide, among other things, that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios, and contain restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership.  these facilities contain make-whole provisions in the event that we pay off the facilities prior to the applicable due dates.
the components of our private placement facility borrowings as of december 26, 2015 are presented in the following table (in thousands):

u.s. trade accounts receivable securitization on april 17, 2013, we entered into a facility agreement of up to $300 million with a bank, as agent, based on the securitization of our u.s. trade accounts receivable.  this facility allowed us to replace public debt (approximately $220 million), which had a higher interest rate at hsah during february 2013 and provided funding for working capital and general corporate purposes.  the financing was structured as an asset-backed securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years.  on april 17, 2015, we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to april 15, 2018.  the borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were $90.0 million and $150.0 million as of december 26, 2015 and december 27, 2014, respectively.  at december 26, 2015, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 40 basis points plus 75 basis points, for a combined rate of 1.15%.  at december 27, 2014, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 20 basis points plus 75 basis points, for a combined rate of 0.95%.
54
we are required to pay a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is greater than or equal to 50% of the facility limit or a commitment fee of 35 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is less than 50% of the facility limit.
borrowings under this facility are presented as a component of long-term debt within our consolidated balance sheet.
henry schein animal health during february 2013, we repaid the then outstanding debt related to the hsah (formerly butler schein animal health) transaction using our existing credit agreement.  as part of this transaction, we recorded a one-time interest expense charge of $6.2 million related to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs.

divestiture of an equity affiliate on july 10, 2013, we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the middle east that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors.  the divestiture resulted in a one-time loss of $12.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2013.  pursuant to the terms of this divestiture, we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of $13.4 million, which it was required to use to reduce its debt, pay certain trade payables and provide working capital.  the investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012.  there was no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture.
stock repurchases from june 21, 2004 through december 26, 2015, we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion, or 21,441,511 shares, under our common stock repurchase programs, with $400 million available as of december 26, 2015 for future common stock share repurchases.

redeemable noncontrolling interests some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.  accounting standards codification topic 480-10 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements.  the components of the change in the redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 26, 2015, december 27, 2014 and december 28, 2013 are presented in the following table:

changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital.  future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.
additionally, some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met.  any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income.
unrecognized tax benefits as more fully disclosed in note 12 of "notes to consolidated financial statements," we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, of $93.1 million as of december 26, 2015.
56
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  we base our estimates on historical data, when available, experience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  however, by their nature, estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties.  reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions, judgments and estimates, including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, which have been discussed with our audit committee, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of dental, animal health and medical consumable products, as well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized.
revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party common carriers. we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable.
revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers. such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians. some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is typically completed at the time of delivery.
revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design. revenue derived from post-contract customer support for software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the services are provided.
revenue derived from multiple element arrangements, and the related deferral of such revenue (which is insignificant to our financial statements), is recognized as follows. when we sell software products together with related services (i.e., training and technical support) we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method, based upon vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of the fair value of the undelivered elements, or defer it until such time as vendor-specific evidence of fair value is obtained. multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service.  we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy: first vsoe, then third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price if vsoe is not available, and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. vsoe exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable. estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business, technical skill required, customer location and other market conditions. each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered.
revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided.
57
accounts receivable and reserves the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected.  the reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns.  in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends.  from time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability.  although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
inventories and reserves inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market. cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment.  in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.
from time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory.  although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually.  such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.  we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: health care distribution (global dental, animal health and medical) and technology and value-added services.  goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis.
for the year ended december 26, 2015, we tested goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis consisting of a two-step approach.  the first step of our quantitative analysis consists of a comparison of the carrying value of our reporting units, including goodwill, to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology.  if step one results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting unit, we would then proceed to step two which would require us to calculate the amount of impairment loss, if any, that we would record for such reporting unit.  the calculation of the impairment loss in step two would be equivalent to the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill.
our use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future revenue based upon budget projections and growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates.  we also develop estimates for future levels of gross and operating profits and projected capital expenditures.  our methodology also includes the use of estimated discount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as other factors. the estimates that we use in our discounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by management that are based upon future growth projections.
58
for the years ended december 27, 2014 and december 28, 2013, we tested goodwill impairment under the provisions of accounting standards update 2011-08, "intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): testing goodwill for impairment," which allowed us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values.  the factors that we considered in developing our qualitative assessment included:
•   macroeconomic conditions consisting of the overall sales growth of our business and the overall sales growth of each of our operating segments. we also consider our growth in market share in the markets in which we compete;

•   credit markets and our ability to access debt facilities at favorable terms;

•   key personnel and management expertise, as well as our growth strategies for the next several years; and

•   our expectations of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit.

our impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets.  this comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment.  for indefinite-lived intangible assets, a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows, is utilized.  we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually (at the beginning of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:
•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

•   significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business (e.g., decision to divest a business); or

•   significant negative industry or economic trends.

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income.
for the years ended december 26, 2015, december 27, 2014 and december 28, 2013, the results of our goodwill and intangible impairment analysis did not result in any impairments.
supplier rebates supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned.  the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume.  although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets.
definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property.  for long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows.  we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value.  when an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.  although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results.
59
stock-based compensation we measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award.  stock-based awards are provided to certain employees and non-employee directors under the terms of our 2013 stock incentive plan, as amended, and our 2015 non-employee director stock incentive plan (together, the "plans").  the plans are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors.  prior to march 2009, awards under the plans principally included a combination of at-the-money stock options and restricted stock/units.  since march 2009, equity-based awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock/units, with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain pre-existing contractual obligations.
grants of restricted stock/units are stock-based awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions.  in the case of restricted stock, common stock is delivered on the date of grant, subject to vesting conditions.  in the case of restricted stock units, common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions.  we issue restricted stock/units that vest solely based on the recipient's continued service over time (primarily four-year cliff vesting, except for grants made under the 2015 non-employee director stock incentive plan, which are primarily 12-month cliff vesting) and restricted stock/units that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient's continued service over time (primarily three-year cliff vesting).
with respect to time-based restricted stock/units, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price.  with respect to performance-based restricted stock/units, the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a three-year period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors.  although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock/units based on our closing stock price at time of grant.
the plans provide for adjustments to the performance-based restricted stock/units targets for significant events such as acquisitions, divestitures, new business ventures, share repurchases and certain foreign exchange fluctuations.  over the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets.  the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the plans.
although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to stock-based compensation are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
recently issued accounting standards in november 2015, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2015-17 (topic 740), balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. asu 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. the standard will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. the asu may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2015-17 on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-03, "simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs" ("asu 2015-03").  asu 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the related liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts.  further, asu 2015-03 requires the amortization of debt issuance costs to be reported as interest expense.  similarly, debt issuance costs and any discount or premium are considered in the aggregate when determining the effective interest rate on the debt.  asu 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  asu 2015-03 must be applied retrospectively.  entities may choose to adopt the new requirements as of an earlier date for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  we do not expect asu 2015-03 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
60
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers" ("asu 2014-09"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in united states ("u.s. gaap"). the core principle of asu 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing u.s. gaap.
in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, "revenue from contracts with customers" ("asu 2015-14") which deferred the effective date by one year to december 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date.  early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
when effective, asu 2014-09 will use either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures).  we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-16, "simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments" ("asu 2015-16").  asu 2015-16 removes the previous requirement for an acquiring company to restate prior period financial results due to measurement-period adjustments.  asu 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement-period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  asu 2015-16 also requires presentation of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item, either on the face of the income statement or within the notes to financial statements, which would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  asu 2015-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. the guidance is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance. we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 2015-16 on our consolidated financial statements.

item 1a.   risk factors the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results. you should consider them carefully when evaluating an investment in ptc's securities or any forward-looking statements made by us, including those contained in this annual report, because these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or
5
the performance projected in forward-looking statements. the risks described below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
i. operational considerations our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter, making future operating results difficult to predict; failure to meet market expectations could cause the price of our securities to decline.
our quarterly operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including:
•   a high percentage of our revenue historically has been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and any failure to receive, complete or process orders at the end of any quarter could cause us to fall short of our revenue targets;
•   a significant percentage of our revenue comes from transactions with large customers, which tend to have long lead times that are less predictable;
•   one or more industries that we serve may have weak or negative growth;
•   our operating expenses are largely fixed in the short term and are based on expected revenues and any failure to achieve our revenue targets could cause us to miss our earnings targets as well;
•   our mix of license, subscription and service revenues can vary from quarter to quarter, creating variability in our operating margins;
•   because a significant portion of our revenue comes from outside the u.s. and a significant portion of our expense structure is located internationally, shifts in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our reported results; and
•   we may incur significant expenses in a quarter in connection with corporate development initiatives, restructuring efforts or the investigation, defense or settlement of legal actions that would increase our operating expenses and reduce our earnings for the quarter in which those expenses are incurred.
accordingly, our quarterly results are difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter and we may be unable to confirm or adjust expectations with respect to our operating results for a particular quarter until that quarter has closed. any failure to meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our securities.
we now offer our solutions as subscriptions, which will adversely affect our revenue and earnings in the transition period and make predicting our revenue and earnings more difficult.
we began offering most of our solutions under a subscription option in 2015, in addition to our perpetual license option. under a subscription, customers pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software and receive support, or to use our cloud services and have us manage the application for a specified period. we believe that a significant number of our customers will elect to purchase our solutions as subscriptions rather than under a perpetual license (if available). until we have fully transitioned to a stable mix of subscription and perpetual license purchases, we expect that our license revenue will decrease due to the difference in revenue recognition for a subscription license (revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license) and a perpetual license (revenue is generally recognized upon purchase) and that our support revenue (which comprises a significant portion of our revenue) may also decrease due to support services being included in the subscription offering.
our revenue and earnings targets are based on assumptions about the mix of revenue that will be attributable to subscription and perpetual license revenue. if a greater percentage of our customers elect to purchase our solutions as subscriptions in a period than we assumed, our revenue and earnings will likely fall below our expectations for that period, which could cause our stock price to decline.
our long range financial targets are predicated on revenue growth and operating margin improvements that we may fail to achieve, which could reduce our expected earnings and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors and cause the price of our securities to decline.
we are projecting long-term revenue and earnings growth. however, as we transition to a subscription model, our plan through 2021 assumes that our license revenue and earnings will decrease in 2016, 2017 and 2018 due to lower up-front revenue recognized for a subscription license compared to a perpetual license, and assumes increases in revenue from a recurring subscription revenue stream beginning in 2019. our projections are based on the expected growth potential in the iot and slm markets, with more modest growth expectations for cad and eplm. we may not achieve the expected bookings and
6
revenue growth if the markets we serve do not grow at expected rates, if we are not able to deliver solutions desired by customers and potential customers, and/or if acquired businesses do not generate the revenue growth that we expect.
our long-term operating margin improvement is predicated on operating leverage as long range revenue increases, improved operating efficiencies, particularly within our sales organization and service margin improvements. services margins are significantly lower than license and support margins. future projected improvements in our operating margin as a percent of revenue are based in part on our ability to improve services margins by reducing the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program, and improving the profitability of services that we perform. if our services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue and/or if we are unable to improve our services margins, our overall operating margin may not increase to the levels we expect or may decrease. additionally, if we do not achieve lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue through productivity initiatives, we may not achieve our operating margin targets. if operating margins do not improve, our earnings could be adversely affected and the price of our securities could decline.
our significant investment in our technology platform business may not generate the revenues we expect.
we have made a significant investment in recent years in our technology platform business, including four acquisitions totaling approximately $450 million. our technology platform business provides technology solutions that enable customers to transform their businesses and leverage the opportunities created by the internet of things (iot).
the technology platform market is a new market for us that requires us to adopt a new sales approach.  the go-to-market approach for the technology platform business relies on an extensive and differentiated partner ecosystem to enable us to access markets and customers beyond our traditional markets, customers and buyers.  we also expect to focus on marketing directly to software application developers to become the technology platform of choice for the iot.  we may be unable to expand our partner ecosystem as we expect and developers may not adopt our technology platform solutions as we expect, which would adversely affect our ability to realize revenue from our investments in this business.
further, the internet of things is a relatively new market and there are a significant number of competitors in the market.  if the market does not expand as rapidly as we or others expect or if customers adopt competitive solutions rather than our solutions, our technology platform business may not generate the revenues we expect.
businesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business.
we have acquired, and intend to continue to acquire, new businesses and technologies. if we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses and technologies we acquire, or if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect, our operating results will be adversely affected.
moreover, business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can adversely affect our operations and operating results, including:
•   difficulties managing an acquired company's technologies or lines of business or entering new markets where we have limited or no prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;
•   unanticipated operating difficulties in connection with the acquired entities, including potential declines in revenue of the acquired entity;
•   failure to achieve the expected return on our investments which could adversely affect our business or operating results and impair the assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill;
•   diversion of management and employee attention;
•   loss of key personnel;
•   assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities or other unidentified issues with the acquired business;
•   potential incompatibility of business cultures;
•   significant increases in our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition; and
•   if we were to issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease.
our restructuring actions and reorganization may be disruptive and could harm our operations.
7
over the past few years, we have taken a number of restructuring actions and reorganizations designed to realign our global workforce to our business needs, reduce our expenses and enable us to increase investment in our technology platform business. these actions may not have the expected long-term effect on our expenses or may not be sufficient to fully offset additional investments we may make in our business. disruptions in operations have occurred and will likely continue to occur as a result of these actions. disruptions may include attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. further, we could experience delays, business disruptions, decreased productivity, unanticipated employee turnover and increased litigation related costs in connection with the restructuring and other efficiency initiatives.
we recently committed to a plan to reduce costs and realign investments with what we believe are our high growth opportunities by reducing our workforce and consolidating facilities. this restructuring may result in higher charges than anticipated and / or our actual projected expense reductions may fall below our expectations.
we depend on sales within the discrete manufacturing sector and our business could be adversely affected if manufacturing activity does not grow or if it contracts.
a large amount of our revenue is related to sales to customers in the discrete manufacturing sector. if this economic sector does not grow, or if it contracts, our customers in this sector may, as they have in the past, reduce or defer purchases of our products and services, which adversely affects our business. in 2015, the manufacturing sector was weak, particularly in the americas and china, which we believe adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those regions in 2015. we expect global manufacturing economic conditions could continue to adversely impact our results in 2016, particularly in the u.s. and china.
we face significant competition, which may reduce our profits and limit or reduce our market share.
the market for product development solutions and iot solutions is rapidly changing and characterized by vigorous competition, both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies. this competition could result in price reductions for our products and services, reduced margins, loss of customers and loss of market share. our primary competition comes from:
•   larger companies that offer competitive solutions;
•   larger, more well-known enterprise software providers with greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, and other resources; and
•   other vendors of various competitive point solutions or iot platforms.
in addition, barriers to entry into certain segments of the software industry have declined and the ability of customers to adopt software solutions has increased with the ability to offer software in the cloud and the increasing prevalence of subscription license models and customer acceptance of both those models. because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future.
increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would likely harm our business.
a breach of security in our products or computer systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could compromise the integrity of our products, harm our reputation, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results.
we have implemented and continue to implement measures intended to maintain the security and integrity of our products, source code and computer systems. the potential consequences of a security breach or system disruption (particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists) have increased in scope as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. in addition, we offer cloud services to our customers and some of our products are hosted by third-party service providers, which expose us to additional risks as those repositories of our customers' proprietary data may be targeted by such hackers. a significant breach of the security and/or integrity of our products or systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could prevent our products from functioning properly, could enable access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information, including that of our customers, without authorization, or could disrupt our business operations or those of our customers. this could require us to incur significant costs of remediation, harm our reputation, cause customers to stop buying our products,
8
and cause us to face lawsuits and potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our sales and operations are globally dispersed, which exposes us to additional compliance risks.
we sell and deliver software and services, and maintain support operations, in a large number of countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes. managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws of those countries and those of the u.s. governing our activities in non-u.s. countries.
those laws include, but are not limited to, anti-corruption laws and regulations (including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and the u.k. bribery act 2010) and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations (including laws administered by the u.s. department of the treasury's office of foreign assets control, the u.s. state department, the u.s. department of commerce, the united nations security council and other relevant sanctions authorities). the fcpa and uk bribery act prohibit us and business partners or agents acting on our behalf from offering or providing anything of value to persons considered to be foreign officials under those laws for the purposes of obtaining favorable treatment. the uk bribery act also prohibits commercial bribery and accepting bribes. our compliance risks with these laws are heightened due to the global nature of our business, the fact that we operate in, and are expanding into, countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices than others, and the fact that we deal with governments and state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa and the uk bribery act.
accordingly, while we strive to maintain a comprehensive compliance program, we cannot guarantee that an employee, agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or u.s. or other applicable laws. investigations of alleged violations of those laws can be expensive and disruptive. violations of such laws can lead to civil and/or criminal prosecutions, substantial fines and other sanctions, including the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss. for example, as discussed in risk factors ii. other considerations, we are currently in discussions with the u.s. securities and exchange commission and u.s. department of justice to attempt to resolve an investigation concerning certain payments and expenses by certain business partners and employees in china that raise questions of compliance with laws, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and/or compliance with our business policies.
our international businesses present economic and operating risks.
we expect that our international operations will continue to expand and to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. because we transact business in various foreign currencies, the volatility of foreign exchange rates has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our revenue, expenses and operating results.
other risks inherent in our international operations include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations;
•   possible future limitations upon foreign-owned businesses;
•   increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
•   inadequate local infrastructure; and
•   greater difficulty in protecting our intellectual property.
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights.
our software products are proprietary. we protect our intellectual property rights in these items by relying on copyrights, trademarks, patents and common law safeguards, including trade secret protection, as well as restrictions on disclosures and transferability contained in our agreements with other parties. despite these measures, the laws of all relevant jurisdictions may not afford adequate protection to our products and other intellectual property. in addition, we frequently encounter attempts by individuals and companies to pirate our software. if our measures to protect our intellectual property rights fail, others may be able to use those rights, which could reduce our competitiveness and revenues.
in addition, any legal action to protect our intellectual property rights that we may bring or be engaged in could be costly, may distract management from day-to-day operations and may lead to additional claims against us, and we may not succeed, all of which would materially adversely affect our operating results.
9
intellectual property infringement claims could be asserted against us, which could be expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our use of the claimed intellectual property.
the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights, as well as improper disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. if a lawsuit of this type is filed, it could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claims. if we did not prevail, we could be prevented from using the claimed intellectual property or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which might not be available on terms acceptable to us. in addition to possible claims with respect to our proprietary products, some of our products contain technology developed by and licensed from third parties and we may likewise be susceptible to infringement claims with respect to these third-party technologies.
some of our products contain "open source" software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business and subject us to possible litigation.
some of our products incorporate so-called "open source" software and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future. such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. we monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend. although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use, our processes used to monitor how open source software is used could be improperly followed or subject to error.
if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations. if our defenses were not successful, we could be subject to significant damages. we could also be enjoined from the distribution of our products that contained the open source software or be required to modify our products in order to comply with the conditions of the open source license(s) in question, thereby disrupting the distribution and sale of some of our products. in addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, under some open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, which would adversely affect our ability to derive revenue from the affected products.
our financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software.
sophisticated software can sometimes contain errors, defects or other performance problems. if errors or defects are discovered in our products, we may need to expend significant financial, technical and management resources, or divert some of our development resources, in order to resolve or work around those defects, and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers.
errors, defects or other performance problems in our products could also cause us to lose revenue, lose customers and lose market share, and could subject to liability. such defects or problems could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities.
we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.
as a multinational organization, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities. in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. our tax returns are subject to review by various taxing authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:
•   changes in tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate;
•   assessments, and any related tax interest or penalties, by taxing authorities;
•   changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;
•   changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes;
10
•   unanticipated changes in tax rates; and
•   changes to a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets, if any.
because we have substantial cash requirements in the united states and a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states, if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states, we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our securities.
we have significant operations outside the united states. as of september 30, 2015, approximately 72% of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states, with the remainder of the balance held by the u.s. parent or its subsidiaries in the united states. we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash and cash equivalents, future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility, are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and known capital requirements. however, if these sources of cash are insufficient to meet our future financial obligations in the united states, we will be required to seek other available funding sources or means to repatriate cash to the united states, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and the market price of our securities.
ii. other considerations we have been investigating certain matters in china, the resolution of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results.
we have been in discussions with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) and the department of justice (doj) to resolve an investigation concerning expenditures by our business partners in china and by our china business, including for travel and entertainment, that apparently benefited employees of customers regarded as state owned enterprises in china. this matter involves issues regarding compliance with laws, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. we have recorded liabilities of $28.2 million as a result of our agreements in principle with those agencies to settle the matter. there can be no assurance that we will enter into final settlements on the agreed terms with these agencies or, if not, that the cost of any final settlements, if reached, would not exceed the existing accrual. further, any settlement or other resolution of this matter could have collateral effects on our business in china, the united states and elsewhere.
we are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our credit facility and to make scheduled debt payments as they become due; any failure to comply with those covenants or to make scheduled payments could cause amounts borrowed under the facility to become immediately due and payable and/or prevent us from borrowing under the facility.
our credit facility consists of a $1 billion revolving loan commitment that matures on september 15, 2019, at which time all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full. as of november 4, 2015, we had $718 million outstanding under the credit facility. we may wish to borrow additional amounts under the facility in the future to support our operations, including for strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.
we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants and to make payments under the facility, which limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it. our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any payment obligations under the facility could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. we might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations. in addition, if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants at the time we wish to borrow funds, we will be unable to borrow funds.
we may be unable to meet our goal of returning 40% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases, which could decrease your expected return on investment in ptc stock.
in august 2014, we announced a new capital allocation strategy, a component of which is a long-term goal of returning approximately 40% of free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders through share repurchases. meeting this goal requires ptc to generate consistent free cash flow in the years ahead in an amount sufficient to enable us to continue investing in organic and inorganic growth as well as to return a significant portion of the cash generated to stockholders in the form of share repurchases. we may not meet this goal if we do not generate the free cash flow we expect or if we use our available cash to satisfy other priorities. in addition, our cash flow fluctuates over the course of the year and over multiple years, so, although our goal is to return 40% of free cash flow to shareholders, that is an average over a longer
11
term and the number of shares repurchased and amount of free cash flow returned in any given period will vary and may be more or less than 40% in any such period. finally, the number of shares repurchased for a given amount of cash will vary based on ptc's stock price, so the number of shares repurchased will not be a consistent or predictable number or percentage of outstanding stock.
our stock price has been volatile, which may make it harder to resell your shares at a time and at a price that is favorable to you.
market prices for securities of software companies are generally volatile and are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. the trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. negative changes in the public's perception of the prospects of software companies, or of ptc or the markets we serve, could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results.
also, a large percentage of our common stock is held by institutional investors. purchases and sales of our common stock by these institutional investors could have a significant impact on the market price of the stock. for more information about those investors, please see our proxy statement with respect to our most recent annual meeting of stockholders and schedules 13d and 13g filed with the sec with respect to our common stock.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements statements in this annual report about anticipated financial results and growth, as well as about the development of our products and markets, are forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans and assumptions. important information about the bases for these plans and assumptions and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements is contained below and in item 1a. "risk factors" of this annual report.
unless otherwise indicated, all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on september 30.
executive overview results for 2015
revenue was down year over year due to changes within our business including a higher mix of subscription revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 as we transition from selling perpetual licenses to a subscription-based licensing model, as well as external factors, including a challenging macroeconomic environment and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our reported revenue due to an increase in the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to international currencies, most notably the euro and the yen.

•   software revenue declined due to unfavorable currency movements and fewer large license transactions in the year than in the prior year. perpetual license revenue declined $80 million in 2015 compared to 2014 ($56 million on a constant currency basis). we believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions and execution issues impacted our ability to close large license transactions in our core business. additionally, 2015 was a difficult comparison in relation to 2014, in which cad and eplm had double digit software revenue growth due in part to customer contract cycles.
13
•   year-over-year revenue declines were partially offset by revenue from businesses acquired in 2014. on an organic basis (excluding revenue from acquired businesses), total license and subscription (l&amp;s) revenue was down 18% year over year.
•   professional services revenue declined primarily due to a shift of services to our partners in accordance with our margin improvement strategy.
•   we delivered strong growth in our internet of things business, closing a number of significant deals with large, industrial companies that are adopting our platform for their iot initiatives. iot license revenue represented more than 10% of our total l&amp;s revenue in 2015, compared to 1% in 2014.
•   approximately 58% of our revenue in 2015 came from recurring revenue streams (subscription solutions and support), compared to approximately 52% in 2014.
from a geographic perspective, we believe macroeconomic challenges in the americas and europe impacted our ability to close large cad and eplm deals, which, given the maturity of these markets, tend to be more cyclical. total software revenue was flat in the americas as growth in our iot and slm businesses offset our weaker results in cad and eplm. in europe, we saw 4% software revenue growth on a constant currency basis, driven by iot, slm, and eplm with a decline in cad. pacific rim software revenue declined modestly due to weak results in eplm and slm, which we believe was primarily due to the overall economic slowdown in china. japan software revenue increased 9% in 2015 on a constant currency basis from 2014 due to l&s revenue growth in iot, slm and eplm, offset by a decline in cad.

gaap and non-gaap operating income reflect lower revenue, offset by reductions in operating expenses driven by cost savings from restructuring actions and by lower incentive compensation accruals associated with performance based incentive compensation plans for which the associated performance metrics were not achieved. additionally, our gaap operating margin includes a $66 million pension settlement loss due to the termination of our u.s. pension plan, a $28 million accrual associated with the pending china matter and restructuring charges of $43 million due to our april 2015 restructuring plan. currency movements reduced gaap eps by approximately $0.26. both gaap and non-gaap eps benefited from a lower tax rate.
our gaap results reflect a tax benefit of $19 million related to the reversal of a portion of the u.s. valuation allowance related to reducing deferred tax assets in connection with settling the u.s. pension plan and a tax benefit of $18 million in 2014 related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets in the u.s. and a foreign jurisdiction as a result of accounting for acquisitions.
we generated $180 million of cash from operations in 2015, down 41% from $305 million in 2014, and we borrowed $56 million under our credit facility to fund acquisitions and stock repurchases. the decrease in cash from operations in 2015 compared to 2014 was due in part to pension funding which was higher by $34 million and restructuring payments which were higher by $33 million. we used $99 million of cash to acquire coldlight and $65 million to repurchase stock. at september 30, 2015, the balance outstanding under our credit facility was $668 million and we had $155 million available to borrow under the revolving loan portion of our credit facility. we ended 2015 with $273 million of cash, down from $294 million at the end 2014.
acquisitions in 2015, we acquired coldlight solutions, llc for $99 million. coldlight offers solutions for data machine learning and predictive analytics, which expanded our technology portfolio in the iot market. coldlight was not material to our results for 2015.
2015 restructuring of our workforce
14
in april 2015, we committed to a plan to restructure our global workforce and consolidate select facilities to increase investment in our iot business and to reduce our cost structure through organizational efficiencies in the face of significant foreign currency depreciation relative to the u.s. dollar and a more cautious outlook on global macroeconomic conditions. the restructuring actions resulted in charges of $43 million during 2015, including $1 million of facility related charges and $42 million of employee related termination costs, primarily related to termination benefits associated with 411 employees. this reorganization resulted in net annualized expense reductions of approximately $30 million. we recently announced a 2016 restructuring plan as described below in future expectations, strategies and risks.
pension termination we maintained a u.s. defined benefit pension plan that covered certain persons who were employees of computervision corporation (acquired by us in 1998). benefits under the plan were frozen in 1990. in the second quarter of 2014, we began the process of terminating the plan, which included settling plan liabilities by offering lump sum distributions to certain plan participants and purchasing annuity contracts to cover vested benefits. we completed the termination in the fourth quarter of 2015. in connection with the termination, we contributed $25.5 million to the plan and recorded a settlement loss of $66 million.
future expectations, strategies and risks the slowdown in the global manufacturing industry, uncertainty about the economic environment, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, and our transition to a subscription model were headwinds for revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2015. while we saw indications of improvements in global manufacturing economic conditions early in 2015, recent economic indicators raise continued concerns about the economic climate and current indicators suggest the global manufacturing economy is weaker than we experienced entering 2015, with foreign currency depreciation and other acute macro factors potentially weighing on our multinational customers, particularly in the americas, china and japan.
looking forward, as we move into 2016, we have three overriding goals: 1) to focus on driving sustainable growth, 2) to expand our subscription-based licensing, and 3) to continue to control costs and improve margins.
sustainable growth our goals for overall growth are predicated on continuing to expand our iot technology footprint and making structural changes to our business to improve operational performance and increase growth potential for both our new iot solutions as well as our core solutions. we continue to invest in iot solutions, most recently with our acquisitions of coldlight and vuforia. as described in 2015 business developments, corporate organizational changes above, effective in 2016, we have reorganized the company into two main business units: the solutions group, comprised of our core cad, eplm and slm business, and the technology platform group, comprised of our iot, analytics and augmented reality business. this new structure will allow for appropriate focus on both the core solutions and the technology platform business.
subscription a majority of our software license sales to date have been perpetual licenses, where customers own the software license and revenue is recognized at the time of sale. due to evolving customer preferences, our plan to increase our recurring revenue base, as well as acquisitions we have made in the iot and cloud services space, we began offering our products under a subscription license model in 2015. a small but growing percentage of our business now consists of ratably recognized subscriptions. under a subscription, customers do not own the software license but pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software, including access to technical support. beginning october 1, 2015 we launched the second phase of our subscription program with the goal of accelerating our transition to a predominantly subscription-based licensing model. to drive that acceleration, we launched new pricing and packaging for subscriptions and new sales incentive compensation plans to drive our business toward subscription. we are targeting that by 2018, a significant majority of our l&s bookings could be subscription. in 2016, we expect that subscription bookings will increase over 2015, but will still constitute significantly less than a majority of bookings. if a greater percentage of our customers elect our subscription offering in 2016 than our base case assumption, it will have an adverse impact on revenue, operating margin, cash flow and eps growth relative to our expectations. in addition, subscription orders tend to be smaller in size than perpetual deals.
cost controls and margin expansion we continue to proactively manage our cost structure and invest in what we believe are high return opportunities in our business. our goal is to drive continued margin expansion over the long term. to that end, on october 23, 2015, we committed to a plan to restructure our workforce and consolidate select facilities in order to reduce our cost structure and to realign our investments with our identified growth opportunities.  the restructuring is expected to result in a charge of approximately
15
$40 million to $50 million, which is primarily attributable to termination benefits, substantially all of which will be recorded in our first fiscal quarter ending january 2, 2016.  the restructuring will result in cash expenditures of approximately $40 million to $50 million, which we expect will primarily be paid over the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. we expect that the effect of the expense reductions, offset by certain planned cost increases and investments in our business, will result in a decrease in costs and expenses of approximately $17 million in 2016, as compared to 2015, which effect is contemplated in our financial guidance for fiscal 2016.
2016 guidance for 2016, we expect year-over-year revenue to decrease 3% to 5% due to our subscription transition and expected decrease in professional services revenue. while subscription revenue is expected to grow by approximately 35% in 2016, the subscription transition is expected to result in a 2% decrease in support revenue and 8% to 15% decrease in perpetual revenue.  professional services revenue is expected to decrease 12% due to further transition of certain customers to our partners and ongoing development of solutions that require less professional services to deploy. our results will differ materially from our guidance if economic conditions do not improve or deteriorate further, if foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar differ significantly from our current assumed rates, if customers do not purchase subscriptions at the rate we expect, if our businesses do not grow as we have assumed, or if our cost reductions do not achieve the expected results.
in november 2015, we acquired the vuforia business from qualcomm connected experiences, inc. for $65 million in cash. vuforia is an augmented reality technology platform that expands our technology platform portfolio.
our results have been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by our ability to close large transactions. the amount of bookings and revenue, particularly license and subscriptions, attributable to large transactions, and the number of such transactions, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions. such transactions may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process, and for existing customers, are influenced by contract expiration cycles. this may cause volatility in our results. in 2016, we expect large license transactions will continue to be unfavorably impacted by a challenging global manufacturing economy, particularly affecting our cad and eplm businesses. in addition, we expect that deal sizes will decrease as we expect that customers will purchase more of our solutions as subscriptions, which may involve smaller purchases than perpetual license purchases.
impact of an investigation in china as previously announced, we have been in discussions with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) and the department of justice (doj) to resolve an investigation concerning expenditures by our business partners in china and by our china business, including for travel and entertainment, that apparently benefited employees of customers regarded as state owned enterprises in china. this matter involves issues regarding compliance with laws, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. we have recorded liabilities of $28.2 million as a result of our agreements in principle with those agencies to settle the matter. there can be no assurance that we will enter into final settlements on the agreed terms with these agencies or if not, that the cost of any final settlements, if reached, would not exceed the existing accrual. further, any settlement or other resolution of this matter could have collateral effects on our business in china, the united states and elsewhere.
revenue, operating margin, earnings per share and cash flow the following table shows the financial measures that we consider the most significant indicators of the performance of our business. in addition to providing operating income, operating margin, and diluted earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), it shows non-gaap operating income, operating margin, and diluted earnings per share for the reported periods. these non-gaap measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue, acquired deferred costs, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets expense, acquisition-related and pension plan termination costs, restructuring charges, certain identified gains or charges included in non-operating other income (expense) and the related tax effects of the preceding items, as well as the tax items identified. these non-gaap measures provide investors another view of our operating results that is aligned with management budgets and with performance criteria in our incentive compensation plans. management uses, and investors should use, non-gaap measures in conjunction with our gaap results. we discuss the non-gaap measures in detail under non-gaap measures below.

(1)   costs and expenses in 2015 included $73.2 million of pension plan termination-related costs, $43.4 million of restructuring charges, a $28.2 million legal accrual, and $8.9 million of acquisition-related costs. costs and expenses in 2014 included $28.4 million of restructuring charges and $13.1 million of acquisition-related and pension plan termination costs. costs and expenses in 2013 included $52.2 million of restructuring charges and $9.9 million of acquisition-related costs. these restructuring, acquisition-related, pension plan termination costs and legal accrual have been excluded from non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating margin and non-gaap diluted eps.
(2)   income taxes for non-gaap diluted earnings per share reflect the tax effects of non-gaap adjustments which are calculated by applying the applicable tax rate by jurisdiction to the non-gaap adjustments described in non-gaap measures, and also exclude the following non-operating income and tax items: the gaap earnings per share in 2015 reflect a tax benefit of $18.7 million related to the reversal of a portion of the u.s. valuation allowance related to reducing deferred tax assets in connection with settling the u.s. pension plan. gaap diluted earnings per share in 2014 includes (i) tax benefits of $18.1 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities established for acquisitions recorded in 2014 and (ii) a tax charge of $3.5 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in two foreign jurisdictions. gaap diluted earnings per share in 2013 includes (i) tax benefits of $36.7 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities established for acquisitions recorded in 2013, (ii) tax benefits of $3.2 million relating to the final resolution of a long standing tax litigation matter and completion of an international jurisdiction tax audit, (iii) a tax benefit of $7.9 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance in the u.s. as a result of a pension gain (decrease in unrecognized actuarial loss) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and (iv) a tax benefit of $2.6 million relating to a tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction of an acquired company. gaap diluted earnings per share in 2013 also includes a gain on investment of $0.6 million and a legal settlement gain of $5.1 million.
results of operations acquisitions
17
in 2015, we acquired coldlight (on may 7). in 2014, we acquired thingworx (on december 30), atego (on june 30) and axeda (on august 11). these acquisitions collectively added $69.2 million of revenue in 2015 and $9.8 million of revenue in 2014.
impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. currency translation affects our reported results, which are in u.s. dollars. changes in currency exchange rates, particularly for the yen and the euro, compared to the prior year decreased revenue and decreased expenses in 2015, and increased revenue and decreased expenses in 2014. if actual reported results were converted into u.s. dollars based on the corresponding prior year's foreign currency exchange rates, 2015 and 2014 revenue would have been higher by $99.7 million and lower by $2.1 million, respectively, and expenses would have been higher by $56.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively. the net impact on year-over-year results would have been an increase in operating income of $43.1 million in 2015 and a decrease in operating income of $3.0 million in 2014. the results of operations, revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis.
reclassifications through 2014, we classified revenue in three categories: 1) license; 2) service; and 3) support. because we introduced subscription-based licenses in 2015, we have revised our revenue reporting. effective with the beginning of the first quarter of 2015, we report revenue as follows: 1) license and subscriptions (l&s); 2) support; and 3) professional services. l&s revenue includes perpetual license revenue, subscription revenue and cloud services revenue. cloud service offerings were previously reflected in service revenue and cost of service revenue. consulting and training service revenue and consulting and training cost of service revenue are now referred to as professional services revenue and cost of professional services revenue. the discussion that follows reflects our revised reporting structure.
revenue revenue is reported below by line of business (license and subscription, support, and professional services), by solution area (cad, extended plm (eplm), slm and iot) and by geographic region (americas, europe, pacific rim and japan).
results include combined revenue from direct sales and our channel.

l&s revenue
2015 compared to 2014
the decline in l&s revenue in 2015 reflected year-over-year declines of 12% in the americas, 15% in europe (down 1% on a constant currency basis), and 5% in the pacific rim. year-over-year amounts in japan were flat and increased on a constant currency basis by 16%. the decreases were partially related to a higher mix of subscription bookings in 2015. results also reflected lower l&s revenue, primarily due to fewer large license transactions in 2015. this was particularly true for cad and plm in europe and the americas. iot revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of our acquisition of axeda.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted l&s revenue by $27.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014.
2014 compared to 2013
19
l&s revenue was strongest in europe and the americas, with 33% and 12% year-over-year growth, respectively, offsetting year-over-year declines in the pacific rim region, which was down 17%. cad l&s revenue was driven by double digit year-over-year growth in creo modules and upgrades, training software, and certain heritage products. slm l&s revenue in 2014 decreased due to a slower-than-expected rebuilding of our pipeline after a strong 2013.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted l&s revenue by $0.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013.
support revenue support revenue is comprised of contracts to maintain new and/or previously purchased software. support revenue has tended to be fairly stable and predictable year-to-year. however, with our transition to subscription sales, we expect support revenue will decline as customers purchase our solutions as subscriptions.
support revenue decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the effect of foreign currency exchange rates. changes in currency unfavorably impacted support revenue by $51.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014.
support revenue increased 5% ($33.8 million) in 2014 compared to 2013. changes in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant effect on support revenue in 2014.
professional services revenue consulting and training services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses, particularly of our eplm and slm solutions. expanding our service partner program, under which service engagements are referred to third party service providers, is part of our overall margin expansion strategy. additionally, over time, we anticipate implementing solutions that require fewer services. as a result, we do not expect that the amount of services we deliver will increase proportionately with any l&s revenue increases.
2015 compared to 2014
the decrease in professional services revenue for 2015 was primarily due to a 25% decrease in plm-related services and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we attribute the decline in total professional services revenue to lower plm and, to a lesser extent, cad l&s revenue and to success in expanding our service partner program.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted professional services revenue by $20.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014.
2014 compared to 2013
in 2014, professional services revenue declined slightly due to the expansion of our services partner program.

a significant percentage of our annual revenue comes from large customers in the broader manufacturing space. as a result, l&s revenue growth in our core cad and eplm products historically has correlated to growth in broader measures of the global manufacturing economy, including gdp, industrial production and manufacturing pmi. pmi data in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, suggests manufacturing economies in the u.s., china and japan are slowing, while manufacturing activity in europe has increased. for 2016, our financial guidance assumes a slower rate of growth in the manufacturing economies in the u.s., japan, and the pacific rim.
americas
20
in 2015, compared to 2014, americas l&s revenue decreased 12% due primarily to a decrease in cad and plm l&s revenue, offset in part by increases in iot l&s revenue (primarily due to our acquisition of axeda) and slm l&s revenue. professional services revenue decreased by 23% and support revenue increased by 6%.

gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects lower l&s margins due to a higher mix of cloud services revenue (due to our acquisition of axeda), which has lower margins than license revenue, and higher support volume. support revenue comprised 54% of our total revenue in 2015 compared to 51% in both 2014 and 2013.
gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects higher service margins, partially offset by lower l&s margins primarily attributable to lower l&s revenue and higher amortization of acquired purchased software. the increase in our gaap service gross margin in 2014 was due in part to improved consulting margin. service margins have improved due to cost reductions and a reduction in the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program.

2015 compared to 2014
costs and expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   restructuring charges of $43.4 million in 2015 compared to $28.4 million in 2014, primarily for severance and other related costs associated with the termination of 411 employees;
•   costs from acquired businesses (axeda, atego, thingworx and coldlight added approximately 360 employees at the date of the acquisitions);
•   costs associated with terminating our u.s. pension plan which totaled $73.2 million (including a $66.3 million settlement loss);
•   a litigation accrual of $28.2 million related to our previously disclosed china investigation; and
•   amortization of acquired intangible assets (including amortization of purchased software which is included in cost of revenue), primarily related to our acquisitions in 2014 and 2015, which was higher by $5.3 million.
these cost increases were partially offset by
•   cost savings associated with restructuring actions in 2014 and 2015;
•   the impact of foreign currency movements which favorably impacted costs and expenses by $56.6 million in 2015; and
•   a decrease in cash-based incentive compensation of $18.1 million.
2014 compared to 2013
costs and expenses in 2014, compared to 2013, decreased primarily as a result of:
•   restructuring charges, which were $23.8 million lower in 2014; and
22
•   cost savings resulting from restructuring actions in 2013.
these cost decreases were offset by:
•   costs from acquired businesses (approximately 300 employees);
•   investments we made in our internet of things business;
•   company-wide merit pay increases totaling approximately $12 million on an annualized basis, which were effective february 1, 2014;
•   increased amortization of acquired intangible assets, which was $5.2 million higher in 2014; and
•   increased acquisition-related and pension plan termination costs, which were $3.2 million higher.

in april 2015, we committed to a plan to restructure our global workforce and consolidate select facilities to increase investment in our iot business and to reduce our cost structure through organizational efficiencies in the face of significant foreign currency depreciation relative to the u.s. dollar and a more cautious outlook on global macroeconomic conditions. the restructuring actions resulted in charges of $43.4 million during 2015, including $1.4 million of facility related charges and $42.0 million of employee related termination costs, primarily related to termination benefits associated with 411 employees. this reorganization resulted in net annualized expense reductions of approximately $30 million.
in september 2014, in support of integrating businesses acquired in the prior year and the continued evolution of our business model, we committed to a plan to restructure our workforce and recorded a restructuring charge of $26.8 million attributable to termination benefits associated with 283 employees which were primarily paid in fiscal 2015. this restructuring action resulted in annualized cost savings of approximately $30 million. in addition, in 2014 we recorded restructuring charges of $1.6 million, primarily associated with the completion of the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013.
in 2013, to improve profitability, we implemented restructuring actions and recorded restructuring charges of $52.2 million, including $50.9 million for severance and related costs associated with approximately 550 employees and $1.3 million related to facility consolidations. these restructuring actions were substantially completed in 2013 and resulted in $16 million per quarter reduction in operating expenses (which was reflected in our results for 2014).
in 2015, 2014, and 2013, we made cash payments related to restructuring charges of $53.6 million, $20.6 million, and $37.2 million, respectively. at september 30, 2015, accrued expenses for unpaid restructuring charges totaled $15.3 million, which we expect to pay within the next twelve months.

foreign currency net losses: foreign currency net losses include costs of hedging contracts, certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses, and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required period-end currency re-measurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency. because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies, we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
interest income: interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances and interest on financing provided to customers as described in note b summary of significant accounting policies of "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report.
interest expense: interest expense is primarily related to interest on borrowings under our credit facility. the increase in interest expense in 2015 from 2014 and 2013 is due to higher average amounts outstanding under our credit facility. we had $668 million outstanding under the credit facility at september 30, 2015, compared to $612 million at september 30, 2014 (including $295 million borrowed in the fourth quarter of 2014 to fund our acquisition of axeda and to fund an accelerated share repurchase program) and $258 million at september 30, 2013. the balance outstanding at september 30, 2015 reflects amounts borrowed in 2015 as a result of our acquisition of coldlight. the average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 1.7% in 2015, 1.6% in 2014 and 1.7% in 2013.
other income (expense), net: the change in other income (expense), net in 2013 compared to 2014 and 2015, was due primarily to a legal settlement gain of $5.1 million recorded in 2013.

in 2015, our effective tax rate was lower than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due, in large part, to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the u.s. a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to these irish earnings. our foreign rate differential in 2015 includes a rate benefit from a business realignment completed on september 30, 2014 in which intellectual property was transferred between two wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. the realignment allows us to more efficiently manage the distribution of our products to european customers. in 2015, this realignment resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $24.0 million. we expect this realignment to result in an annual tax benefit of approximately $15 million to $20 million for the next several years, declining annually thereafter through 2021. u.s. permanent items include the tax effect of a $14.5 million expense related to a pending legal settlement. other factors impacting the effective tax rate include: the release of a valuation allowance totaling $18.7 million relating to the u.s. pension plan termination, foreign withholding taxes of $3.8 million, a tax benefit of $3.1 million relating to the reassessment of our reserve requirements and a benefit of $1.4 million in conjunction with the reorganization of our atego u.s. subsidiaries. additionally, our provision reflects a $2.1 million tax benefit related to a retroactive extension of the u.s. research and development tax credit enacted in the first quarter of 2015. this benefit was offset by a corresponding provision to increase our u.s. valuation allowance.
in 2014, our effective tax rate was lower than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the u.s. rate and the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets described below. other factors impacting the rate include foreign withholding taxes of $5.1 million and the establishment of a valuation allowance totaling $3.5 million in two foreign subsidiaries.
in 2013, our effective tax rate was lower than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due, in large part, to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets (primarily the u.s.). we recorded benefits resulting from 2013 acquisitions as described below, and a benefit of $7.9 million related to the release of a valuation allowance as a result of a pension gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in equity.  additionally, our 2013 tax provision reflected a $2.0 million provision related to a research and development (r&d) cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the u.s. a similar prepayment was made in 2012, resulting in a $7.8 million provision in that year. this impact was offset by a corresponding increase in our valuation allowance in the u.s. other factors impacting the rate include our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the u.s. rate, foreign withholding taxes of $6.0 million and non-cash tax benefits of $5.3 million recorded as a result of the conclusion of tax audits in several foreign jurisdictions.
acquisitions in 2014 and 2013 were accounted for as business combinations.  assets acquired, including the fair value of acquired tangible assets, intangible assets and assumed liabilities were recorded, and we recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $21.6 million and $38.7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to the tax effect of the acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for income tax purposes.  these deferred tax liabilities reduced our net deferred tax asset balance and resulted in a tax benefit of $18.1 million and $36.7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, to decrease our valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we have recorded a valuation allowance.  as these decreases in the valuation allowance are not part of the accounting for business combinations (the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed), they were recorded as an income tax benefit.
we have concluded, based on the weight of available evidence, that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our u.s. net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future. we will continue to reassess whether a valuation allowance is required each financial reporting period.
in the normal course of business, ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service (irs) in the united states. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions. audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items, limitations on net operating losses and tax credits. although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates.
27
our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings, which are taxed at rates different from the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate, as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law. further, our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year, including from quarter to quarter, due to items arising from discrete events, including settlements of tax audits and assessments, the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties, and acquisitions of other companies.
non-gaap measures the non-gaap measures presented in the above discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are:
•   non-gaap revenue-gaap revenue
•   non-gaap gross margin-gaap gross margin
•   non-gaap operating income-gaap operating income
•   non-gaap operating margin-gaap operating margin
•   non-gaap net income-gaap net income (loss)
•   non-gaap diluted earnings per share-gaap diluted earnings (loss) per share the non-gaap measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue, acquired deferred costs, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets expense, acquisition-related charges, restructuring charges, pension plan termination-related costs, identified discrete items included in non-operating other income (expense), net and the related tax effects of the preceding items, and any other identified tax items. these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap.
fair value of acquired deferred revenue is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation.
stock-based compensation expense is non-cash expense relating to stock-based awards issued to executive officers, employees and outside directors, consisting of restricted stock, stock options and restricted stock units.
amortization of acquired intangible assets expense is a non-cash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions. we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry.
acquisition-related charges included in general and administrative expenses include direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities, including transaction fees, due diligence costs, severance and professional fees. in addition, subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisition-related charges. these costs are not considered part of our normal operations as the occurrence and amount will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions.
u.s. pension plan termination-related costs include charges related to our plan that we began terminating in the second quarter of 2014. costs associated with the termination are not considered part of our ongoing operations.
pending legal settlement accrual includes amounts related to the china matter described in impact of an investigation in china.
restructuring charges include excess facility restructuring charges and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy and not as part of our normal operations. these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan.
we use these non-gaap measures, and we believe that they assist our investors, to make period-to-period comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not, in our view, indicative of our core operating results. we believe that these non-gaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business, and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicated internally and externally, for managing our business and evaluating our performance. we believe that providing non-gaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies. in addition, compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-gaap measures.
the items excluded from the non-gaap measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur. accordingly, the non-gaap measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap.

(3)   income tax adjustments reflect the tax effects of non-gaap adjustments which are calculated by applying the applicable tax rate by jurisdiction to the non-gaap adjustments listed above, and also include any identified tax items. in the fourth quarter of 2012, a valuation allowance was established against our u.s. net deferred tax assets and in the fourth quarter of 2014 a valuation allowance was established against net deferred tax assets in two foreign jurisdictions. as the u.s. is profitable on a non-gaap basis, the non-gaap tax provision is being calculated assuming there is no u.s. valuation allowance. additionally, the following identified tax items have been excluded from the non-gaap tax results. the gaap diluted earnings per share in 2015 includes an $18.7 million release of valuation allowance related to the u.s. pension plan termination. gaap diluted earnings per share in 2014 includes (i) tax benefits of $18.1 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities established for acquisitions recorded in 2014 and (ii) a tax charge of $3.5 million to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in two foreign jurisdictions. gaap diluted earnings per share in 2013 includes (i) tax benefits of $36.7 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities established for acquisitions recorded in 2013, (ii) tax benefits of $3.2 million relating to the final resolution of a long standing tax litigation matter and completion of an international jurisdiction tax audit, (iii) a tax benefit of $7.9 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance in the u.s. as a result of a pension gain (decrease in unrecognized actuarial loss) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and (iv) a tax benefit of $2.6 million relating to a tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction of an acquired company.
(4)   diluted earnings per share impact of non-gaap adjustments is calculated by dividing the dollar amount of the non-gaap adjustment by the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the respective year.
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues, results of operations, and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. these estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty, and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time.
the accounting policies, methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b summary of significant accounting policies of "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report. the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved:
•   revenue recognition;
•   accounting for income taxes;
•   valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations;
•   valuation of goodwill;
•   accounting for pensions; and
30
•   legal contingencies.
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate, and different estimates that we could have used, or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
accounting policies, guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators. these rule makers and/or regulators may promulgate interpretations, guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
revenue recognition our sources of revenue include: (1) license and subscription, (2) support and (3) professional services. we record revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by asc 985-605, software-revenue recognition when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred (generally, fob shipping point or electronic distribution), (3) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (4) collection is probable. we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. our primary judgments involve the following:
•   determining whether collection is probable;
•   assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable;
•   determining whether service arrangements, including modifications and customization of the underlying software, are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software and thus would result in the revenue for license and service elements of an agreement being recorded separately; and
•   determining the fair value of services and support elements included in multiple-element arrangements, which is the basis for allocating and deferring revenue for such services and support.
our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force. in addition, we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers. revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sell-through basis; that is, when we deliver the product to the end-user customer. we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller. we do not offer contractual rights of return, stock balancing, or price protection to our resellers, and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date. as a result, we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns.
at the time of each sale transaction, we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer. revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable. in making this assessment, we consider customer credit-worthiness and historical payment experience. at that same time, we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties. in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable, we consider the payment terms of the transaction, including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms, and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions, among other factors. we have periodically provided financing to credit-worthy customers with payment terms up to 24 months. if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable, revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met. our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions. however, if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision, we record revenue only upon the earlier of (1) receipt of written acceptance from the customer or (2) expiration of the acceptance period.
generally, our contracts are accounted for individually. however, when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other, it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts.
license and subscription license and subscription (l&s) revenue includes revenue from three primary sources: (1) sales of perpetual licenses, (2) subscription-based licenses, and (3) cloud services.
under perpetual license arrangements, we generally recognize license revenue up front upon shipment to the customer. we use the residual method to recognize revenue from perpetual license software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists, and the elements of the arrangement qualify for separate accounting as described below. under the residual method, the fair value of the
31
undelivered elements (i.e., support and services) based on our vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of fair value is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements (i.e., perpetual software license). if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered elements does not exist, all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those elements has occurred or when fair values can be established. we determine vsoe of the fair value of services and support revenue based upon our recent pricing for those elements when sold separately. for certain transactions, vsoe is determined based on a substantive renewal clause within a customer contract. our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type, purchase volume, sales channel and customer location. we review services and support sold separately on a periodic basis and update, when appropriate, our vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience.
subscription-based licenses include the right for a customer to use our licenses and receive related support for a specified term and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. when sold in arrangements with other elements, vsoe of fair value is established for the subscription-based licenses through the use of a substantive renewal clause within the customer contract for a combined annual fee that includes the term-based license and related support.
cloud services reflect recurring revenues that include fees for hosting and application management of customers' perpetual or subscription-based licenses. generally, customers have the right to terminate the cloud services contract and take possession of the licenses without a significant penalty. when cloud services are sold as part of a multi-element transaction, revenue is allocated to cloud services based on vsoe, and recognized ratably over the contractual term beginning on the commencement dates of each contract, which is the date the services are made available to the customer. vsoe is established for cloud services either through a substantive stated renewal option or stated contractual overage rates, as these rates represent the value the customer is willing to pay on a standalone basis. in addition, cloud services include set-up fees, which are recognized ratably over the contract term or the expected customer life, whichever is longer.
support support contracts generally include rights to unspecified upgrades (when and if available), telephone and internet-based support, updates and bug fixes. support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract on a straight-line basis.
professional services our software arrangements often include implementation, consulting and training services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement. when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software, we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements, provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services (i.e. vsoe of fair value). we consider various factors in assessing whether a service is not essential to the functionality of the software, including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such services (i.e. consulting and implementation) in coordination with dedicated customer personnel, and whether the services result in significant modification or customization of the software's functionality. when professional services qualify for separate accounting, professional services revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed. professional services revenues under fixed-priced contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed using a proportionate performance model with hours or costs as the input method of attribution.
when we provide professional services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software, the arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements, and the license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting. under such arrangements, consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input. in these circumstances, we separate license revenue from service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vsoe of fair value of the consulting services as service revenue, and the residual portion as license revenue. under the percentage-of-completion method, we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or "not to exceed" fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion. adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known. when total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses when identified. the use of the proportionate performance and percentage-of-completion methods of accounting require significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs or hours (hours being a proxy for costs), including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs.
reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in service revenue, with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue.
training services include on-site and classroom training. training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided.
32
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction. there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain; as a result, our calculations involve estimates by management. some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue-sharing, cost-reimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions. if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements, that revision could affect our tax liability.
the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense.
as of september 30, 2015, we have a valuation allowance of $166.5 million against net deferred tax assets in the u.s. and a valuation allowance of $31.7 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. we have concluded, based on the weight of available evidence, that a full valuation allowance continues to be required against our u.s. net deferred tax assets as they are not more likely than not to be realized in the future. we will continue to reassess our valuation allowance requirements each financial reporting period.
the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards, the majority of which do not expire. there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits.
we have not provided for u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on foreign unrepatriated earnings as it is our current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the u.s. unless it can be done with no significant tax cost, with the exception of a newly formed foreign holding company.  there was no impact to this assertion in the current year.  in the future, we expect to incur annual deferred tax expense of $11 million.  if we decide to change this assertion in the future to repatriate any additional non-u.s. earnings, we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings. the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries for which u.s. income taxes have not been provided totaled approximately $1,915 million and $613 million as of september 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in 2015, we reorganized certain european entities to simplify our legal and reporting structure.  this reorganization resulted in a transfer of assets between subsidiaries and triggered a gain that resulted in an increase in unremitted earnings. the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings cannot be practicably determined at this time.
in the normal course of business, ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service (irs) in the united states. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions. audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items, limitations on net operating losses and tax credits. although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates.
valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology, core technology, tradenames, customer lists and contracts, and software support agreements and related relationships. developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility. core technology represents a combination of processes, inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products. customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company's installed base. we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model. critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to:
•   future expected cash flows from software license sales, customer support agreements, customer contracts and related customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and trademarks and trade names;
•   expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed;
33
•   the acquired company's brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used by the combined company; and
•   discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows.
in addition, we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset.
net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations. except for deferred revenues, net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company, if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date. the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company's software support contracts.
in addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values. subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations.
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable, we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment. this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset's remaining life. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset, determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset.
valuation of goodwill our goodwill totaled $1,069.0 million and $1,012.5 million as of september 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we have two operating segments: (1) software products and (2) services. we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. our reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. as of september 30, 2015 and 2014, goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products reportable segment was $1,297.9 million and $1,283.0 million, respectively, and attributable to our services reportable segment was $62.4 million and $66.4 million, respectively. we test goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of our fiscal year, or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value. factors we consider important (on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis, as applicable) that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period, or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value.
we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as of july 4, 2015 and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date. to conduct our test of goodwill, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. if the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its implied fair value. we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models. those models require estimates of future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital, terminal values based on revenue multiples, and discount rates for each reporting unit. we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and industry data. the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was more than double its carrying value as of july 4, 2015.
accounting for pensions we sponsor several international pension plans. we make assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of these plans. these key assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate
34
used to determine the present value of benefit obligations. in selecting the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan. this includes considering the plans' asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plans. the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due. the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated, which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years and/or require higher than expected cash contributions.
we previously maintained a u.s. defined benefit pension plan (the plan) that covered certain persons who were employees of computervision corporation (acquired by us in 1998). benefits under the plan were frozen in 1990. in the second quarter of 2014, we began the process of terminating the plan, and we completed the plan termination in the fourth quarter of 2015. as of september 30, 2014, we valued the projected benefit obligations of the u.s. plan based on the present value of estimated costs to settle the liabilities through a combination of lump sum payments to participants and purchasing annuities from an insurance company. this reflected an estimate of how many participants we expected will accept a lump sum offering, and an estimate of lump sum payouts for those participants. liabilities expected to be settled through annuity contracts were estimated based on future benefit payments, discounted based on current interest rates that correspond to the liability payouts, adjusted to reflect a premium that would be assessed by the insurer.
we settled the liabilities in 2015 and recognized a settlement loss of $66.3 million based on the projected benefit obligations and assets measured as of the dates the settlements occurred. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we contributed $25 million to fully fund the plan.
in determining our u.s. pension cost for 2015, 2014, and 2013, we used a discount rate of 3.80%, 4.90% and 4.00%, respectively, and an expected return on plan assets of 1.35% for 2015, 7.25% for 2014 and 2013. the decrease in the expected return in 2015 was because assets were moved to fixed income security, in anticipation of terminating the u.s. pension plan.
certain of our international subsidiaries (principally germany) also sponsor pension plans. accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of country-specific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets. we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that, in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates, are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans. the discount rate for germany was selected with reference to a spot-rate yield curve based on the yields of aa-rated euro-denominated corporate bonds. in addition, our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience, such as mortality rates. in determining our pension cost for 2015, 2014, and 2013, we used weighted average discount rates of 2.4%, 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively, and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 5.8%, 5.7% and 5.4%, respectively. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, our actual return on plan assets for all plans was $1.9 million, $15.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively. if actual returns are below our expected rates of return, it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans.
as of september 30, 2015 and 2014, our plans in total were underfunded, representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, by $20.2 million and $61.2 million, respectively. the projected benefit obligation as of september 30, 2015 was determined using a weighted average discount rate of 2.2% for our international plans. the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. total gaap net periodic pension cost was $73.9 million in 2015, including a $66.3 million settlement loss related to the u.s. plan termination, and we expect it to be approximately $2 million in 2016. a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30, 2015 by approximately $1 million. a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30, 2015 by approximately $7 million.
legal contingencies we are periodically subject to various legal claims and involved in various legal proceedings. we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. further, estimates of this nature are highly subjective, and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. as additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations.

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds. the portfolio is invested in short-term instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed. at september 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents totaled $273.4 million, down from $293.7 million at september 30, 2014, reflecting $179.9 million in operating cash flow, $56.3 million of net amounts borrowed under our credit facility ($100 million borrowed in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of our acquisition of coldlight, net of amounts repaid in 2015), partially offset by $99 million used to acquire coldlight, and $64.9 million used to repurchase common shares outstanding.
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $179.9 million in 2015, compared to $304.6 million in 2014 and $224.7 million in 2013. cash provided by operations was lower due to lower net income, higher restructuring payments ($53.6 million in 2015 compared to $20.6 million in 2014 and $37.2 million in 2013) and contributions to pension plans, which were higher by $33.8 million in 2015. cash paid for income taxes was $30.1 million, $25.5 million, and $35.4 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

in both the second and fourth quarters of 2014, we refinanced our credit facility as described in credit facility below. we incurred $7.9 million of origination costs in 2014 in connection with entering into and amending the new and previous credit facilities. in 2015, we borrowed $100 million as a result of the purchase of coldlight and $64.9 million to repurchase shares. in 2014, we borrowed $280 million to finance acquisitions and $125 million to repurchase shares under an accelerated share repurchase transaction. proceeds from issuance of common stock reflects stock option exercises. stock option exercises totaled 0.1 million shares in 2014 and 0.5 million shares in 2013. stock option exercises were only 6,000 (approximately) in 2015. assuming no additional stock options are granted, future proceeds from option exercises will be immaterial.
share repurchase authorization our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million shares of our common stock. our board of directors has periodically authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock. we were authorized to repurchase up to $100 million worth of shares with cash from operations for each of our fiscal years 2014 and 2013. additionally, on august 4, 2014, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $600 million of our common stock through september 30, 2017.  we intend to use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make such repurchases.  pursuant to this repurchase authorization, in the fourth quarter of 2014 we entered into the $125 million accelerated share repurchase agreement described below.  we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $64.9 million in 2015, 5.1 million shares at a cost of $224.9 million in 2014 (including $125 million purchased through accelerated share repurchase agreement described below), and 3.1 million shares at a cost of $74.9 million in 2013. all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued.
on august 14, 2014, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement with a major financial institution ("bank"). the asr allows us to buy a large number of shares immediately at a purchase price determined by an average market price over a period of time. under the asr, we agreed to purchase $125.0 million of our common stock, in total, with an initial delivery to us in august 2014 of 2.3 million shares. we settled the asr in december 2014 and the bank delivered to us 1.1 million additional shares.
credit facility in november 2015, we entered into a multi-currency credit facility with a syndicate of sixteen banks for which jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. acts as administrative agent. this credit facility amended and restated our credit facility described in note h in its entirety. we expect to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of businesses, share repurchases and working capital requirements.
the credit facility consists of a $1 billion revolving loan commitment which may be increased by an additional $500 million (in the form of revolving loans or term loans, or a combination thereof) if the existing or additional lenders are willing to make such increased commitments. the revolving loan commitment does not require amortization of principal and may be repaid in whole or in part prior to the scheduled maturity date at our option without penalty or premium. the credit facility matures on september 15, 2019, when all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full.
ptc and certain eligible foreign subsidiaries are eligible borrowers under the credit facility. the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by ptc and certain of its material domestic subsidiaries. in addition, ptc and certain of its material domestic subsidiaries' owned property (including equity interests) is subject to first priority perfected liens in favor of the lenders of this credit facility. 100% of the voting equity interests of certain of ptc's domestic subsidiaries and 65% of its material first-tier foreign subsidiaries are pledged as collateral for the obligations under the credit facility.
37
as of november 4, 2015, we had $718 million outstanding under the credit facility.
the credit facility limits ptc's and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: incur liens or guarantee obligations; pay dividends (other than to ptc) and make other distributions; make investments and enter into joint ventures; dispose of assets; and engage in transactions with affiliates, except on an arms-length basis. under the credit facility, ptc and its material domestic subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in, or loan to, ptc's foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding $75 million for any purpose and an additional $200 million for acquisitions of businesses. in addition, under the credit facility, ptc and its subsidiaries must maintain the following financial ratios:
•   a total leverage ratio, defined as consolidated total indebtedness to the consolidated trailing four quarters ebitda, not to exceed
◦   prior to a covenant modification trigger event (incurring unsecured indebtedness of not less than $200 million in aggregate) (x) 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter ending on or prior to july 2, 2016, and (y) 3.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter ending on or after september 30, 2016
◦   on and after a covenant modification trigger event, 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.
•   a senior secured leverage ratio, defined as consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated trailing four quarters ebitda, not to exceed 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter ending after a covenant modification trigger event, and
•   a fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated trailing four quarters ebitda less consolidated capital expenditures to consolidated fixed charges, of not less than 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.
any failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants of the credit facility would prevent ptc from being able to borrow additional funds, and would constitute a default, permitting the lenders to, among other things, accelerate the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, under the credit facility and to terminate the credit facility. a change in control of ptc, as defined in the agreement, also constitutes an event of default, permitting the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and terminate the credit facility.
expectations for fiscal 2016
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements (which we expect to be $37 million in 2016) through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known long-term capital requirements. in 2016, we expect to pay $28 million to settle the china matter and to repurchase $80 million of our stock. our ability to repurchase shares is subject to our having sufficient cash available and maintaining compliance with credit facility covenants.
we evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions. our expected uses of cash could change, our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete additional acquisitions.
we have substantial cash requirements in the united states and a significant portion of our cash is generated and held outside of the united states. at september 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $75.5 million in the united states, $66.7 million in europe, $89.2 million in the pacific rim (including india), $20.8 million in japan and $21.1 million in other non-u.s. countries. we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash and cash equivalents, future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our credit facility, are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and known capital requirements.
in november of 2015, we acquired the vuforia business from qualcomm connected experiences, inc. for $65 million in cash.
contractual obligations at september 30, 2015, our contractual obligations were as follows:

(1)   credit facility amounts above include required principal repayments and interest and commitment fees based on the balance outstanding as of september 30, 2015 and the interest rate in effect as of september 30, 2015, 1.875%. pursuant to our amended and restated credit facility signed november 4, 2015, the term loan was converted into a revolving loan. the credit facility matures on september 15, 2019, when all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full. future payments under this new agreement will be: $13.8 million in less than one year, $28.6 million in one to three years, and $732.6 million in three to five years.
(2)   the future minimum lease payments above include minimum future lease payments for excess facilities under noncancelable operating leases. these leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment and, as such, are not included on our balance sheet. see note i commitments and contingencies of "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report for additional information regarding our operating leases.
(3)   purchase obligations represent minimum commitments due to third parties, including royalty contracts, research and development contracts, telecommunication contracts, information technology maintenance contracts in support of internal-use software and hardware and other marketing and consulting contracts. contracts for which our commitment is variable, based on volumes, with no fixed minimum quantities, and contracts that can be canceled without payment penalties have been excluded. the purchase obligations included above are in addition to amounts included in current liabilities and prepaid expenses recorded on our september 30, 2015 consolidated balance sheet.
(4)   these obligations relate to our international pension plans. these liabilities are not subject to fixed payment terms. payments have been estimated based on the plans' current funded status, planned employer contributions and actuarial assumptions. in addition, we may, at our discretion, make additional voluntary contributions to the plans. see note m pension plans of "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report for further discussion.
(5)   as of september 30, 2015, we had recorded total unrecognized tax benefits of $14.1 million. this liability is not subject to fixed payment terms and the amount and timing of payments, if any, which we will make related to this liability, are not known. see note g income taxes of "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report for additional information.
as of september 30, 2015, we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately $4 million (of which $1.1 million was collateralized), primarily related to our corporate headquarters lease in needham, massachusetts.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated (to the extent of our ownership interest therein) into our financial statements. we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us.
recent accounting pronouncements revenue recognition in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (the fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers: topic 606 (asu 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under u.s. gaap. the core principle of asu 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing u.s. gaap
39
including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. asu 2014-09 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within asu 2014-09; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying asu 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per asu 2014-09. we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.
debt issuance costs in april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-03, interest-imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30), to simplify the required presentation of debt issuance costs. the amended guidance requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than as an asset. it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, our fiscal 2017, with early adoption permitted. the new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

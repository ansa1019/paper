item 1a.   risk factors risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
successful integration of biomet and anticipated benefits of the biomet merger are not assured and integration matters could divert attention of management away from operations. also, the merger could have an adverse effect on our business relationships.
although biomet has become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours, it is initially continuing its operations on a basis that is separate from the legacy zimmer operations. there can be no assurance that biomet will be able to maintain and grow its business and operations. in addition, the market segments in which biomet operates may experience declines in demand and/or new competitors. customers, suppliers and other third parties with business relationships with us and/or biomet may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with us and/or biomet as a result of the merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us and/or biomet or otherwise.
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the biomet merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the legacy businesses. integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of biomet with ours involves complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. this process is time-consuming and expensive, disrupts the businesses of both companies and may not result in the full benefits expected by us, including cost synergies expected to arise from supply chain efficiencies and overlapping general and administrative functions. the potential difficulties, and resulting costs and delays, include:
   managing a larger combined company;

   consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;

   issues in integrating manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities, research and development and sales forces;

   difficulties attracting and retaining key personnel;

   loss of customers and suppliers and inability to attract new customers and suppliers;

   unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;

   incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing, administration and other systems and processes; and

   unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the merger or biomets business.

additionally, the integration of our and biomets operations, products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and other internal resources. the attention of our management may be directed towards integration considerations and may be diverted from our day-to-day business operations, and matters related to the integration may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to us. the diversion of managements attention, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.
even if our businesses are successfully integrated, we may not realize the full benefits of the merger, including anticipated synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities, within the expected timeframe or at all. in addition, we expect to incur significant integration and restructuring expenses to realize synergies. however, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. these expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all.
any of these matters could adversely affect our businesses or harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.
we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the biomet merger and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations.
we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the biomet merger. at december 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $11.6 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion at december 31, 2014. we funded the cash portion of the merger consideration, the pay-off of certain indebtedness of biomet and the payment of transaction-related expenses through a combination of available cash-on-hand and proceeds from debt financings, including proceeds from a $7.65 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes in march 2015, and borrowings of $3.0 billion under our $4.35 billion credit agreement. as of december 31, 2015, our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding capital leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months are expected to be $339.8 million. as a result of the increase in our debt, demands on our cash resources have increased. the increased level of debt could, among other things:
   require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

10
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report
   limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

   restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;

   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

   adversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase and our ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired;

   adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and

   limit our ability to apply proceeds from a future offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.

if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
our industry is subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the federal false claims act, the federal anti-kickback statute, the federal stark law, the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws. in addition, we are subject to various federal and foreign laws concerning anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters, sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations. violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the u.s., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including medicare, medicaid and veterans administration health programs. these laws are administered by, among others, the doj, the office of inspector general of the u.s. department of health and human services (oig-hhs), the sec, the office of foreign assets control of the u.s. department of the treasury (ofac), the bureau of industry and security of the u.s. department of commerce and state attorneys general. the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to change.
biomet is involved in ongoing governmental investigations, the results of which may adversely impact our business and results of operations. further, if biomet fails to comply with the terms of the dpa that it entered into in march 2012, it may be subject to criminal prosecution and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
on march 26, 2012, biomet entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (dpa) with the doj and a consent to final judgment (consent) with the sec related to an investigation by the doj and the sec into possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) in the marketing and sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. pursuant to the dpa, the doj agreed to defer prosecution of biomet in connection with those matters, provided that biomet satisfies its obligations under the dpa over the term of the dpa. the dpa had a three-year term and provided that it could be extended in the sole discretion of the doj for an additional year.
pursuant to the consent, biomet consented to the entry of a final judgment which, among other things, permanently enjoined biomet from violating the provisions of the fcpa. in addition, pursuant to the terms of the dpa, an independent external compliance monitor was appointed to review biomets compliance with the dpa, particularly in relation to biomets international sales practices. the consent that biomet entered into with the sec mirrors the dpas provisions with respect to the compliance monitor.
in october 2013, biomet became aware of certain alleged improprieties regarding its operations in brazil and mexico, including alleged improprieties that predated the entry of the dpa. biomet retained counsel and other experts to investigate both matters. based on the results of the ongoing investigations, biomet has terminated, suspended or otherwise disciplined certain of the employees and executives involved in these matters, and has taken certain other remedial measures. additionally, pursuant to the terms of the dpa, in april 2014 and thereafter, biomet disclosed these matters to and discussed these matters with the independent compliance monitor and the doj and sec. on july 2, 2014 and july 13, 2015, the sec issued subpoenas to biomet requiring that biomet produce certain documents relating to such matters. these matters remain under investigation by the doj.
on march 13, 2015, the doj informed biomet that the dpa and the independent compliance monitors appointment have been extended for an additional year. on april 2, 2015, at the request of the staff of the sec, biomet consented to an amendment to the final judgment to extend the term of the compliance monitors appointment for one year from the date of entry of the amended final judgment.
pursuant to the dpa, the doj has sole discretion to determine whether conduct by biomet constitutes a violation or breach of the dpa. the doj has informed biomet that it retains its rights under the dpa to bring further action against biomet relating to the conduct in brazil and mexico referenced above or the violations set forth in the dpa. the doj could, among other things, revoke the dpa or prosecute biomet and/or the involved employees and executives. biomet continues to cooperate with the sec and doj and expects that discussions with the sec and the doj will continue.
in june 2013, biomet received a subpoena from the u.s. attorneys office for the district of new jersey requesting various documents relating to the fitting of custom-fabricated or custom-fitted orthoses, or bracing, to patients in new jersey, texas and washington. biomet has produced responsive documents and is fully cooperating with the request of the u.s. attorneys office. we may need to devote significant time and resources to this inquiry and can give no assurances as to its final outcome.
in july 2011, biomet received an administrative subpoena from ofac, requesting documents concerning the export of products to iran. ofac informed biomet that the subpoena related to allegations that biomet may have been involved in
11
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report unauthorized sales of dental products to iran. biomet is fully cooperating in the investigation and submitted its response to the subpoena in october 2011. we may need to devote significant time and resources to this inquiry and can give no assurances as to its final outcome.
in february 2010, biomet received a subpoena from the oig-hhs requesting various documents relating to agreements or arrangements between physicians and biomets interpore cross subsidiary for the period from 1999 through the date of the subpoena and the marketing and sales activities associated with interpore cross spinal products. biomet is fully cooperating in the investigation. we may need to devote significant time and resources to this inquiry and can give no assurances as to its final outcome.
as a result of the merger, all obligations and liabilities of biomet related to the above matters have been assumed by us as the combined company. from time to time, we are, and may continue to be, the subject of additional investigations. if, as a result of the investigations described above or any additional investigations, we are found to have violated one or more applicable laws, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. if some of our existing business practices are challenged as unlawful, we may have to modify those practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs.
both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations. compliance with the fdas requirements, including the quality system regulation, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda, which may result in observations on form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement. if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the fda could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such devices, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. the fda may also impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. the fda may also recommend prosecution to the doj. any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in 2012, we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain processes pertaining to products manufactured at our ponce, puerto rico manufacturing facility. in june 2015, biomet received a warning letter from the fda that requested additional information to allow the fda to evaluate the adequacy of biomets responses to certain form 483 observations issued following an inspection of biomets zhejiang, china manufacturing facility in january 2015. as of december 31, 2015, these warning letters remained pending. until the violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda, the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the fda may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the international standards organization. if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.
interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have manufacturing sites all over the world. in some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disaster-related events, or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the quality system regulation and good manufacturing practice requirements, equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. in the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand. in the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals. as a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
12
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.
we operate in a highly competitive environment. our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies. to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies. competition is primarily on the basis of:
   technology;

   innovation;

   quality;

   reputation; and

   customer service.

in markets outside of the u.s., other factors influence competition as well, including:
   local distribution systems;

   complex regulatory environments; and

   differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

our competitors may:
   have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

   respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

   undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

   adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

   be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.

any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
our marketing success in the u.s. and abroad depends significantly upon our agents and distributors sales and service expertise in the marketplace. many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents detailed knowledge of products and instruments. further, the legacy independent agents and distributors of us or biomet may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with us and/or biomet as a result of the merger. a loss of a significant number of the combined companys agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of:
   evolving customer needs;

   changing demographics;

   slowing industry growth rates;

   declines in the reconstructive implant market;

   the introduction of new products and technologies;

   evolving surgical philosophies; and

   evolving industry standards.

without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. if that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer. the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
   properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

   commercialize new products in a timely manner;

   manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time;

   differentiate our offerings from competitors offerings;

   achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

   satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost procedures;

   innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and

   provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

in addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors:
   entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

   the need for regulatory clearance; and

   uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production. in addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.
if third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed.
we sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. these third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices.
in addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. if third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased
13
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets. if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.
the ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs. group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organizations affiliated hospitals and other members. if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturers products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement. our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the u.s., which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.
we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived over 40 percent of our net sales in 2015 from outside the u.s. we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations. our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:
   changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

   unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;

   differing local product preferences and product requirements;

   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

   diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the u.s.;

   trade protection measures and import or export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our operating costs;

   foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;

   complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

   extraterritorial effects of u.s. laws such as the fcpa;

   effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the uk bribery act;

   difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

   labor force instability;

   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

   political and economic instability.

violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party vendors and we outsource some key manufacturing activities. certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors manufacturing processes. a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
moreover, we are subject to the secs rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries. we filed reports on form sd with the sec regarding such matters in june 2014 and 2015 and are required to file on an annual basis going forward. this rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. in addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products. we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. as a result, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders.
we may have additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions
14
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates. in addition, there have been proposals to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.
we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.
a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan. the u.s. dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. significant increases in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen, as well as other currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.
pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. in the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. as discussed further in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom® acetabular component (durom cup), certain products within the nexgen knee system, and the m2a-magnum hip system. the majority of the durom cup cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation (mdl) in the district of new jersey (in re: zimmer durom hip cup products liability litigation); the majority of the nexgen knee system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of illinois (in re: zimmer nexgen knee implant products liability litigation); and the majority of the m2a-magnum hip system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of indiana (in re: biomet m2a magnum hip implant products liability litigation). we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products. any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend. product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.
although we maintain third-party product liability insurance coverage, we have substantial self-insured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement. furthermore, even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits. product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.
claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly. at any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. we rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so. while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents, trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. further, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage. third parties could obtain patents that
15
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
in addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries. if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property, our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue.
we also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation with security measures, including the use of non-disclosure and other agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.
we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.
in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our information systems and data, our business could be adversely affected.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure. as a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, including the biomet merger, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. in addition, third parties may attempt to gain unauthorized access to our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients or our proprietary information. if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could:
   lose existing customers;

   have difficulty attracting new customers;

   have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing;

   have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud;

   have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals;

   have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed;

   incur increased operating expenses;

   incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach; or

   suffer other adverse consequences.

while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful or that systems issues will not arise in the future. any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.
future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results.
our assets include intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2015, we had $9.9 billion in goodwill. the goodwill results from our acquisition activity, including the biomet merger, and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable. if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline, we could be required, under current u.s. accounting rules, to record a non-cash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment. any write-off of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.
certain investors continue to have influence over us, including in connection with decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit other stockholders ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.
in connection with our acquisition of biomet, we entered into a stockholders agreement (the stockholders agreement) with lvb acquisition holding, llc and its owners party thereto (collectively, the sponsors). the sponsors and certain of their affiliates currently hold approximately 9.4% of our common stock. in addition, representatives of the sponsors currently have the right to designate two members of our board of directors. as a result, the sponsors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction (and the terms thereof).
additionally, the sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. one
16
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report or more of these entities may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.
future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.
pursuant to the stockholders agreement, we have filed a shelf registration statement with the sec, registering shares of our common stock for resale by the sponsors. two of the sponsors recently completed the sale of approximately 11.0 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering. the sponsors own approximately 18.6 million additional shares that may be offered and sold under the resale registration statement. the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by us or our existing stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.
anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, our restated by-laws and the delaware general corporation law may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.
these provisions provide for, among other things:
   the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without further stockholder action;

   advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;

   certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; and

          the prohibition on engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the time at which a person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met, as set forth in section 203 of the delaware general corporation law.

these anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third partys offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. as a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.
our restated by-laws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.
our restated by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the state of delaware (or, if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated by-laws, as either may be amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in 2015. while the particular material weakness has been remediated as of december 31, 2015, additional material weaknesses or relapses of this material weakness could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements.
we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the exchange act. as discussed in part ii, item 9a of this report, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended september 30, 2015 related to the control over accounting for non-routine, complex transactions. a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. during the fourth quarter of 2015, we executed our remediation plans to address the material weakness. however, if the remedial measures are not adhered to or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our

item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. certain amounts in the 2014 and 2013 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation. additionally, as more fully described in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report, due to accounting errors in prior periods, certain amounts in the 2014 and 2013 consolidated financial statements have been revised.
on june 24, 2015, we completed our merger with biomet and its results of operations have been included in our results starting on that date. the biomet merger is a transformational event for us and has had significant effects on all aspects of our business. accordingly, our revenues and expenses increased significantly in the year ended december 31, 2015.
in portions of this discussion and analysis, we also present sales information on an unaudited, pro forma basis for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. this pro forma information includes zimmer and biomet sales in those periods as if the merger occurred on january 1, 2014. accordingly, the pro forma net sales information for periods prior to the closing date includes the net sales of biomet, but does not include the impact of the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets. we believe this pro forma analysis is beneficial for investors because it represents how the merged companies may have performed on a combined basis in 2015 and 2014. such pro forma net sales information may not be indicative, however, of future operating performance.
executive level overview
2015 results the last half of 2015 was significantly affected by our biomet integration activities. we made significant progress by accomplishing important commercial integration milestones across all geographies. we largely completed the appointment of our global sales leaders. we also began to execute our integration roadmaps designed to capture the net operating synergy opportunities presented by this merger.
our results have been significantly impacted by the biomet merger. our sales for 2015 increased by 28.3 percent primarily due to the biomet merger. volume/mix growth from the merger was partially offset by the negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and continued, but stable, pricing pressure in all of our geographic regions.
our net earnings decreased in 2015 compared to 2014. the primary driver of the lower net earnings was expense incurred in connection with the biomet merger. as a result of the merger, we recognized significant expenses due to stepping up the acquired inventory to fair value, intangible asset amortization, the acceleration of the vesting of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stock-based awards, retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and third-party sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date, severance expense, contract termination expense related to agreements with independent agents, distributors, suppliers and lessors, a loss related to a call premium on biomet debt we redeemed, third party fees, and other acquisition and integration charges. interest expense also increased due to financing-related costs for the merger.
2016 outlook we expect our sales in the first half of 2016 to be higher than in the first half of 2015, on a reported basis, since the biomet merger was completed midway through 2015. on a pro forma basis, we expect revenues to be approximately flat in 2016 compared to 2015. this estimate assumes foreign currency exchange rates will decrease revenues by approximately 2 percent, continued pricing pressure will decrease revenues by approximately 2 percent, and our volume/mix growth will be approximately 4 percent. we expect pro forma sales growth will improve in the last half of the year compared to the first half as our sales force stabilizes, we take advantage of cross-selling opportunities and we anniversary out of many sales force dissynergies caused by the merger.
we expect cost of products sold to continue to realize significant expense related to stepping up acquired biomet inventory to fair value. similarly, our intangible asset amortization expense will increase significantly as we recognize a full year of intangible asset amortization from the biomet merger. we expect research and development (r&d) expense for the year to be in a range of 4.5 to 5.0 percent of sales. selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense is expected to approximate 37 percent of sales, which is an improvement from 2015 as we realize synergies from the merger. we estimate special items expense will continue to be significant as we continue our integration activities. however, we expect special items expense will be less in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the significant, initial expenses incurred in 2015 for the integration. interest expense will increase in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the debt borrowed in 2015 to fund the biomet merger.
results of operations we analyze sales by three geographies, the americas, emea and asia pacific, and by the following product
22
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report categories: knees, hips, s.e.t., dental, spine & cmf and other. this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments, which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals. we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies.

demand (volume and mix) trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 36.7 percentage points of year-over-year sales growth during 2015. volume/mix growth was driven by the biomet merger, new product introductions and sales in key emerging markets.
we believe long-term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other factors. in addition, demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies.
pricing trends global selling prices had a negative effect of 2.0 percentage points on year-over-year sales during 2015. the negative 2.0 percent effect on year-over-year sales is consistent with what we have experienced over the past three years. the majority of countries in which we operate continued to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems.
foreign currency exchange rates in 2015, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 6.4 percentage points on year-over-year sales. we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk. changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is reduced.

the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased inventory step-up costs as well as increased intangible asset amortization from the biomet merger. the decline was also a result of lower average selling prices and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher hedge gains in 2015 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2014. under the hedging program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings. further, we experienced improved product category and geographic mix, resulting in lower average costs per unit sold as a percentage of sales.
in 2014, we experienced an increase in gross margin percentage compared to 2013, primarily due to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges related to products we
26
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report intend to discontinue. we also recognized higher hedge gains in 2014 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2013.
operating expenses r&d expenses and r&d as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014. the primary driver of the increased expense was the biomet merger. the combination of our r&d functions subsequent to the merger will allow us to allocate a greater portion of the combined r&d spending towards innovation efforts to address unmet clinical needs and create new-market adjacencies. additionally, most of our r&d activities occur in the u.s., so expenses do not decrease proportionally to changes in net sales when there are significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributes to an increase in r&d as a percentage of sales. the increase in 2015 reverses a trend of declines in r&d expense and r&d as a percentage of sales. in prior years, the lower spending reflected a natural decline from certain large projects that achieved commercialization, including persona the personalized knee system, and a dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives. we expect r&d spending in 2016 to increase and be between 4.5 and 5.0 percent of sales.
sg&a as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 after realizing improvements in 2014 and 2013 due to our operational excellence initiatives. the biomet merger was the primary cause of the increase. we expect that sg&a as a percentage of sales will continue to be higher than prior to the biomet merger until we can realize synergy benefits of the merger. additionally, a significant portion of our sg&a expenses occur in the u.s., so expenses do not decrease proportionally to changes in net sales when there are significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
certain claims expense is for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries. we recorded additional expense of $7.7 million in 2015 for durom cup-related claims. since 2008, we have recognized $479.4 million for these claims. for more information regarding these claims, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
special items have increased significantly in the past three years. the increases in 2015 were due to biomet merger-related expenses such as the acceleration of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stock-based awards, retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and third-party sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date, severance expense and contract terminations. special items expense also includes our quality and operational excellence initiatives, which are intended to improve our future operating results by centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality, distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and our information technology systems. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding special items charges.
other expense, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes other expense, net, represents debt issuance costs that we recognized for the bridge credit agreement that we entered into in may 2014 in connection with the biomet merger, the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entitys functional currency offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we enter into to mitigate any gain or loss, and the call premium expense we recognized when we repaid biomets senior notes, partially offset by a gain related to selling certain product line rights and assets. the decrease in other expense, net in 2015 compared to 2014, was driven by fewer months of debt issuance costs from the bridge credit agreement and the gains recognized on the sale of the product line rights and assets.
net interest expense increased in 2015 due to the issuance of the debt in connection with the biomet merger.
our effective tax rate (etr) on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 4.6 percent, 23.4 percent and 22.8 percent, respectively. special items expense has significantly affected our etr as such expenses have generally been incurred within jurisdictions with higher tax rates, resulting in lower taxable income in these higher tax jurisdictions. the low 2015 tax rate results from operating losses in the u.s. caused by significant expenses incurred in connection with the merger. the u.s. has a higher tax rate compared to the majority of foreign operations where we realized operating income. we expect special items, the outcome of various federal, state and foreign audits, as well as expiration of certain statutes of limitations, to impact our etr in future years. currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results.
segment operating profit similar to our consolidated results, our segment operating profit has been significantly impacted by the addition of biomet sales and expenses to these segments. in the americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014, as we started to realize synergies of the merger. in emea, operating profit as a percentage of sales declined in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the increased biomet expenses. this decline is expected to continue until we can realize the synergy benefits of the merger in this region. in the asia pacific segment, operating profit as a percentage of sales increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and our hedging program.
non-gaap operating performance measures we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) to evaluate our operating performance. these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step-up, certain other inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts, certain claims, intangible asset amortization, special items, other expenses related to financing obtained for the biomet merger, other expenses related to the call premium expense recognized to redeem the assumed biomet senior notes, the interest expense incurred on issued debt during the period prior to the consummation of the biomet merger and any related effects on

zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report our income tax provision associated with these items and other certain tax adjustments. we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it provides useful period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating results, it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items, and it provides additional transparency of certain items. certain of these non-gaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs.
our non-gaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $1,310.5 million, $1,098.0 million, and $1,069.0 million, respectively, and our non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were $6.90, $6.40, and $6.22, respectively.
the following are reconciliations from our gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our non-gaap adjusted net earnings and non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes (in millions, except per share amounts).

liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities declined to $816.7 million in 2015, compared to $1,052.8 million in 2014. the decreased cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 were primarily due to higher expenses related to the biomet merger, a $97.6 million loss on our forward starting interest rate swaps we settled in march 2015 when we issued senior notes for the biomet merger and inventory investments. these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower tax payments and the receipt of insurance proceeds related to durom cup product liability claims in the 2015 period. in 2014, we made significant tax payments for certain unresolved matters in order to limit the potential impact of irs interest charges. in 2016, we estimate operating cash flows to be in a range of $1,650.0 million to $1,750.0 million, inclusive of approximately $290.0 million of outflows related to integration expenses to drive synergies.
cash flows used in investing activities were $7,557.9 million in 2015 compared to $469.4 million in 2014. the primary investing activity in 2015 was the biomet merger. we continued to invest in instruments for significant product launches, such as persona the personalized knee system, as we deploy that system around the world. in 2016, we expect instrument investments to be in a range of $300.0 million to $325.0 million in support of our cross-sell initiatives as well as new product introductions. in 2015, we continued to invest in other property, plant and equipment at levels necessary to complete new product-related investments and to replace older machinery and equipment. in 2016, we expect to spend approximately $250.0 million on property, plant and equipment, including $105.0 million necessary to rationalize facilities and it systems as well as to optimize our manufacturing and logistics network.
cash flows provided by financing activities were $7,139.8 million in 2015, compared to a use of cash of $562.4 million in 2014. we issued debt in 2015 for the biomet merger, which resulted in proceeds and related debt issuance costs. we also repaid biomets senior notes that we assumed in the merger. additionally, with an increase in our stock price throughout 2014, many employees exercised stock options in the prior year. accordingly, there were fewer stock options outstanding at the end of 2014, leading to fewer option exercises in 2015 compared to 2014.
in february, may, july and december 2015, our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.22 per share. we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. as further discussed below, our debt facilities restrict the payment of dividends in certain circumstances.
as of december 31, 2015, $449.5 million remained authorized under our $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which has no expiration date. in anticipation of the merger with biomet, we suspended repurchases after the first quarter of 2014. we commenced share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued repurchases in the first two months of 2016.
28
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report through february 25, 2016, we repurchased approximately $415.0 million of shares of our common stock, which includes the $250.0 million of shares that we repurchased from certain selling stockholders on february 10, 2016.
in order to achieve operational synergies, we expect cash outlays related to our integration plans to be approximately $290.0 million in 2016. these cash outlays are necessary to achieve our integration goals of net annual pre-tax operating profit synergies of $350.0 million by the end of the third year post-closing date.
also as discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, as of december 31, 2015, a short-term liability of $50.0 million and long-term liability of $264.6 million related to durom cup product liability claims was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years. we expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability claims from insurance carriers. as of december 31, 2015, we have received a portion of the insurance proceeds we estimate we will recover. we have a long-term receivable of $95.3 million remaining for future expected reimbursements from our insurance carriers. we also had a short-term liability of $33.4 million related to biomet metal-on-metal hip implant claims.
at december 31, 2015, we had ten tranches of senior notes outstanding as follows (dollars in millions):
principal      interest       maturity date rate
$500.0         1.450   %   april 1, 2017

500.0         5.750       november 30, 2039
1,250.0         4.450       august 15, 2045
we issued $7.65 billion of senior notes in march 2015 (the merger notes), the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable in the biomet merger, pay merger related fees and expenses and pay a portion of biomets funded debt. on june 24, 2015, we also borrowed $3.0 billion on a u.s. term loan (u.s. term loan) to fund the biomet merger.
we may, at our option, redeem our senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time upon payment of the principal, any applicable make-whole premium, and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. in addition, the merger notes and the 3.375% senior notes due 2021 may be redeemed at our option without any make-whole premium at specified dates ranging from one month to six months in advance of the scheduled maturity date.
we have a $4.35 billion credit agreement (credit agreement) that contains: (i) a 5-year unsecured u.s. term loan facility (u.s. term loan facility) in the principal amount of $3.0 billion, and (ii) a 5-year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility (multicurrency revolving facility) in the principal amount of $1.35 billion. the multicurrency revolving facility will mature in may 2019, with two one-year extensions available at our option. borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility may be used for general corporate purposes. there were no borrowings outstanding under the multicurrency revolving facility as of december 31, 2015. the u.s. term loan facility will mature in june 2020, with principal payments due beginning september 30, 2015, as follows: $75.0 million on a quarterly basis during the first three years, $112.5 million on a quarterly basis during the fourth year, and $412.5 million on a quarterly basis during the fifth year. in 2015, we paid $500.0 million in principal under the u.s. term loan facility, resulting in $2.5 billion in outstanding borrowings as of december 31, 2015.
we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the credit agreement. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon indices determined by the currency of the borrowings plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an alternate base rate, or, in the case of borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility only, at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 through june 24, 2016 and no greater than 4.5 to 1.0 thereafter. if our credit rating falls below investment grade, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends. we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement as of december 31, 2015.
commitments under the credit agreement are subject to certain fees. on the multicurrency revolving facility, we pay a facility fee at a rate determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating.
we have a japan term loan agreement with one of the lenders under the credit agreement for 11.7 billion japanese yen that will mature on may 31, 2018. borrowings under the japan term loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.61 percent per annum until maturity.
we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $35.8 million.
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. we invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.
as of december 31, 2015, we had short-term and long-term investments in debt securities with a fair value of $273.1 million. these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and, therefore, we believe we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer. all of these debt securities remain highly rated and we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low.
29
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report as of december 31, 2015, $921.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments were held in jurisdictions outside of the u.s. of this amount, $564.7 million is denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk. the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.
in light of our commitments under various credit facilities, as well as our expectation for continued business development, we have plans to repatriate a significant portion of our offshore earnings to the u.s. in particular, as a result of the biomet merger we have unremitted foreign earnings of $4,387.9 million which we plan to repatriate to the u.s. in future periods. we have recorded a long-term liability of $1,494.9 million for the estimated tax impact of this repatriation.
management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs, as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. should additional investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments. the following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions):
contractual                              total            2016          2017          2019              2021

total contractual obligations        $16,423.5          $460.8      $3,152.9      $4,678.1          $8,131.7
$93.5 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2015 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans. defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions. due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2016. therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.
also included in other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon. due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made. therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits. we have also excluded long-term deferred tax liabilities from this table, as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r&d milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product. since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table. these payments could range from $0 to $45 million.
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below.
excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value. to determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work -in-process inventory, which is recorded at cost. obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis.
income taxes  our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized. federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the u.s.
30
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2015 form 10-k annual report the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards (fasb) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
commitments and contingencies  accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.
in addition to our general product liability, we have recorded provisions totaling $479.4 million related to the durom cup, including $7.7 million in 2015. see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup litigation.
goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. as such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs. changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.
we have seven reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. two of these reporting units, cmf and bone healing, consist entirely of assets and liabilities acquired in the biomet merger. since these assets and liabilities were valued at their estimated fair value on the closing date, in our 2015 impairment test, the carrying value approximated the fair value. therefore, if these reporting units perform below what we expected at the time that we estimated their fair value, we may be required to record impairment charges.
our other five reporting units consist of combined zimmer and biomet assets and liabilities. in our 2015 impairment test, our emea reporting units estimated fair value only exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by 8 percent, or approximately $240 million. this reporting units estimated fair value has significantly decreased from prior year impairment tests due to the weakening of the euro against the u.s. dollar. for our other four reporting units, their estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20 percent.
share-based payment  we measure share-based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. additionally, we must estimate the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock. the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent managements best estimates.

item 1a.    risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. these risks are not the only risks we face. our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. we can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts, although we believe they are reasonable, will be successful.
economic conditions and other economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business by negatively impacting our customers' disposable income or discretionary spending, increasing our costs of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses, and adversely affecting our sales or profitability.
we believe many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and generally have limited discretionary spending dollars. any factor that could adversely affect that disposable income would decrease our customers' spending and could cause our customers to shift their spending to products other than those sold by us or to our less profitable product choices, all of which could result in lower net sales, decreases in inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, a change in the mix of products we sell, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins. factors that could reduce our customers' disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to adverse economic conditions such as increased or sustained high unemployment or underemployment levels, inflation, increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates, lack of available credit, consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, concerns over government mandated participation in health insurance programs and increasing healthcare costs, and decreases in government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs.
many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income, as well as commodity rates, transportation costs (including the costs of diesel fuel), costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, lease costs, measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors, also affect our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative expenses, and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control, all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability. we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors.
our plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and improve the efficiencies, costs and effectiveness of our operations, and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely.
we have strategies and initiatives (such as those relating to merchandising, sourcing, shrink, private brand, distribution and transportation, store operations, store formats, budgeting and expense reduction, and real estate) in various stages of testing, evaluation, and implementation, upon which we expect to rely to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition and to achieve our financial plans. these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain, even when tested successfully, in their application to our business in general. it is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation, particularly in light of the diverse geographic locations of our stores and the decentralized nature of our field management. general implementation also may be negatively affected by other risk factors described herein. successful systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training, stability of workforce, ease of execution, and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely. failure to achieve
7
successful implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management's estimates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
the success of our merchandising initiatives, particularly those with respect to non-consumable merchandise and store-specific products and allocations, depends in part upon our ability to predict consistently and successfully the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences, expectations and needs. if we are unable to select products that are attractive to customers, to timely obtain such products at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit, or to effectively market such products, our sales, market share and profitability could be adversely affected. if our merchandising efforts in the non-consumables area or the higher margin areas within consumables are unsuccessful, we could be further adversely affected by our inability to offset the lower margins associated with our consumables business. further, our merchandising efforts in the consumables area, including tobacco products, may not generate the net sales growth and increase customer traffic to the levels needed to offset the lower margins generated by sales of consumables and maintain our targeted gross profit margins.
if we cannot open, relocate or remodel stores profitably and on schedule, our planned future growth will be impeded, which would adversely affect sales.
our ability to open, relocate and remodel profitable stores is a key component of our planned future growth. our ability to timely open stores and to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors: the availability of attractive store locations; the absence of entitlement process or occupancy delays; the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms; the ability to hire and train new personnel, especially store managers, in a cost effective manner; the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas; general economic conditions; and the availability of capital funding for expansion. many of these factors also affect our ability to successfully relocate stores, and many of them are beyond our control.
delays or failures in opening new stores or completing relocations or remodels, or achieving lower than expected sales in these projects, could materially adversely affect our growth and/or profitability. we also may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and, as a result, may not meet our targets for opening new stores, remodeling or relocating stores or expanding profitably.
some new stores and future new store opportunities may be located in areas, including but not limited to new states or metro urban areas, where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition. those areas may have different competitive and market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, as well as higher cost of entry. these factors may cause our new stores to be initially less successful than stores in our existing markets, which could slow future growth in these areas.
many new stores will be located in areas where we have existing stores. although we have experience in these areas, increasing the number of locations in these markets may result in inadvertent oversaturation and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores, thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance.
our profitability may be negatively affected by inventory shrinkage.
we are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. we experience significant inventory shrinkage and cannot be sure that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft, our results of operations and financial condition could be affected adversely.
8
we face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance.
the retail business is highly competitive with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, in-stock consistency, customer service, aggressive promotional activity, customers, and employees. we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers, including mass merchandise, warehouse club, grocery, drug, convenience, variety and other specialty stores. this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices, and thus the lower margins, that may be required to maintain our competitive position. also, companies like ours, due to customer demographics and other factors, may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs without losing competitive position. this limitation may adversely affect our margins and financial performance. certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we can. if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets, it could adversely affect our financial performance.
competition for customers has intensified as competitors have moved into, or increased their presence in, our geographic markets and from the use of mobile and web-based technology that facilitates online shopping and real-time product and price comparisons. we expect this competition to continue to increase. we remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into our industry in a significant way, including through the introduction of new store formats. further, consolidation within the discount retail industry could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace. this consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions, as well as result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by these consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
our private brands may not maintain broad market acceptance and may increase the risks we face.
the sale of private brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans. we have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts relating to these private brand offerings. we believe that our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors, including pricing, our costs, quality and customer perception. we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands. the sale and expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to certain risks, such as: potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and legal and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
a significant disruption to our distribution network, to the capacity of our distribution centers or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.
we rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner. using various modes of transportation, including ocean, rail, and truck, we and our vendors move goods from vendor locations to our distribution centers. deliveries to our stores occur from our distribution centers or directly from our vendors. any disruption, unanticipated or
9
unusual expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively. for example, delivery delays or increases in transportation costs (including through increased fuel costs, increased carrier rates or driver wages as a result of driver shortages, a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments, or work stoppages or slowdowns) could significantly decrease our ability to make sales and earn profits. labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries or which would necessitate our securing alternative labor or shipping suppliers could also increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business.
we maintain a network of distribution facilities and are moving forward with plans to build new facilities to support our growth objectives. delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future financial performance by slowing store growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth, or by increasing transportation costs. in addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks that could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials or skilled labor; work stoppages; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases. the completion date and ultimate cost of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons. we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets.
risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance.
the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, and we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. in 2015, our largest and second largest suppliers each accounted for 7% of our purchases. we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that, if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business. however, such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs, result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels, and reduce the quality of our merchandise, and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales. additionally, if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and damage to our reputation.
we directly imported approximately 6% of our purchases (measured at cost) in 2015, but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products. changes to the prices and flow of these goods for any reason, such as political unrest or acts of war, currency fluctuations, disruptions in maritime lanes, port labor disputes, and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our standards, issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience (such as strikes, stoppages or slowdowns, which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption), the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers, increased import duties, merchandise quality or safety issues, transport availability and cost, increases in wage rates and taxes, transport security, inflation, and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import, are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability. while we are working to reduce our dependency on goods produced in china, a substantial amount of our imported merchandise still comes from china, and thus, a change in the chinese leadership, economic and market conditions, internal economic stimulus actions, or currency or other policies, as well as increases in costs of labor and wage taxes, could negatively impact our merchandise costs. in addition, the united states' foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and
10
other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control. these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance. as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors, the risks associated with these imports also will increase, and we may be exposed to additional or different risks as we increase imports of goods produced in countries other than china.
product liability and food safety claims could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial performance.
despite our best efforts to ensure the quality, safety and freshness of the products that we sell in all of our stores, we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or actions required or penalties assessed by government agencies relating to products, including but not limited to food products that are recalled, defective or otherwise alleged to be harmful. such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling and transportation phases.
all of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and food safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety standards. we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers. if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers' lack of understanding of u.s. product liability or other laws, which may result in our having to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer. even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. our litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.
we are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements. a significant change in, or noncompliance with, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.
our business is subject to numerous and increasing federal, state and local laws and regulations. we routinely incur significant costs in complying with these regulations. the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are increasing due to expanding and additional legal and regulatory requirements and increased enforcement efforts. new laws or regulations, particularly those dealing with environmental compliance, product safety, food safety, information security and privacy, and labor and employment, among others, or changes in existing laws and regulations, particularly those governing the sale of products or employee wages, may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our cost of doing business. untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall, can result in the imposition of penalties, including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties, class action litigation or other litigation, in addition to reputational damage. additionally, changes in tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate.
litigation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. nationally, the number of employment-related class
11
actions filed each year has continued to increase, and recent changes and proposed changes in federal and state laws, regulations and agency guidance may cause claims to rise even more. the outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is difficult to assess or quantify. plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. in addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required. the cost to defend future litigation may be significant. there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. as a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding certain of these pending matters.
natural disasters (whether or not caused by climate change), unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, and global political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.
the occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes and earthquakes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located, or similar disruptions could adversely affect our business and financial performance. uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns, which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short-term results of operations. to the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers, a significant number of stores, or our corporate headquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers, our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales. in addition, these events could result in increases in fuel (or other energy) prices or a fuel shortage, delays in opening new stores, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some domestic and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores, the inability of customers to reach or have transportation to our stores directly affected by such events, the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption of our utility services or to our information systems. these events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.
material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors, staffing shortages or challenges or difficulties in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
we depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business and are continually improving our information processes and computer systems to better run our business. these technology initiatives may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule. additionally, such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cybersecurity breaches, natural disasters and human error. damage or interruption to these systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim, may experience loss or corruption of critical data and may receive negative publicity, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
12
we also rely heavily on our information technology staff. failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems. we rely on certain vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business. the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner. in addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.
failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, as well as other labor issues, could adversely affect our financial performance.
our future growth and performance and positive customer experience depends on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified employees, many of whom are in positions with historically high rates of turnover. our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling our labor costs, is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs, changes in employment and labor laws (including changes in the process for our employees to join a union) or other workplace regulations (including changes in "entitlement" programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs), and our reputation and relevance within the labor market. if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees, our operations, customer service levels and support functions could suffer. to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our labor costs could increase. in addition, anticipated regulatory changes relating to the overtime exemptions under the fair labor standards act could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. our ability to pass along labor costs to our customers is constrained by our everyday low price model, and we may not be able to offset the costs elsewhere in our business.
our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel. if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. the unexpected loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have an adverse effect on our operations. there can be no assurance that our executive succession planning, retention or hiring efforts will be successful. competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations. we do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or key personnel.
our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances.
our inventory balance represented approximately 54% of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of january 29, 2016. efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. to be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers' demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or that subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage. if our buying decisions do not accurately
13
predict customer trends, we inappropriately price products or our expectations about customer spending levels are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. we continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our inventory management. if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected.
because our business is seasonal to a certain extent, with the highest volume of net sales during the fourth quarter, adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole.
we generally recognize our highest volume of net sales during the christmas selling season, which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. in anticipation of this holiday, we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory. adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, high unemployment, high gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unusual or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lower-than-planned sales during the holiday season. an excess of seasonal merchandise inventory could result if our net sales during the christmas selling season fall below seasonal norms or expectations. if our fourth quarter sales results were substantially below expectations, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns, especially in seasonal merchandise.
our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance.
our insurance coverage reflects deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations. however, there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, employee and certain other crime, certain wage and hour and other employment-related claims, including class actions, and some natural disasters. if we incur these losses and they are material, our business could suffer. certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. to offset negative insurance market trends, we may elect to self-insure, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes. in addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers' compensation, automobile liability, general liability and group health insurance programs. unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers, we are effectively self-insured for other property losses. if we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
any failure to maintain the security of information we hold relating to our customers, employees and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures, and could materially disrupt our operations and harm our reputation and sales.
in connection with sales, we transmit confidential credit and debit card information. we also have access to, collect or maintain certain private or confidential information regarding our customers, employees and vendors, as well as our business. additionally, under certain circumstances, we may
14
share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business (for example, third-party vendors assist us in the transmittal of credit and debit card information in connection with sales), as required by law, or with the permission of the individual. while we have implemented procedures and technology intended to protect and safeguard our information and require appropriate controls of our vendors, it is possible that computer hackers and others might compromise our security measures or those of our technology and other vendors in the future and obtain the personal information of our customers, employees and vendors that we hold or our business information, as cyberattacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. moreover, employee error or malfeasance or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party vendors' security measures and breach our or our third-party vendors' information systems.
because we accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the payment card industry data security standards ("pci dss"), issued by the payment card industry security standards council. pci dss contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing, and transmission of cardholder data. additionally, we have implemented technology in all of our stores to allow for the acceptance of europay, mastercard and visa (emv) credit transactions. complying with pci dss standards and implementing related procedures, technology and information security measures require significant resources and ongoing attention. however, even as we comply with pci dss standards and offer emv technology in our stores, we may be vulnerable to, and unable to detect and appropriately respond to, data security breaches and data loss, including cybersecurity attacks or other breach of cardholder data.
a security breach of any kind (whether experienced by us or one of our vendors), which could be undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with the applicable privacy and information security laws, regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement actions, fines or penalties, and costly response measures (including, for example, providing notification to, and credit monitoring services for, affected customers, as well as further upgrades to our security measures) which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies, and could materially disrupt our operations. any resulting negative media attention and publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
deterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.
we rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations, growth strategy, and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and our credit ratings. our debt securities currently have an investment grade rating, and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. as a result, any disruptions or turmoil in the debt markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and our ability to return cash to our shareholders. there can be no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt markets will not be adversely impacted by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings.
15
new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance.
the implementation of new accounting standards will require extensive systems, internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs, and also will result in changes to our financial statements. in particular, the implementation of accounting standards related to leases, as recently issued by the financial accounting standards board are expected to require us to make significant changes to our lease management, fixed asset, and other accounting systems, and will result in significant changes to our financial statements.
u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. the outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. it also should be read in conjunction with the cautionary disclosure regarding forward-looking statements and the risk factors disclosures set forth in the introduction and in item 1a of this report, respectively.
executive overview we are among the largest discount retailers in the united states by number of stores, with 12,575 stores located in 43 states as of february 26, 2016, with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, midwestern and eastern united states. we offer a broad selection of merchandise, including consumable products such as food, paper and cleaning products, health and beauty products and pet supplies, and non-consumable products such as seasonal merchandise, home decor and domestics, and basic apparel. our merchandise includes high-quality national brands from leading manufacturers, as well as comparable quality and value private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands. we offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices (typically $10 or less) in our convenient small-box locations, with selling space averaging approximately 7,400 square feet per store.
because the customers we serve are value-conscious, many with low or fixed incomes, we have always been intensely focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars. we believe our convenient store format and broad selection of high-quality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years. like other retailers, we have been operating for several years in an environment with ongoing macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties. our core customers are often the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions such as unemployment and fluctuating food, energy and medical costs, and the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions. our customer has experienced both positive and negative general economic factors during 2015, such as lower gasoline prices and unemployment rates coupled with rising rents and medical costs. the overall financial impact of these factors to our customers has been inconsistent and their duration is unknown.
our operating priorities continue to evolve as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customer-centric focus. we are keenly focused on executing the following priorities: 1) driving profitable sales growth, 2) capturing growth opportunities, 3) enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4) investing in our people as a competitive advantage.
we seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives such as improvement in our in-stock position, as well as an ongoing focus on enhancing our margins while maintaining both everyday low price and affordability.
 our in-stock improvement initiative is designed to ensure the right products are available on the shelf when our customers shop in our stores. to support this initiative and improve overall customer satisfaction, we are selectively investing incremental labor hours in those stores where we believe such increases will generate positive financial returns. as of the end of 2015, this retail labor hour investment had been implemented across over 3,100 stores. we have a disciplined approach to this labor investment and are able to quickly evaluate whether it delivers on our profitability expectations, reallocating resources as necessary.
 we demonstrate our commitment to the affordability needs of our core customer by pricing more than 75% of our stock-keeping units at
$5 or less as of the end of 2015. however, as we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers' affordability needs, we also remain focused on enhancing our margins through effective category management, inventory shrink reduction initiatives, private brands penetration, efforts to improve distribution and
24
transportation efficiencies, global sourcing, and pricing and markdown optimization. with respect to category management, the mix of sales affects profitability because the gross margin associated with sales within our consumables category generally is lower than that associated with sales within our non-consumables categories. even within each category, however, there are varying levels of gross margin associated with the specific items. with respect to inventory shrink reduction, the progress in 2015 was broad-based with shrink declining across all four product categories. for a discussion of the sales mix, as well as the results of certain other margin-related initiatives in 2015, see "results of operations" below.
the degree of success of these initiatives is often reflected in our same-store sales results and in the level of improvement in shopper frequency and number of items sold and average transaction amount. for the 2015 fourth quarter, we believe these ongoing initiatives helped to drive the same-store sales growth in three out of our four product categories, reflecting increases in both customer traffic and average transaction amount for the 32nd consecutive quarter when compared to the prior year quarter.
to support our other operating priorities we also are focused on capturing growth opportunities and innovating within our channel. we continued to expand our store count, opening 730 stores during 2015. we also have continued our store remodeling efforts and remodeled or relocated a total of 881 stores during 2015. in fiscal 2016, we have plans to open 900 stores and to relocate or remodel 875 stores, and we plan to maintain our accelerated square footage growth of approximately six to eight percent during 2017. we continue to innovate within our channel, and during 2016 we will implement the dg16 store format. this store format will include additional cooler doors, a redesigned queueing area, and other enhancements that are focused on meeting the evolving demands of our core customer while also delivering on our operating priorities. in addition, we are testing a smaller format store (less than 6,000 square feet) which we believe could allow us to capture growth opportunities in metropolitan areas.
we have established a position as a low-cost operator, continuously seeking ways to control costs that do not affect our customer's shopping experience. we have enhanced this position during the latter part of 2015 and into 2016 through our zero-based budgeting initiative, streamlining our business while also reducing expenses. our goal is to lower the same-store sales growth required to leverage selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses. as part of this initiative we reduced approximately 255 positions within our corporate support function in the third quarter of 2015 and expect to reinvest a portion of these savings in the business as we deem appropriate. in addition, at the store level, we remain committed to simplifying or eliminating various tasks so that those time savings can be reinvested by our store managers in other areas such as ensuring customer service, improved in-stock levels, and improved store standards. we will continue to seek additional opportunities to enhance our low-cost position.
our employees are a competitive advantage, and we are always searching for ways to continue investing in them. our training programs are continually evolving, as we work to ensure that our employees have the tools necessary to be successful in their positions. we invest in our employees in an effort to create an environment that attracts and retains talented personnel, as we believe that, particularly at the store level, employees who are promoted from within generally have longer tenures and are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance. furthermore, we believe that reducing our store manager turnover likely results in improved store financial performance in areas such as shrink and sales. we have also implemented training programs for high-potential employees, and believe that these and other efforts will produce a more stable, engaged workforce.
our continued focus on these four operating priorities, coupled with strong cash flow management and share repurchases resulted in solid overall operating and financial performance in 2015 as compared to 2014 as follows. basis points, as referred to below, are equal to 0.01 percent of net sales.
 net sales in 2015 increased 7.7% over 2014. sales in same-stores increased 2.8%, with increases in both customer traffic and average transaction amount. consumables represented 76% of sales
25
in
2015. departments with the most significant increases in net sales were candy and snacks, perishables, tobacco, and food. average sales per square foot in 2015 were $226, up from $223 in 2014.
 operating profit increased 9.7% to $1.94 billion, or 9.5% of sales, compared to $1.77 billion, or 9.4% of sales in 2014.
the increase in our operating profit rate was attributable to a 27 basis-point increase in our gross profit rate, which was partially offset by a 10 basis-point increase in sg&a.
 our gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points due primarily to lower transportation costs and a lower rate of inventory shrinkage.
 the increase in sg&a, as a percentage of sales, was due primarily to increases in incentive compensation expense, repairs and maintenance expense and occupancy costs. for other factors, see the detailed discussion that follows.
 interest expense decreased by $1.3 million in 2015 to $86.9 million. total long-term obligations as of january 29, 2016 were $2.97 billion.
 we reported net income of $1.17 billion, or $3.95 per diluted share, for 2015, compared to net income of $1.07 billion, or $3.49 per diluted share, for 2014. stock repurchase activity during 2014 and 2015 contributed to the increase in diluted earnings per share.
 we generated approximately $1.38 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2015, an increase of 4.8% compared to 2014.
we primarily utilized our cash flows from operating activities to invest in the growth of our business, repurchase our common stock, and pay quarterly cash dividends.
 inventory turnover was 4.7 times on a rolling four-quarter basis. inventories increased 4.3% on a per store basis over 2014.
 during 2015 we opened 730 new stores, remodeled or relocated 881 stores, and closed 36 stores.
also in 2015, we repurchased approximately 17.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $1.3 billion.
in 2016, we plan to continue to focus on our four key operating priorities. we expect our sales growth in 2016 to again be driven primarily by consumables, although we expect non-consumables sales to continue to contribute to our profitable sales growth. same-store sales growth is key to achieving our objectives, and we have implemented targeted actions to drive same-store sales in 2016, such as updating our customer segmentation to gain deeper insights into the spending habits for each of our core customer segments. this helps drive our category management process, as we optimize our assortment and expand into those categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. our continued focus on on-shelf availability and affordability also should assist in growing transactions and number of items sold. our new store format will offer a total of 22 cooler doors, an increase of six cooler doors as compared to our previous new store format and will be utilized for all new stores, relocations and remodels.
other key 2016 initiatives include our zero-based budgeting initiative, which we expect to take costs out of the business that do not affect the customer experience, ongoing supply chain improvements, and investing in our people. in addition, we plan to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock and pay quarterly cash dividends, subject to board discretion, to further enhance shareholder return. however, we are facing potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions under the fair labor standards act, which, if implemented, are expected to increase our labor costs and negatively affect our operating results.

results of operations accounting periods.    the following text contains references to years 2015, 2014, and 2013, which represent fiscal years ended january 29, 2016, january 30, 2015, and january 31, 2014, respectively. our fiscal year ends on the friday closest to january 31. all referenced fiscal years were 52-week accounting periods.
seasonality.    the nature of our business is seasonal to a certain extent. primarily because of sales of holiday-related merchandise, sales in our fourth quarter (november, december and january) have historically been higher than sales achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. expenses, and to a greater extent operating profit, vary by quarter. results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year. furthermore, the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods. for more information about the seasonality of our business, see "seasonality" included in part 1, item 1 of this report.

net sales.    the net sales increase in 2015 reflects a same-store sales increase of 2.8% compared to 2014. for 2015, there were 11,706 same-stores which accounted for sales of $19.25 billion. same-stores include stores that have been open for at least 13 months and remain open at the end of the reporting period. changes in same-store sales are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the
27
prior year, and include stores that have been remodeled, expanded or relocated. the remainder of the increase in sales in 2015 was attributable to new stores, partially offset by sales from closed stores. the increase in sales reflects increased customer traffic and average transaction amounts. increases in sales of consumables slightly outpaced our non-consumables, with sales of candy and snacks, perishables, tobacco products, and food contributing the majority of the increase in sales of consumables.
the net sales increase in 2014 reflects a same-store sales increase of 2.8% compared to 2013. for 2014, there were 11,052 same-stores which accounted for sales of $17.82 billion. the remainder of the increase in sales in 2014 was attributable to new stores, partially offset by sales from closed stores. the increase in sales reflects increased customer traffic and average transaction amounts resulting from the refinement of the company's merchandise offerings, including a full year's sales of tobacco products, the expansion of perishables, and enhanced utilization of store square footage. increases in sales of consumables outpaced our non-consumables, with sales of tobacco products, perishables, and candy and snacks contributing the majority of the increase in sales of consumables.
of our four major merchandise categories, the consumables category, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories, has grown most significantly over the past several years. because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit, we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate.
gross profit.    the gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 31.0% in 2015 compared to 30.7% in 2014. gross profit increased by 8.7% in 2015, and as a percentage of sales, increased by 27 basis points. the gross profit rate increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflects lower transportation costs and an improved rate of inventory shrinkage, partially offset by increased markdowns. we recorded a lifo benefit of $2.3 million in 2015 compared to a lifo provision of $4.2 million in 2014.
the gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 30.7% in 2014 compared to 31.1% in 2013. gross profit increased by 6.7% in 2014, and as a percentage of sales, decreased by 36 basis points. the most significant factor affecting the gross profit rate was an increase in markdowns, primarily due to increased promotions driven by competitive pressures. in addition, we experienced a continued trend of consumables comprising a larger portion of our net sales, primarily as the result of increased sales of lower margin consumables including tobacco products and expanded perishables offerings. these factors were partially offset by higher initial inventory markups. we recorded a lifo provision of $4.2 million in 2014 compared to a lifo benefit of $11.0 million in 2013.
sg&a.    sg&a was 21.4% as a percentage of sales in 2015 compared to 21.3% in 2014, an increase of 10 basis points. the 2015 results reflect increases in incentive compensation expenses, repairs and maintenance expenses, occupancy costs, and fees associated with an increase in debit card transactions. partially offsetting these items was a higher volume of cash back transactions resulting in increased convenience fees collected from customers. the 2014 results reflect expenses of $14.3 million, or 8 basis points as a percentage of sales, related to an acquisition that was not completed.
sg&a expense was 21.3% as a percentage of sales in 2014 compared to 21.1% in 2013, an increase of 19 basis points. the 2014 results reflect a significant increase in incentive compensation expense, as our 2013 financial performance did not satisfy certain performance requirements under our cash incentive compensation program. the 2014 results also reflect increases in rent and utilities. partially offsetting these increased costs were retail labor expense, which increased at a rate lower than our increase in sales, the introduction of convenience fees charged to customers for cash back on debit card transactions, and a reduction in workers' compensation and general liability expenses. the 2014 period included expenses of $14.3 million relating to an acquisition that was not completed, while the 2013 results include expenses of $8.5 million for a legal settlement of a previously decertified collective action.
28
interest expense.    interest expense decreased $1.3 million to $86.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014. see the detailed discussion under "liquidity and capital resources" regarding the financing of various long-term obligations.
interest expense remained relatively constant in 2014 compared to 2013.
we had outstanding variable-rate debt of $686.6 million and $62.0 million as of january 29, 2016 and january 30, 2015, respectively, after taking into consideration the impact of interest rate swaps in effect at january 30, 2015. the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at january 29, 2016 and january 30, 2015 was fixed rate debt.
other (income) expense.    in 2015, we recorded pretax losses of $0.3 million related to the refinancing of long-term debt. in 2013, we recorded pretax losses of $18.9 million resulting from the termination of our senior secured credit facilities.
income taxes.    the effective income tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were expenses of 37.1%, 36.6% and 37.0%, respectively.
the effective income tax rate for 2015 was 37.1% compared to a rate of 36.6% for 2014 which represents a net increase of 0.5 percentage points. the effective income tax rate was lower in 2014 due principally to federal and state reserve releases in 2014 that did not reoccur, to the same extent, in 2015. as in prior years, we receive a significant income tax benefit related to wages paid to certain newly hired employees that qualify for federal jobs credits (principally the work opportunity tax credit or "wotc"). in december 2015, congress retroactively extended the federal law authorizing the wotc for the period from january 1, 2015 through december 31, 2019. accordingly, based on current law, the wotc should be available for our 2016 through 2019 fiscal years.
the effective income tax rate for 2014 was 36.6% compared to a rate of 37.0% for 2013 which represents a net decrease of 0.4 percentage points. the effective income tax rate decreased from 2013 due principally to the favorable resolution of state income tax examinations and other state income tax reserves, which increased by a lesser amount in 2014 compared to 2013.
off balance sheet arrangements the entities involved in the ownership structure underlying the leases for three of our distribution centers meet the accounting definition of a variable interest entity ("vie"). one of these distribution centers has been recorded as a financing obligation whereby its property and equipment are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. the land and buildings of the other two distribution centers have been recorded as operating leases. we are not the primary beneficiary of these vies and, accordingly, have not included these entities in our consolidated financial statements. other than the foregoing, we are not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements.
effects of inflation we experienced little or no overall product cost inflation in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
liquidity and capital resources current financial condition and recent developments during the past three years, we have generated an aggregate of approximately $3.91 billion in cash flows from operating activities and incurred approximately $1.42 billion in capital expenditures. during that period, we expanded the number of stores we operate by 1,977, representing growth of approximately 19%, and we remodeled or relocated 2,378 stores, or approximately 19% of the stores we operated as of january 29, 2016. we intend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth, remodels and relocations in 2016.

we have a five-year $1.425 billion unsecured credit agreement (the "facilities"), and we have outstanding $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. at january 29, 2016, we had total outstanding debt (including the current portion of long-term obligations) of $2.97 billion, which includes balances under the facilities, and senior notes, all of which are described in greater detail below. we had $722.0 million available for borrowing under the facilities at january 29, 2016. the information contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements under the heading "borrowing facilities and 2015 refinancing" contained in part ii, item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference. cash and cash equivalents decreased by $421.9 million in 2015, primarily due to the suspension of share repurchases during the portion of 2014 that coincided with our attempted acquisition, resulting in higher than normal cash and cash equivalents balances at the end of 2014.
we believe our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances, combined with availability under the facilities as discussed in greater detail below and access to the debt markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several years. however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control. depending on our liquidity levels, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity or other securities, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations.
facilities on october 20, 2015, we consummated a refinancing pursuant to which we amended and restated our senior unsecured credit facilities. the facilities consist of a $425.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the "term facility") and a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "revolving facility") which provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $175.0 million. the facilities are scheduled to mature on october 20, 2020.
borrowings under the facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus, at our option, either (a) libor or (b) a base rate (which is usually equal to the prime rate). the applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of january 29, 2016 was 1.10% for libor borrowings and 0.10% for base-rate borrowings. we must also pay a facility fee, payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the facilities, and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the revolving facility. the applicable interest rate margins for borrowings, the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the facilities are subject to adjustment from time to time based on our long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. the weighted average all-in interest rate for borrowings under the facilities was 1.65% as of january 29, 2016.
the facilities can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty. there is no required amortization under the facilities. the facilities contain a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the company's and its subsidiaries ability to: incur additional liens; sell all or substantially all of our assets; consummate certain fundamental changes or change in the company's lines of business; and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness. the facilities also contain financial covenants that require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. as of january 29, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants. the facilities also contain customary events of default.
as of january 29, 2016, under the revolving facility, the company had outstanding borrowings of $251.0 million, standby letters of credit of $27.0 million, and borrowing availability of $722.0 million. in addition, we had outstanding commercial letters of credit of $11.7 million.
30
for the remainder of fiscal 2016, we anticipate potential borrowings under the revolving facility up to a maximum of approximately $500 million outstanding at any one time, including any anticipated borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock.
senior notes on october 20, 2015, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.150% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 senior notes"), net of discount of $0.8 million, which are scheduled to mature on november 1, 2025. in addition, we have $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2017 (the "2017 senior notes") which are scheduled to mature on july 15, 2017, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% senior notes due 2018 (the "2018 senior notes"), net of discount of $0.2 million, which are scheduled to mature on april 15, 2018; and $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 senior notes"), net of discount of $1.8 million, which are scheduled to mature on april 15, 2023. collectively, the 2017 senior notes, the 2018 senior notes, the 2023 senior notes and the 2025 senior notes comprise the "senior notes", each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of senior notes (as so supplemented and amended, the "senior indenture"). interest on the 2017 senior notes is payable in cash on january 15 and july 15 of each year. interest on the 2018 senior notes and the 2023 senior notes is payable in cash on april 15 and october 15 of each year. interest on the 2025 senior notes is payable in cash on may 1 and november 1 of each year, commencing on may 1, 2016. the net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 senior notes were used, together with borrowings under the facilities, to repay all outstanding borrowings under the then-existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes.
we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the senior indenture. upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which is defined in the senior indenture, each holder of our senior notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder's senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
the senior indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, our ability (subject to certain exceptions) to consolidate, merge, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries.
the senior indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on our senior notes to become or to be declared due and payable, as applicable.
sale leaseback transaction in january 2014 we consummated a transaction pursuant to which we sold and subsequently leased back the land, buildings and related improvements for 233 of our stores. this transaction resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $281.6 million.
rating agencies in october 2015, standard & poor's raised our senior unsecured debt rating and our corporate debt rating to bbb, both with a stable outlook, and moody's reaffirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of baa3 and changed our outlook to positive. our current credit ratings, as well as future rating agency actions, could (i) impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms; (ii) affect our financing costs; and (iii) affect our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our self-insured programs. there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings.
31
interest rate swaps from time to time, we use interest rate swaps to minimize the risk of adverse changes in interest rates. these swaps are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. because of high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure. our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our facilities. on may 31, 2015, interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $875.0 million expired, and at january 29, 2016, we had no outstanding interest rate swaps. for more information see item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" below.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january 29, 2016 (in thousands):

long-term debt obligations           $2,986,590              $215                  $900,770                         $677,080       $1,408,525

(a)
represents obligations for interest payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations, and includes projected interest on variable rate long-term debt, using 2015 year end rates and balances. variable rate long-term debt includes the balance of the senior revolving credit facility (which had a balance of $251 million as of january 29, 2016), the balance of our tax increment financing of $10.6 million, and the balance of the senior term loan facility of $425 million.
(b)
we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers' compensation, employee health insurance, general liability, property loss and automobile insurance. as these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, these amounts represent undiscounted estimates based upon actuarial assumptions. reserves for workers' compensation and general liability which existed as of the date of a merger transaction in 2007 were discounted in order to arrive at estimated fair value. all other amounts are reflected on an undiscounted basis in our consolidated balance sheets.
(c)
operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts included in deferred rent in our consolidated balance sheets.
32
(d)
commercial commitments include information technology license and support agreements, supplies, fixtures, letters of credit for import merchandise, and other inventory purchase obligations.
(e)
purchase obligations include legally binding agreements for software licenses and support, supplies, fixtures, and merchandise purchases (excluding such purchases subject to letters of credit).
(f)
we have potential payment obligations associated with uncertain tax positions that are not reflected in these totals. we are currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the taxing authorities for the $8.7 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions.
share repurchase program on december 2, 2015, the company's board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to our existing common stock repurchase program. our common stock repurchase program had a total remaining authorization of approximately $924 million at january 29, 2016. under the authorization, purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market and other conditions, and the authorization has no expiration date. for more detail about our share repurchase program, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
other considerations on march 8, 2016, the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.25 per share which will be paid on april 12, 2016 to shareholders of record on march 29, 2016, an increase of $0.03 per share over quarterly dividends paid in 2015. although the board currently intends to continue regular quarterly cash dividends, the payment of future cash dividends are subject to the board's discretion and will depend upon, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant.
our inventory balance represented approximately 54% of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets as of january 29, 2016. our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year. inventory purchases are often somewhat seasonal in nature, such as the purchase of warm-weather or christmas-related merchandise. efficient management of our inventory has been and continues to be an area of focus for us.
as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims, some of which could potentially result in material cash payments. adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity. we also have certain income tax-related contingencies as disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.
cash flows cash flows from operating activities.    cash flows from operating activities were $1.38 billion in 2015, an increase of $63.2 million compared to 2014. significant components of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 include increased net income due primarily to increased sales and operating profit in 2015 as described in more detail above under "results of operations." changes in merchandise inventories resulted in a net use of working capital, increasing by a greater amount in 2015 compared to 2014 as described in greater detail below. accounts payable increased by $105.6 million in 2015 compared to a $97.2 million increase in 2014, due primarily to the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments.
33
cash flows from operating activities were $1.31 billion in 2014, an increase of $101.7 million compared to 2013. significant components of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 include increased net income due primarily to increased sales and operating profit in 2014 as described in more detail above under "results of operations." merchandise inventories increased by a greater amount in 2014 compared to 2013 as described in greater detail below, which was partially offset by accounts payable, which increased by $97.2 million in 2014 compared to a $36.9 million increase in 2013. the increase in accounts payable during 2014 was due primarily to the volume and timing of domestic merchandise receipts.
on an ongoing basis, we closely monitor and manage our inventory balances, and they may fluctuate from period to period based on new store openings, the timing of purchases, and other factors. inventory balances at january 29, 2016 were impacted by a new dc in texas, the timing of the easter holiday in 2016, and our in-stock improvement initiative. merchandise inventories increased by 10% in 2015, by 9% in 2014, and by 7% in 2013. inventory levels in the consumables category increased by $218.4 million, or 13% in 2015, by $178.4 million, or 12%, in 2014, and by $168.0 million, or 12%, in 2013. the seasonal category increased by $63.2 million, or 13%, in 2015, by $13.8 million, or 3%, in 2014, and decreased by $4.7 million, or 1%, in 2013. the home products category increased by $12.8 million, or 5%, in 2015, was essentially unchanged in 2014, and increased by $22.0 million, or 9%, in 2013. the apparel category decreased by $2.7 million, or 1%, in 2015, increased by $37.1 million, or 13%, in 2014, and decreased by $29.5 million, or 9%, in 2013.
cash flows from investing activities.    significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2015 included the following approximate amounts: $168 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $144 million for distribution and transportation-related projects; $99 million for new leased stores; $53 million for stores built by us; and $34 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. the timing of new, remodeled and relocated store openings along with other factors may affect the relationship between such openings and the related property and equipment purchases in any given period. during 2015, we opened 730 new stores and remodeled or relocated 881 stores.
significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2014 included the following approximate amounts: $127 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $102 million for new leased stores; $64 million for distribution and transportation-related projects; $38 million for stores built by us; and $35 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. during 2014, we opened 700 new stores and remodeled or relocated 915 stores. cash flows from investing activities decreased from 2013 to 2014, due primarily to a sale-leaseback transaction in 2013 (more fully described below).
significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2013 included the following approximate amounts: $187 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $124 million for new leased stores; $112 million for distribution centers, which included a significant portion of the construction cost of a distribution center in pennsylvania; $76 million for stores purchased or built by us; and $28 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. during 2013, we opened 650 new stores and remodeled or relocated 582 stores. our sale-leaseback transaction which we consummated in january 2014 for 233 of our stores resulted in proceeds from the sale of these properties of approximately $281.6 million.
capital expenditures during 2016 are projected to be in the range of $550-$600 million. we anticipate funding 2016 capital requirements with existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, and we also expect to have significant availability under our revolving facility if necessary. we plan to continue to invest in store growth and development of approximately 900 new stores and approximately 875 stores to be remodeled or relocated. capital expenditures in 2016 are anticipated to support our store growth as well as our remodel and relocation initiatives, including capital outlays for leasehold
34
improvements, fixtures and equipment; the construction of new stores; costs to support and enhance our supply chain initiatives including new and existing distribution center facilities; technology initiatives; as well as routine and ongoing capital requirements.
cash flows from financing activities.    in 2015, we repurchased 17.6 million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of $1.3 billion. we made repayments of $500.0 million on the balance of the term facility, and had proceeds of $499.2 million from the issuance of senior notes. net borrowings under the revolving facility during 2015 were $251.0 million.
in 2014, we repurchased 14.1 million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of $800.1 million. we made repayments of $75.0 million on the balance of the term facility. borrowings and repayments under the revolving facility during the 2014 period were the same amount, resulting in no net increase to amounts outstanding under the revolving facility during 2014.
the 2013 cash flows from financing activities reflect a refinancing in april 2013, including the issuance of long-term obligations which includes the $1.0 billion unsecured term facility and the issuance of senior notes totaling approximately $1.3 billion. proceeds from these transactions were used to repay our previous secured term loan and revolving credit facilities which had balances of $1.96 billion and $155.6 million when refinanced. net repayments under the revolving facility were $130.9 million during 2013. we paid debt issuance costs and hedging fees totaling $29.2 million in 2013 related to the refinancing. also in 2013, we repurchased 11.0 million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of $620.1 million.
accounting standards in february 2016, the fasb issued new guidance related to lease accounting. this guidance requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee will account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet, with differing methodology for income statement recognition. this guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. a modified retrospective approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements. we are currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, and we are anticipating a material impact because of our significant volume of lease contracts.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("u.s. gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. in addition to the estimates presented below, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined below. we believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used, the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole.
management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates. management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our principal accounting policies.
35
merchandise inventories.    merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market ("lcm") with cost determined using the retail last in, first out ("lifo") method. we use the retail inventory method ("rim") to calculate gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost, which are computed utilizing a calculated cost-to-retail inventory ratio at an inventory department level. we apply the rim to these departments, which are groups of products that are fairly uniform in terms of cost, selling price relationship and turnover. the rim will result in valuing inventories at lcm if permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain management judgments and estimates that may impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the gross profit recognized. these judgments include ensuring departments consist of uniform products, recording estimated shrinkage between physical inventories, and timely recording of markdowns needed to sell inventory.
we perform an annual lifo analysis whereby all merchandise units are considered for inclusion in the index formulation. an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. in contrast, interim lifo calculations are based on management's annual estimates of sales and the rate of inflation or deflation, as well as year-end inventory levels. we also perform analyses for determining obsolete inventory, adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an lcm value based on various management assumptions including estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded, but required to liquidate such inventory in future periods.
factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on changes in competitors' practices, consumer preferences, consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns. certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases of excess inventory. the amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year to year.
we perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis. we calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period. this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store, at a department level, based on the store's most recent historical shrink rate. to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated accrual, our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual results.
we believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the rim results in a merchandise inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis.
goodwill and other intangible assets.    the qualitative and quantitative assessments related to the valuation and any potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are each subject to judgments and/or assumptions. the analysis of qualitative factors may include determining the appropriate factors to consider and the relative importance of those factors along with other assumptions. if required, judgments in the quantitative testing process may include projecting future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, correctly applying valuation techniques, correctly computing the implied fair value of goodwill if necessary, and other assumptions. future cash flow projections are based on management's projections and represent best estimates taking into account recent financial performance, market trends, strategic plans and other available information, which in recent years have been materially accurate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment, however, such a conclusion is not indicated by recent analyses. future indicators of impairment could result in an asset impairment charge. if these judgments or assumptions are incorrect or flawed, the analysis could be negatively impacted.
36
our most recent testing of our goodwill and indefinite lived trade name intangible assets was completed during the third quarter of 2015. no indicators of impairment were evident and no assessment of or adjustment to these assets was required. we are not currently projecting a decline in cash flows that could be expected to have an adverse effect such as a violation of debt covenants or future impairment charges.
property and equipment.    property and equipment are recorded at cost. we group our assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straight-line basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class, except for leasehold improvements, which are amortized over the lesser of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. certain store and warehouse fixtures, when fully depreciated, are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts. the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of depreciable lives involves judgments and the use of estimates, which we believe have been materially accurate in recent years.
impairment of long-lived assets.    impairment of long-lived assets results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets. our estimate of undiscounted future store cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict. if our estimates of future cash flows are not materially accurate, our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly. if a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset's estimated fair value. the fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows (discounted at our credit adjusted risk-free rate) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value. although not currently anticipated, changes in these estimates, assumptions or projections could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment.
insurance liabilities.    we retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers' compensation, employee health, property loss, automobile and general liability. these represent significant costs primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores. provisions are made for these liabilities on an undiscounted basis. certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends, which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate. if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns, or other unanticipated events affect the number and significance of future claims, we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions, which could be material to our future financial results.
contingent liabilitiesincome taxes.    income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes. these standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a two-step process. a determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, based upon the technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. if the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position. uncertain tax positions require determinations and liabilities to be estimated based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation. if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results.
contingent liabilitieslegal matters.    we are subject to legal, regulatory and other proceedings and claims. we establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present, in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial statements and sec filings, management's view of our exposure. we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss,

which includes an analysis of whether such loss estimates are probable, reasonably possible, or remote. we re-evaluate these assessments on a quarterly basis or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted. the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability. in addition, because it is not permissible under u.s. gaap to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable, in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss (upon verdict and judgment at trial, for example, or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement).
lease accounting and excess facilities.    many of our stores are subject to build-to-suit arrangements with landlords, which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options. we also have stores subject to shorter-term leases and many of these leases have renewal options. certain of our stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume. we recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable. we record minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the base, non-cancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord, which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures. when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent. tenant allowances, to the extent received, are recorded as deferred incentive rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. we reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid. improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.
share-based payments.    our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the black-scholes-merton closed form option pricing model. we believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our stock option awards. the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the valuation of stock options, which affects compensation expense related to these options. these assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding, the historical volatility of our stock price, applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock. other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of share-based payments include estimated forfeiture rates of share-based awards. historically, these estimates have been materially accurate; however, if our estimates differ materially from actual experience, we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense, which could be material to our future financial results.
fair value measurements.    accounting standards for the measurement of fair value of assets and liabilities establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within level 3 of the hierarchy). therefore, level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity, and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates. currently, we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on level 3 inputs.
our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our outstanding debt instruments. we use various valuation models in determining the values of these liabilities. we believe that in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations.

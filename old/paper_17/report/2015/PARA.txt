risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could affect our business and financial results. the factors described below are considered to be the most significant. there may be other currently unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on the company's future results. past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. the following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k.
a decline in advertising expenditures could cause the company's revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its broadcast and basic cable networks, television stations, radio stations, syndicated programming, and digital properties. a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers, the economy in general or the economy of any individual geographic market, particularly a major market, such as los angeles, new york or chicago, in which the company owns and operates sizeable businesses, could alter current or prospective advertisers' spending priorities. natural and other disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services, uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. advertising expenditures may also be affected by increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences. in addition, advertising expenditures by companies in certain sectors of the economy, including the automotive, financial and pharmaceutical segments, represent a significant portion of the company's advertising revenues. any political, economic, social or technological change resulting in a reduction in these sectors' advertising expenditures may adversely affect the company's revenue. advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from the company may also be affected by a decline in audience ratings for the company's programming, the inability of the company to retain the rights to popular programming, increasing audience fragmentation caused by new program channels and the proliferation of media formats, including the internet and video‐on‐demand and the deployment of portable digital video devices and new technologies, which allow consumers to live stream and time shift programming, make and store digital copies and skip or fast‐forward i-19
through advertisements. in addition, the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending toward digital and mobile offerings from more traditional media, or toward new ways of purchasing advertising, such as through automated purchasing, dynamic advertising insertion, third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges, some or all of which may not be as beneficial to the company as traditional advertising methods. any reduction in advertising expenditures could have an adverse effect on the company's revenues and results of operations.
the company's success and profitability are dependent upon audience acceptance of its content, including its television and radio programs and motion pictures, which is difficult to predict television, radio, motion picture and other content production and distribution are inherently risky businesses because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of such content, and the licensing of rights to the associated intellectual property, depend primarily upon their acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. the commercial success of a program or motion picture also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs and motion pictures released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. rating points are also factors that are weighed when determining the advertising rates that the company receives. the use of evolving ratings technologies and measurements, and viewership on platforms or devices, such as tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices, that is not being measured, could have an impact on the company's program ratings. for example, while c-3, a current television industry ratings system, measures live commercial viewing plus three days of dvr and video-on-demand playback, the growing viewership occurring on subsequent days of dvr and video‐on‐demand playback is excluded from c-3 and other subsequent ratings. poor ratings can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending. for example, there can be no assurance that any replacement programming on the company's radio or television stations will generate the same level of revenues or profitability of previous programming. in addition, the success of the company's cable networks and simon & schuster is similarly dependent on audience acceptance of its programming and publications, respectively. the theatrical success of a motion picture, based in large part upon audience acceptance, is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment sales, licensing fees and other exploitation during the various other distribution windows. consequently, low public acceptance of the company's content, including its television and radio programs, motion pictures and publications, will have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations. in addition, any decreased popularity of programming for which the company has incurred significant commitments could have an adverse effect on its profitability. programming and talent commitments of the company, estimated to aggregate approximately $11.91 billion as of december 31, 2015, primarily included $9.21 billion for sports programming rights, $1.79 billion relating to the production and licensing of television, radio, and film programming, and $905 million for talent contracts with $2.95 billion of these amounts payable in and after 2021. a shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of the sports events for which the company has acquired rights, or in the television and radio programming the company expects to distribute, could lead to decreased profitability or losses for a significant period of time.
failure by the company to obtain, create and retain the rights related to popular programming could adversely affect the company's revenues the company's revenue from its television, radio, cable networks and motion picture business is partially dependent on the company's continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behavior on a timely basis. moreover, the company derives a portion of its revenues from the exploitation of its extensive library of television programming. generally, a television series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication, however, increasingly, these time frames are being shortened. if the content of its television programming library ceases to be widely accepted by audiences or is not continuously replenished with popular content, the company's revenues could be adversely affected. the company obtains a significant portion of its popular programming from third parties. for example, some of cbs television network's most widely viewed broadcasts, including golf's masters tournament, the pga championship, nfl games, ncaa division i men's basketball tournament games, and series such as the big bang theory, are made available based upon programming rights of varying duration that the company has negotiated with third parties. in addition, showtime networks enters into commitments to acquire rights to certain programming for showtime, the movie channel and flix from motion i-20
picture producers and other suppliers for varying durations, and cbs radio acquires the broadcast rights to syndicated shows and to various programs such as sports events from third parties. cbs films competes for compelling source material for and the talent necessary to produce motion pictures, as well as with other buyers for the acquisition of third‐party produced motion pictures. competition for popular programming that is licensed from third parties is intense, and the company may be outbid by its competitors for the rights to new, popular programming or in connection with the renewal of popular programming currently licensed by the company. the company's failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content could adversely affect the company's revenues.
the company must respond to rapid changes in technology, content creation, services and standards in order to remain competitive video, telecommunications, radio and data services technologies used in the entertainment industry are changing rapidly as are the digital publishing and distribution models for books. advances in technologies or alternative methods of product delivery or storage, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery and storage, could have a negative effect on the company's businesses. examples of the foregoing include the convergence of television broadcasts and online delivery of programming to televisions and other devices, video-on-demand platforms, tablets, satellite radio, new video and electronic book formats, user-generated content sites, internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading, and place-shifting of content from the home to portable devices on which content is viewable outside the home. for example, devices that allow users to view or listen to television or radio programs on a time-delayed basis; technologies, such as dvrs, that enable users to fast-forward or skip advertisements or increase the sharing of subscription content; systems that allow users to access copyrighted product of the company over the internet or other media; and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to view programming or store or make portable copies of programming, may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company's offerings to advertisers and adversely affect its revenues. also, the growing uses of user-generated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages, may adversely impact the company's businesses. in addition, further increases in the use of internet-connected television or other digital devices, which allow users to consume content of their own choosing, in their own time and remote locations while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements or subscription payments, could adversely affect the company's radio and television broadcasting advertising and subscription revenues. users who reduce, cancel or never had cable television subscription services are also known as "cord-cutters" or "cord-nevers". cable providers and dbs operators are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences, reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television marketplace into more specialized niche audiences. more television and video programming options increase competition for viewers and competitors targeting programming to narrowly defined audiences may gain an advantage over the company for television advertising and subscription revenues. television manufacturers, cable providers and others are developing and offering technology to enable viewers to locate digital copies of programming from the internet to view on television monitors or other devices, which could diminish viewership of the company's programming. generally, changing consumer behavior may impact the company's traditional distribution methods, for example, by reducing viewership of its programming (including motion pictures), the demand for dvd and blu-ray disc product and/or the desire to see motion pictures in theaters, which could have an adverse impact on the company's revenues and profitability. also, the impact of technological changes on traditional distributors of video programming may adversely affect the company's cable networks' ability to grow revenue. anticipating and adapting to changes in technology on a timely basis and exploiting new sources of revenue from these changes will affect the company's ability to continue to increase its revenue.
piracy of the company's programming and other content, including digital piracy, may decrease revenue received from the exploitation of the company's programming and other content and adversely affect its businesses and profitability piracy of programming (including motion pictures), books and other copyrighted material is prevalent in many parts of the world and is made easier by the availability of digital copies of content and technological advances allowing conversion of such programming and other content into digital formats, which facilitate the creation, i-21
transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of the company's content. technological advances, which facilitate the streaming of programming via the internet to television screens and other devices, may increase piracy. the proliferation of unauthorized access to programming, including through unauthorized live streaming and unauthorized account sharing of subscription program services, has an adverse effect on the company's businesses and profitability because these unauthorized actions reduce the revenue that the company potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services. in addition, if piracy were to increase, it would have an adverse effect on the company's businesses and profitability. also, while legal protections exist, piracy and technological tools with which to carry it out continue to escalate, evolve and present challenges for enforcement. the company vigorously defends itself against entities that illegally secure and exhibit its content, including streaming the company's content without obtaining the consent of or paying compensation to the company. failure of legal protections to evolve and enable enhanced enforcement efforts to combat piracy could make it more difficult for the company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which could negatively impact its value and further increase the company's enforcement costs.
the company's businesses operate in highly competitive and consolidating industries the company competes with other media companies for high quality content to achieve large audiences and to generate advertising revenue. the company also competes for distribution on various mvpd and other third-party digital platforms. the company's ability to attract audiences and advertisers and obtain favorable distribution depends in part on its ability to provide popular television programming and radio programming, motion pictures and books. the consolidation of advertising agencies, distributors and television service providers also has made competition for audiences, advertising revenue, and distribution more intense. in addition, consolidation among book retailers and the growth of on-line sales and electronic books sales have resulted in increased competition for limited physical shelf space for the company's publications and for the attention of consumers on-line. competition for audiences and advertising comes from: broadcast television stations and networks; cable television systems and networks; motion picture studios; the internet; non-traditional programming services; technological innovations in content distribution; terrestrial and satellite radio and portable devices; local, regional and national newspapers; direct mail; and other communications and advertising media that operate in these markets. other television and radio stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming, a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with the company's stations or networks, or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns. in book publishing, competition among electronic and print book retailers could decrease the prices for new releases and the outlets available for book sales. moreover, the growing use of self-publishing technologies by authors increases competition and could result in decreased use of traditional publishing services. this competition could result in lower ratings and advertising and subscription and other revenues or increased content costs and promotional and other expenses and, consequently, lower earnings and cash flow for the company. the company cannot be assured that it will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing, new or potential competitors, or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.
the loss of affiliation agreements or retransmission agreements could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations the cbs television network provides its affiliates with up to approximately 98 hours of regularly scheduled programming per week. in return, the cbs television network's affiliated stations broadcast network-inserted commercials during that programming and pay the company station affiliation fees. loss of station affiliation agreements of the cbs television network could adversely affect the company's results of operations by reducing the reach of the company's programming and therefore its attractiveness to advertisers, and renewal of these affiliation agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect the company's results of operations. the non-renewal or termination of retransmission agreements with mvpds or continued distribution on less favorable terms, could also adversely affect the company's revenues and its ability to distribute its network programming to a nationwide audience and affect the company's ability to sell advertising, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. showtime networks, cbs sports network and smithsonian networks are also dependent upon the maintenance of distribution agreements with mvpds and other third-party digital platforms and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to such programmers.
i-22
the loss of one or more of these arrangements could reduce the distribution of showtime networks', cbs sports network's and smithsonian networks' program services and reduce revenues from subscriber fees and advertising, as applicable. further, the loss of favorable packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities with any distributor could reduce revenues from subscriber fees. also, consolidation among mvpds and increased vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect the company's ability to maintain or obtain distribution for its network programming or distribution and/or marketing of its subscription program services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. in addition, mvpds are developing alternative offerings for consumers which are generally smaller than the traditional program package or may allow the consumer to customize its package of program services. to the extent these packages do not include the company's programming and become widely accepted in lieu of traditional program packages, the company could experience a decline in affiliate and subscription revenues.
the company's operating results are subject to seasonal variations and other factors the company's business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal advertising patterns and seasonal influences, on people's viewing, reading, attendance and listening habits. typically, the company's revenue from advertising increases in the fourth quarter, simon & schuster generates a substantial portion of its revenues in the fourth quarter, and license fees for television programming and cbs films' revenue from motion pictures are dependent on the timing, mix, number and availability of the company's television programming and motion pictures, as applicable, which may cause operating results to increase or decrease during a period and create non-comparable results relative to the corresponding period in the prior year. in addition, advertising revenues in even-numbered years benefit from advertising placed by candidates for political offices. the effects of such seasonality make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and may adversely affect operating results.
economic conditions may adversely affect the company's businesses and customers the u.s. and other countries where the company operates have experienced slowdowns and volatilities in their economies. a downturn could lead to lower consumer and business spending for the company's products and services, particularly if customers, including advertisers, subscribers, licensees, retailers, theater operators and other consumers of the company's content offerings and services, reduce demands for the company's products and services. in addition, in unfavorable economic environments, the company's customers may have difficulties obtaining capital at adequate or historical levels to finance their ongoing business and operations and may face insolvency, all of which could impair their ability to make timely payments and continue operations, including distribution of the company's content. the company is unable to predict the duration and severity of weakened economic conditions and such conditions and resultant effects could adversely impact the company's businesses, operating results, and financial condition.
volatility and weakness in capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs for the company bank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. if the disruption in these markets is prolonged, the company's ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of its debt could be adversely affected. although the company can currently access the bank and capital markets, there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for the company. in addition, the company's access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by the company's short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies. these factors, including the tightening of credit markets, or a decrease in the company's debt ratings, could adversely affect the company's ability to obtain cost‐effective financing.
increased programming and content costs may adversely affect the company's profits the company produces and acquires programming (including motion pictures) and other content and incurs costs with respect to its content, including for all types of creative talent, including actors, authors, writers and producers, composers and publishers of music, as well as for marketing and distribution. an increase in any of these costs and i-23
increased competition from consolidated entities and new entrants into the market for the production and acquisition of new content may lead to decreased profitability.
changes in communications laws or other regulations may have an adverse effect on the company's business the television and radio broadcasting and distribution industries in the u.s. are highly regulated by u.s. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the fcc. the television and radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act. for example, the company is required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate its radio and television stations. the company cannot be assured that the fcc will approve its future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full terms or will not include conditions or qualifications. the non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of the company's licenses could have a material adverse effect on the company's revenues. the company must also comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of its television and radio stations and its television networks. fcc regulations prohibit the common ownership of more than one of the top four networks, abc, cbs, fox and nbc, and limit the number of television and radio stations that a licensee can own in a market and the number of television stations that can be owned nationwide, which could restrict the company's ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require it to divest some television or radio stations. the u.s. congress and the fcc currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation and ownership of the company's radio and television properties. for example, from time to time, proposals have been advanced in the u.s. congress and at the fcc to require radio and television broadcast stations to provide advertising time to political candidates for free or at a reduced charge. any restrictions on political advertising may adversely affect the company's advertising revenues. the fcc initiated a proceeding to examine and potentially regulate more closely embedded advertising such as product placement and product integration. enhanced restrictions affecting these means of delivering advertising messages may adversely affect the company's advertising revenues. changes to the media ownership and other fcc rules may affect the competitive landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by the company. proposals have also been advanced from time to time before the u.s. congress and the fcc to extend the program access rules (currently applicable only to those cable program services which also own or are owned by cable distribution systems) to all cable program services. the company's ability to obtain the most favorable terms available for its content could be adversely affected should such an extension be enacted into law. in response to the fcc's march 2010 national broadband plan, which seeks to provide affordable broadband access throughout the u.s., congress passed legislation in february 2012 authorizing the fcc to conduct voluntary auctions of spectrum utilized by broadcast television stations to provide additional spectrum for wireless broadband services. the television stations that continue their operations may have to change channels once the fcc "repacks" the remaining spectrum dedicated to broadcast television use after the auction. such auctions are expected to occur in 2016 followed by repacking, which could adversely impact the company's broadcast coverage and related revenues. it is difficult to predict the timing or outcome of the fcc's actions or their effect, if any, on the company's broadcasting properties. legislation could be enacted which could remove over-the-air broadcasters' existing exemption from payment of a performance royalty to record companies and performers of music which is broadcast on radio stations and could have an adverse impact on the cost of music programming for the company. in addition, changes in or new interpretations of international laws and regulations governing competition and the internet, including those affecting data privacy, may have an adverse impact on the company's international businesses and internet properties. the company is unable to predict the effect that any such laws, regulations or policies may have on its operations.
vigorous enforcement or enhancement of fcc indecency and other program content rules against the broadcast and cable industries could have an adverse effect on the company's businesses and results of operations the fcc's rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television or radio broadcast stations between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the fcc's indecency/profanity definition, coupled i-24
with the spontaneity of live programming. the fcc enforces its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry. the fcc has found on a number of occasions that the content of radio and television broadcasts has contained indecent material. in such instances, the fcc issued fines or advisory warnings to the offending licensees. moreover, the fcc has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent "utterance," in contrast with its previous policy, which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation. the fines for broadcasting indecent material per station are a maximum of $325,000 per utterance. if the fcc denied a license renewal or revoked the license for one of the company's broadcast radio or television stations, the company would lose its authority to operate the station. the determination of whether content is indecent is inherently subjective and, as such, it can be difficult to predict whether particular content could violate indecency standards. the difficulty in predicting whether individual programs, words or phrases may violate the fcc's indecency rules adds significant uncertainty to the company's ability to comply with the rules. violation of the indecency rules could lead to sanctions which may adversely affect the company's businesses and results of operations. some policymakers support the extension of the indecency rules that are applicable to over-the-air broadcasters to cover cable and satellite programming and/or attempts to increase enforcement of or otherwise expand existing laws and rules. if such an extension, attempt to increase enforcement or other expansion took place and were found to be constitutional, some of the company's cable content could be subject to additional regulation and might not be able to attract the same subscription and viewership levels.
the failure or destruction of satellites and transmitter facilities that the company depends upon to distribute its programming could materially adversely affect the company's businesses and results of operations the company uses satellite systems to transmit its broadcast and cable networks to affiliates. the distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters including extreme weather that impair on-ground uplinks or downlinks, or as a result of an impairment of a satellite. currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. if a disruption occurs, failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company's businesses and results of operations. each of the company's television and radio stations and cable networks uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction. failure to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company's businesses and results of operations.
breach of security measures regarding information systems could disrupt operations and damage the company's reputation and could materially adversely affect the company's businesses and results of operations network and information systems and other technologies are important to the company's business activities. despite the company's security measures, network and information systems‐related events, such as computer hackings, cyber threats, security breaches, viruses, or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns or malicious or other activities, and natural or other disasters could result in a disruption of the company's services and operations. these events could also result in the improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, including through third parties which receive any of such information on a confidential basis for business purposes and could be subject to any of these events, and damage the company's reputation and require the company to expend resources to remedy any such breaches. the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and results of operations.
the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, fcc licenses and programming the company will test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including fcc licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment. a downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets, including fcc licenses, could result in a non-cash impairment charge. also, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision i-25
in the fair value of such assets. any such impairment charge for goodwill, intangible assets and/or programming could have a material adverse effect on the company's reported net earnings.
dividends and dividend rates cannot be guaranteed the company's board of directors assesses relevant factors when considering the declaration of a dividend on the company's common stock. the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to declare dividends, including at the same or similar rates.
the loss of key personnel, including talent, could disrupt the management or operations of the company's business and adversely affect its revenues the company's business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of its chief executive officer and other key employees and entertainment personalities. the company believes that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by its executive officers would be difficult to replace, and that the loss of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company, including the impairment of the company's ability to execute its business strategy. while the company does not maintain a written succession plan with respect to chairman of the board, in accordance with the company's corporate governance guidelines, designated independent committees of the cbs board together periodically review succession planning for the position of chairman and report to the non-management directors of the cbs board. because approximately 79.5% of the voting shares are controlled by sumner redstone there can be no assurance now or in the future that he or the successors to the voting control may not seek to effect succession of the chairman; however, and in all cases, the board will elect the next chairman by a majority vote of the board. additionally, the company employs or independently contracts with several entertainment personalities and authors with significant loyal audiences or readership. entertainment personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of a television or radio station and, therefore, the ability of the station to sell advertising, and an author's popularity can be significantly responsible for the success of a particular book. the company's cable networks, cbs television studios and cbs television distribution produce programming and cbs films produces motion pictures with highly regarded directors, actors and other talent who are important to attracting and retaining audiences for their content. there can be no assurance that these entertainment personalities, authors and talent will remain with or be drawn to the company or will retain their current audiences or readership. if the company fails to retain or attract these entertainment personalities, authors and talent or they lose their current audiences or readership, the company's revenues could be adversely affected.
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations certain of the company's revenues are earned and expenses are incurred in foreign currencies. the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the u.s. dollar. as a result, the company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations.
the company's liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses could adversely impact its financial condition the company has both recognized and potential liabilities and costs related to discontinued operations and former businesses, certain of which are unrelated to the media business, including leases, guarantees, environmental liabilities, liabilities related to the pensions and medical expenses of retirees, asbestos liabilities, contractual disputes and other pending and threatened litigation. the company cannot be assured that its reserves are sufficient to cover these liabilities in their entirety or any one of these liabilities when it becomes due or at what point any of these liabilities may come due. therefore, there can be no assurances that these liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, operating performance or cash flow.
i-26
the company could be adversely affected by strikes and other union activity the company and its suppliers engage the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. if the company or its suppliers are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions or others could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect the company's television, radio, cable networks, interactive and motion picture businesses by disrupting the company's ability to provide scheduled services and programming or by causing delays in the production of the company's television or radio programming or motion pictures. depending on its duration, any lockout, strike or work stoppage could have an adverse effect on the company's revenues, cash flows and/or operating income and/or the timing thereof.
political and economic risks associated with the company's international businesses could harm the company's financial condition or results of operations the company's businesses operate and have customers worldwide. inherent risks of doing business in international markets include, among other risks, changes in the economic environment, export restrictions, exchange controls, tariffs and other trade barriers and longer payment cycles. the company may incur substantial expense as a result of the imposition of new restrictions or changes in the existing economic environment in the regions where it does business. in addition, acts of terrorism or other hostilities, or other future financial, political, economic or other uncertainties, could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures, which could materially adversely affect the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
nai, through its voting control of the company, is in a position to control actions that require stockholder approval nai, through its direct and indirect ownership of the company's class a common stock, has voting control of the company. mr. sumner m. redstone, the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of nai, serves as chairman emeritus of the company's board of directors, and ms. shari redstone, the president and a director of nai, serves as vice chair of the company's board of directors. in addition, mr. david r. andelman is a director of nai and serves as a director of the company. nai is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require stockholder approval, including the election of directors and transactions involving a change of control. other stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of the corporate actions of the company for so long as nai retains voting control.
sales of shares of common stock by nai could adversely affect the stock price nai, through its direct and indirect ownership of the company's class a common stock, has voting control of the company.  based on information received from nai, shares of the company's voting class a common stock and non-voting class b common stock owned by certain wholly‐owned subsidiaries of nai are pledged to such subsidiaries' lenders.  nai holds more than 50% of the company's voting class a shares directly and these shares are not pledged. if any of such subsidiaries defaults on its obligations and the lenders foreclose on the collateral, the lenders or anyone to whom the lenders transfer the company's shares could sell such shares or convert those shares of voting class a common stock into shares of non-voting class b common stock and sell such shares, which could adversely affect the company's share price. additionally, if the lenders foreclose on the pledged shares of voting class a common stock, nai will no longer directly or indirectly own those shares and such lenders or other transferees would have voting rights in the company. in addition, there can be no assurance that nai or its subsidiaries at some future time will not sell or pledge additional shares of the company's stock, which could adversely affect the company's share price.

many factors may cause the stock price of the company's class a common stock and class b common stock to fluctuate the stock price of class a common stock and class b common stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors. these factors, some or all of which are beyond the company's control, include: actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company's operating results; changes in expectations as to the company's future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities analysts; success of the company's operating and growth strategies; investor anticipation of strategic, technological or regulatory threats, whether or not warranted by actual events; operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; and realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors. in addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading prices of the company's common stock, regardless of the company's actual operating performance.
the businesses of the company and viacom inc. will be attributable to the other company for certain regulatory purposes, which may limit business opportunities so long as the company and viacom inc. are under common control, each company's businesses, as well as the businesses of any other commonly controlled company, will be attributable to the other company for purposes of certain rules and regulations of the fcc, u.s. and non-u.s. antitrust rules and regulations and certain rules regarding political campaign contributions in the u.s., among others potentially. the businesses of one company will continue to be attributable to the other company for certain fcc and other purposes even after the two companies cease to be commonly controlled, if the two companies share common officers, directors, or attributable stockholders. as a result, the businesses and conduct of viacom inc. may have the effect of limiting and affecting the activities, strategic business alternatives and business terms available to the company, including limitations to which the company contractually agreed in connection with the company's separation of former viacom inc. ("former viacom") into two publicly traded entities, cbs corporation and new viacom inc., which was completed on december 31, 2005 (the "separation").
in connection with the separation, each company will rely on the other company's performance under various agreements between the companies in connection with the separation, the company and viacom inc. entered into various agreements, including a separation agreement dated december 19, 2005, a tax matters agreement dated december 30, 2005, which are filed as exhibits to this report, and certain related party arrangements pursuant to which the company and viacom inc. will provide services and products to each other from and after the separation. the separation agreement sets forth the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of the company and viacom inc. following the separation, and includes indemnification obligations for such liabilities and obligations. in addition, pursuant to the tax matters agreement, certain income tax liabilities and related responsibilities are allocated between, and indemnification obligations are assumed by, each of the company and viacom inc. each company will rely on the other to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. certain of the liabilities to be assumed or indemnified by the company or viacom inc. under these agreements are legal or contractual liabilities of the other company. if viacom inc. were to breach or be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the company could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses.
certain members of management, directors and stockholders may face actual or potential conflicts of interest the management and directors of the company may own both cbs corp. common stock and viacom inc. common stock, and both the company and viacom inc. are controlled by nai. mr. redstone, the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of nai, serves as chairman emeritus of the company and chairman emeritus of viacom inc. ms. redstone, the president and a director of nai, serves as vice chair of the board of directors of each of the company and viacom inc. mr. david r. andelman is a director of nai and serves as a director of the company. mr. frederic v. salerno is a director of viacom inc. and serves as a director of i-28
the company. this ownership overlap and these common directors could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the company's and viacom inc.'s management, directors and controlling stockholder face decisions that could have different implications for the company and viacom inc. for example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between the company and viacom inc. regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship between the company and viacom inc. thereafter. these agreements include, among others, the separation agreement, the tax matters agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. on occasion, the company and viacom inc. may compete with each other in various commercial enterprises. potential conflicts of interest could also arise if the company and viacom inc. enter into any commercial arrangements with each other in the future. each of mr. redstone and ms. redstone may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his or her time between the company and viacom inc. cbs corp.'s certificate of incorporation contains provisions related to corporate opportunities that may be of interest to both the company and viacom inc. cbs corp.'s certificate of incorporation provides that in the event that a director, officer or controlling stockholder of the company who is also a director, officer or controlling stockholder of viacom inc. acquires knowledge of a potential corporate opportunity for both the company and viacom inc., such director, officer or controlling stockholder may present such opportunity to the company or viacom inc. or both, as such director, officer or controlling stockholder deems appropriate in his or her sole discretion, and that by doing so such person will have satisfied his or her fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders. in addition, cbs corp.'s certificate of incorporation provides that the company renounces any interest in any such opportunity presented to viacom inc. these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity of one of such companies may be used for the benefit of the other company.

(a) see page ii-6 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap").
for 2015, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations ("eps") was up 19% from 2014, reflecting higher net earnings from continuing operations and lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the company's ongoing share repurchase program and the split-off of outdoor americas inc. ("outdoor americas") in the third quarter of 2014. in 2015, eps included a pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of radio fcc licenses to their fair value, restructuring charges, and gains from the sales of internet businesses in china. in 2014, eps included an impairment charge associated with a radio station swap, restructuring charges, and a loss on early extinguishment of debt. on an adjusted basis, excluding these discrete items, eps increased 12%. the company believes that presenting its financial results adjusted for the impact of these discrete items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the company's management and provides a clearer perspective on the underlying performance of the company. these adjusted results are non-gaap financial measures. see page ii-6 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with gaap.

(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
for 2015, the 1% increase in revenues reflected continued growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues, partially offset by lower advertising and content licensing and distribution revenues. affiliate and subscription fees increased 15% as a result of growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues, reflecting the benefit from recently renegotiated agreements, as well as higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. advertising revenues decreased 3% primarily reflecting lower local advertising revenues as a result of the benefit in 2014 from midterm elections and lower radio advertising sales. total advertising revenues benefited from 1% growth in network advertising, which increased despite fewer sporting events broadcast on the cbs television network. content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 2% reflecting lower domestic television licensing revenues, which were partially offset by higher international television licensing revenues.
operating income was down 17% from 2014. on an adjusted basis, excluding the impairment charges, restructuring charges, and gains from the sales of internet businesses in china, operating income declined 4% primarily as a result of increased investment in programming and new digital distribution initiatives.
the company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1.42 billion in 2015 and $1.21 billion in 2014. included in operating cash flow for 2014 were payments of $360 million associated with the early extinguishment of debt, primarily for early redemption premiums. free cash flow for 2015 was $1.23 billion compared with $1.00 billion for 2014. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure. see "free cash flow" on pages ii-27 and ii-28 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with gaap, to free cash flow.

advertising for 2015, the 3% decrease in advertising revenues was principally driven by lower local advertising revenues, mainly from the benefit to 2014 from midterm elections and 6% lower radio advertising revenues. these declines were partially offset by growth in network advertising revenues, which increased 1% despite the broadcast of fewer sporting events on the cbs television network in 2015. the increase in network advertising reflects higher scatter pricing in the second half of the year, primarily as a result of increased demand. the increase is also driven by more inventory available to be sold at higher prices in the scatter market as a result of fewer units sold prior to the start of the 2015/2016 television broadcast season ("upfront") compared with the 2014/2015 season. (see pages i-2 and ii-8 for further descriptions of the scatter and upfront advertising markets.)

management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
in 2016, national and local advertising revenues will benefit from the cbs television network's broadcast of the super bowl, which airs on the cbs television network once every three years through 2022 under the current contract with the national football league ("nfl"). the local advertising revenue comparison will also benefit from higher political advertising spending, mainly in the second half of the year, associated with the u.s. presidential election. for national advertising, the cbs television network's upfront for the 2015/2016 television broadcast season, which runs from the middle of september 2015 through the middle of september 2016, resulted in pricing increases and lower overall volume compared with the prior season. as a result, more advertising spots are available in the scatter advertising market, when advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming. overall advertising revenues for the company will be dependent on demand in the overall advertising marketplace and ratings for its programming.
content licensing and distribution content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally produced television programming for multiple media platforms and in various geographic locations; fees from the distribution of third party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. for 2015, the 2% decrease in content licensing and distribution revenues reflects lower domestic television licensing revenues, partially offset by higher international television licensing revenues. significant contributors to domestic television licensing revenues in 2015 included elementary and ncis, while 2014 included blue bloods, hawaii five-0, and dexter.
content licensing and distribution revenue comparisons are impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of company-owned television series for multi-year licensing agreements. television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition. unrecognized revenues attributable to license agreements for produced programming that is not yet available for exhibition were $847 million and $1.02 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as of the end of 2015 the company had approximately 400 episodes of scripted original programming that had not yet been made available in the secondary domestic marketplace (see page ii-46 for a description of the secondary marketplace).
total outstanding receivables attributable to revenues recognized under licensing agreements at december 31, 2015 and 2014 were $3.83 billion and $3.57 billion, respectively. at december 31, 2015, the total amount due from these receivables was $1.69 billion in 2016, $1.03 billion in 2017, $552 million in 2018, $348 million in 2019, and $214 million in 2020 and thereafter.
affiliate and subscription fees affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from mvpds for carriage of the company's cable networks ("cable affiliate fees"), as well as for authorizing the mvpds' carriage of the company's owned television stations ("retransmission fees"); fees received from television stations affiliated with the cbs television network ("station affiliation fees"); subscription fees for online content; and revenues received for the distribution of pay-per-view boxing events. for 2015, the 15% increase in affiliate and subscription fees reflects growth in station affiliation fees, retransmission fees, and cable affiliate fees from growth in rates; higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events; and revenues from new digital distribution platforms. in 2016, the company expects continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees. over the next few years the company expects to renew a significant portion of its agreements with station affiliates and mvpds. this, along with the company's new digital distribution initiatives, including cbs all access and showtime's digital streaming subscription offering, are expected to result in continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees over the next several years.

programming expenses reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the television broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. for 2015, programming expenses remained flat with 2014 as increased sports programming costs associated with higher revenues from nfl broadcasts and pay-per-view boxing events were offset by lower costs for acquired television series as a result of a shift to a higher mix of internally developed television series.
production expenses reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally developed television and theatrical film content, as well as television and radio costs, including on-air talent and other production costs. for 2015, the 13% increase in production expenses reflects an increased investment in internally developed television series as well as higher costs associated with the mix of titles sold under television licensing agreements in 2015 compared with 2014. the company produced approximately 20% more hours of original scripted programming in 2015 compared with 2014.
participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television content, such as print and advertising. for 2015, the 6% decrease in participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily reflects lower participations and residuals associated with the decrease in licensing revenues.
other operating expenses primarily include compensation and costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing.

for 2015, the 4% increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the 19% increase in diluted eps from continuing operations was driven by a 2014 loss on early extinguishment of debt of $352 million ($219 million, net of tax) and 2015 gains from the sales of internet businesses in china of $139 million ($131 million, net of tax), partially offset by a 2015 impairment charge of $484 million ($297 million, net of tax) to reduce the carrying value of radio fcc licenses to their fair value. the diluted eps comparison also benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the company's ongoing share repurchase program and the split-off of outdoor americas during the third quarter of 2014.

company's plan to dispose of outdoor americas, in january 2014 outdoor americas borrowed $1.60 billion. on april 2, 2014, outdoor americas completed an initial public offering ("ipo") through which it sold 23.0 million shares, or approximately 19%, of its common stock for $28.00 per share. proceeds from the ipo aggregated $615 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions. the company received $2.04 billion of the combined ipo and debt proceeds from outdoor americas. on july 16, 2014, the company completed the disposition of its 81% ownership of outdoor americas common stock through a tax-free split-off (the "split-off") through which the company accepted 44.7 million shares of cbs corp. class b common stock from its stockholders in exchange for the 97.0 million shares of outdoor americas common stock that it owned. in aggregate, the company received $4.76 billion from the disposition of outdoor americas, including the cash from the ipo and debt proceeds, and the fair value of the shares of cbs corp. class b common stock that were accepted in the split-off of $2.72 billion. the split-off resulted in a gain of $1.56 billion, which is included in net earnings from discontinued operations for 2014 and is calculated as follows:
fair value of cbs corp. class b common stock accepted            $2,721

advertising for 2014, the 4% decrease in advertising revenues reflected the benefit to 2013 from the cbs television network's super bowl broadcast, which is broadcast on the cbs television network once every three years through 2022 under the current contract. additionally, four fewer ncaa division i men's basketball championship ("ncaa tournament") games were broadcast on cbs during 2014. taken together these items impacted the advertising revenue comparison by five percentage points. these decreases were partially offset by the addition of thursday night football on cbs in 2014 as well as political advertising spending associated with midterm elections.

(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
content licensing and distribution for 2014, content licensing and distribution revenues were comparable with 2013 reflecting higher revenues from the licensing of the company's television programming offset by lower revenues from book sales and theatrical releases. significant contributors to television licensing revenues in 2014 included blue bloods, hawaii five-0, and dexter and in 2013 included ncis: los angeles and the good wife.
affiliate and subscription fees for 2014, the 6% increase in affiliate and subscription fees reflected higher rates across the company partially offset by lower revenues from showtime networks' distribution of pay-per-view boxing events.
international revenues international revenues primarily consist of television licensing revenues. the company generated approximately 13% of its total revenues from international regions in each of 2014 and 2013.

for 2014, the 4% decrease in programming expenses was primarily driven by the absence of costs associated with the cbs television network's broadcast of the super bowl in 2013. programming expenses for 2014 also reflected an increased investment in programming, primarily for thursday night football on cbs, partially offset by lower costs for acquired television series as a result of a shift to a higher mix of internally developed television series during 2014.
for 2014, production expenses remained flat with 2013 as an increased investment in internally developed television programming was offset by lower costs associated with the mix of titles licensed under television licensing arrangements.
for 2014, the 7% increase in participation, distribution and royalty costs was principally due to higher participations and residuals associated with the mix of titles licensed under television licensing arrangements, partially offset by lower advertising costs for feature films.

for 2014, the 22% decrease in net earnings from continuing operations and the 14% decrease in diluted eps from continuing operations reflects lower operating income and a 2014 loss on early extinguishment of debt. the diluted eps comparison benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the company's ongoing share repurchase program and the split-off of outdoor americas during 2014.

during 2013, the company completed the sale of outdoor europe for $225 million. outdoor europe is presented as a discontinued operation. for 2013, net earnings from discontinued operations include a gain on the disposal of outdoor europe and an after-tax charge of $110 million related to outdoor europe. this charge was associated with exiting an unprofitable contractual arrangement and the estimated fair value of guarantees, which historically were intercompany but upon the closing of the transaction became third-party guarantees.

segment results of operations - 2015 vs. 2014
the company presents operating income (loss) excluding restructuring charges, impairment charges, and gain on sales of businesses, if any, ("segment operating income") as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments ("segment profit measure") in accordance with fasb guidance for segment reporting. the company began presenting segment operating income as its segment profit measure in the first quarter of 2015 in order to align with the primary method the company's management began using in 2015 to evaluate segment performance and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to its segments. the company believes the presentation of segment operating income is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the company's management and enhances their ability to understand the company's operating performance. the reconciliation of segment operating income to the company's consolidated net earnings is presented in note 17 (reportable segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

2015 vs. 2014
for 2015, the 2% increase in revenues was primarily driven by 47% growth in affiliate and subscription fees. network advertising revenues increased 1%, despite the broadcast of fewer sporting events on the cbs television network in 2015, reflecting higher scatter pricing in the second half of the year, primarily as a result of increased demand. the increase is also driven by more inventory available to be sold at higher prices in the scatter market as a result of fewer units sold in the upfront for the 2015/2016 broadcast season, compared with the 2014/2015 season. overall advertising revenues for the entertainment segment remained flat as the increase in network advertising revenues was offset by the impact from the sale of an internet business in china during the first quarter of 2015. content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 3% reflecting lower domestic television licensing revenues, which were partially offset by higher international television licensing revenues. significant contributors to domestic television licensing revenues in 2015 included elementary and ncis, while 2014 included blue bloods, hawaii five-0, and criminal minds.
the decrease in operating income of 2% was primarily driven by increased investment in programming and digital distribution initiatives. for 2015 and 2014 restructuring charges primarily reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting operating facilities.
during 2016, results are expected to benefit from continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees and the cbs television network's broadcast of the super bowl, which airs on the cbs television network once every three years through 2022 under the current contract. revenue comparisons will also be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of television series for multi-year licensing agreements. television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition.

2015 vs. 2014
for 2015, the 3% increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher revenues from new long-term agreements for the international licensing of showtime original series; pay-per-view boxing events; and affiliates, as well as revenues from new digital distribution initiatives. these increases were offset by lower domestic licensing revenues as 2014 benefited from significant domestic streaming sales of dexter. as of december 31, 2015, subscriptions totaled approximately 77 million for showtime networks (including showtime, the movie channel and flix), 55 million for cbs sports network and 33 million for smithsonian networks.
operating income decreased 3% as the revenue growth was more than offset by higher costs associated with the increased pay-per-view boxing revenues and the mix of titles sold under television licensing arrangements.
during 2015, the company launched its digital streaming subscription offering of showtime that is available both on a stand-alone basis and through third-party digital platforms. subscribers to this offering have on-demand access to showtime original series, theatrical feature films, documentaries and sports-related programming, as well as the live east and west coast linear feeds of showtime.

for 2015, revenues increased slightly from 2014 with digital book sales representing 25% of publishing's total revenues. best-selling titles for 2015 included the pulitzer prize-winning 2014 release all the light we cannot see by anthony doerr, the wright brothers by david mccullough and finders keepers by stephen king.
the increase in operating income of 13% primarily reflected a favorable product mix, including strong backlist and digital audio sales, and lower production and distribution costs.

2015 vs. 2014
for 2015, the 5% decrease in revenues primarily reflected lower political advertising revenues as 2014 benefited from midterm elections, as well as lower radio revenues. the lower radio revenues, which decreased 6%, reflected continued softness in the radio advertising marketplace as well as fewer radio stations and lower political revenues. cbs television stations revenues declined 5%, reflecting lower political revenues, partially offset by growth in affiliate and subscription fees.
the decrease in operating income of 13% was driven by the revenue decline, which was partially offset by lower programming and employee related costs as a result of recent cost-cutting measures. restructuring charges in 2015 and 2014 reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. in the fourth quarter of 2015, the company recorded a pretax, noncash impairment charge of $484 million to reduce the carrying value of radio fcc licenses in 18 markets to their fair value. (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). in 2014, in connection with a radio station swap with beasley broadcast group, inc., the company recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $52 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill. under the swap, the company exchanged 13 of its radio stations in tampa and charlotte as well as one radio station in philadelphia, for two radio stations in philadelphia and three radio stations in miami.
in 2016, advertising revenues are expected to benefit from increased political spending associated with the u.s. presidential election and the cbs television network's broadcast of the super bowl, which airs on the cbs television network once every three years through 2022 under the current contract. continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees is also expected in 2016.

corporate expenses include general corporate overhead, unallocated shared company expenses, pension and postretirement benefit costs for plans retained by the company for previously divested businesses, and intercompany eliminations. the decrease in corporate expenses of 7% primarily reflected lower employee-related costs and lower pension and postretirement benefit costs.

2014 vs. 2013
for 2014, the 4% decrease in revenues reflected lower advertising revenues and content licensing and distribution revenues, partially offset by growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues.  advertising revenues decreased 7%, mainly driven by the benefit to 2013 from the cbs television network's broadcast of the super bowl, which is broadcast on cbs once every three years through 2022 under the current contract, and four fewer ncaa tournament games broadcast on cbs in 2014. these decreases were partially offset by advertising revenues from the broadcast of thursday night football on cbs, which premiered on cbs in 2014. content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 2% reflecting the timing of theatrical releases and television licensing revenues. television licensing revenues in 2014 included the first-cycle domestic syndication sales of blue bloods and hawaii five-0 and in 2013 included ncis: los angeles and the good wife.
the decrease in operating income of 18% primarily reflected an increased investment in programming, primarily for nfl games. restructuring charges for 2014 primarily reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting operating facilities and 2013 principally reflected costs associated with exiting certain international operations and severance costs.

2014 vs. 2013
for 2014, the 5% increase in revenues was driven by higher revenues from the licensing of showtime original series for digital streaming, mainly dexter and californication. revenue growth also reflects higher cable affiliate fees, primarily reflecting rate increases. these increases were partially offset by lower revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. as of december 31, 2014, subscriptions totaled approximately 76 million for showtime networks (including showtime, the movie channel and flix), 55 million for cbs sports network and 30 million for smithsonian networks.
the increase in operating income of 11% was primarily a result of the increased revenues and lower programming costs from the timing of premieres.

operating activities.  in 2015, the increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations resulted from early-redemption premiums paid in 2014 in connection with the company's debt refinancing, with no comparable amount in 2015, and lower payments for income taxes, mainly resulting from federal tax refunds received in 2015. these increases were partially offset by increased investment in programming.
in 2014, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations compared with 2013 reflected the above-mentioned debt redemption premiums, as well as the benefit to 2013 from cbs's super bowl broadcast and the timing of payments for sports programming. these declines were partially offset by contributions of $150 million in 2013 to prefund the company's qualified pension plans, with no comparable amount in 2014, as well as higher collections from television licensing agreements.
cash paid for income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:

(a) cash provided by financing activities from discontinued operations for 2014 principally reflects the net proceeds from outdoor americas' long-term debt borrowings and ipo.
free cash flow free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure. free cash flow reflects the company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and including capital expenditures. the company's calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the company's operations. the company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure.
management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. as a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the company's ability to generate long-term value. it is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the company's operating performance. the company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the company's underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. in addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the company's investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the company's operating performance to other companies in its industry.
as free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with gaap, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings as a measure of operating performance. free cash flow, as the company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. in addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the company's ability to fund its cash needs. when comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable gaap financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow.

management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
at december 31, 2015, the company's scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, were as follows:
2021 and
2016                                2017               2018               2019               2020                    thereafter long-term debt         $200               $400               $300               $600               $500            $6,440
during january 2016, the company repaid its $200 million of outstanding 7.625% senior debentures upon maturity.
commercial paper at december 31, 2014 the company had outstanding commercial paper borrowings under its $2.5 billion commercial paper program of $616 million, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.46% and with maturities of less than forty-five days. there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at december 31, 2015.
credit facility at december 31, 2015, the company had a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in december 2019 (the "credit facility"). the company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the credit facility. borrowing rates under the credit facility are determined at the company's option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the u.s. or the london interbank offer rate ("libor") plus a margin based on the company's senior unsecured debt rating. the company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.
the credit facility requires the company to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 4.5x at the end of each quarter as further described in the credit facility. at december 31, 2015, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 2.6x.
the consolidated leverage ratio reflects the ratio of the company's indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the company's consolidated ebitda for the trailing four consecutive quarters.  consolidated ebitda is defined in the credit facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other noncash items.
the credit facility is used for general corporate purposes. at december 31, 2015, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the remaining availability under the credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $2.49 billion.
liquidity and capital resources the company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs.  the company's operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. the company's investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. the company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its credit facility, which had $2.49 billion of remaining availability at december 31, 2015, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.
ii-29
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
the company's funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities.  any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. to the extent that commercial paper is not available to the company, the existing credit facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. the company routinely assesses its capital structure and opportunistically enters into transactions to lower its interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.
funding for the company's long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $2.00 billion is expected to come from the company's ability to refinance its debt and cash generated from operating activities.
as of december 31, 2015, the company had $2.00 billion of remaining availability under its share repurchase program. the company expects to complete the share repurchase program by the end of 2016. this timing is subject to market and business conditions, and remains at the discretion of management. these repurchases are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.
contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015 payments due by period under the company's significant contractual obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:

approximately $52 million to its other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy the company's portion of benefit payments due under these plans.
guarantees during 2013, the company completed the sale of outdoor europe.  the company remained the guarantor of certain of outdoor europe's obligations, including franchise payment obligations under certain transit franchise agreements. generally, the company would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event of non-performance by the buyer. these agreements have varying terms, with the majority of the obligations guaranteed under these agreements expiring over the next seven years. at december 31, 2015, the company's maximum exposure under the guaranteed obligations is approximately $26 million. the carrying value of the guarantee liability of approximately $14 million and $28 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is included in "liabilities of discontinued operations" on the consolidated balance sheets.
the company also has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. at december 31, 2015, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $193 million and were not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
in the course of its business, the company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. similarly, the company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. the company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles.
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.
the company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the company's financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application.  for a summary of the company's significant accounting policies see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
programming and production costs accounting for the company's television production costs requires management's judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned ("ultimate revenues") and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program.  these estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs.  for each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs.

(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
the costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. these costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. the economic benefit is determined based on management's estimates of revenues to be derived from the programming. management's judgment is required in determining the value of the future economic benefit and timing of the expensing of these costs.
ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, which includes television series, feature films and sports, are updated regularly based on information available as the television program or film progresses through its life cycle or contractual term. overestimating ultimate revenues for internally produced programming or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and/or estimated accruals for participation expense.
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised of fcc licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test.
fcc licenses-fcc licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. the company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the company's radio or television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the fcc licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. at december 31, 2015, the company had fcc license book values for stations in 14 television markets and 25 radio markets.
for its annual impairment test, the company performs qualitative assessments for each market that management estimates has an aggregate fair value of fcc licenses that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. for the 2015 annual impairment test, the company performed qualitative assessments for 10 television markets. for each of these markets, the company weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. the market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for advertising revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. the company also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the fcc licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.
for fcc licenses in the remaining television markets and all of the radio markets, the company performed a quantitative impairment test that compares the estimated fair value of the fcc licenses by geographic market with their respective carrying values.  the estimated fair value of each fcc license is computed using the greenfield discounted cash flow method (''greenfield method''), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. the greenfield method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. the greenfield method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. the annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall advertising revenues in the relevant geographic market, the start-up station's operating costs and capital expenditures, and a three-year build-up period for the start-

(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. the overall market advertising revenue in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections. operating costs and capital expenditures are estimated based on both industry and internal data. the residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation in the u.s. and long-term industry projections. the discount rate is determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry.
the discount rates and perpetual nominal growth rates used for each television and radio station for 2015 were as follows:
discount   perpetual nominal rate       growth rate television stations   8.0%       2.5%
radio stations        7.75%      1.0%
for the 2015 quantitative impairment test, the company concluded that the estimated fair values of the fcc licenses in 18 radio markets were lower than their respective carrying values. accordingly, the company recognized a pretax noncash impairment charge of $484 million related to radio fcc licenses in these markets. this impairment was the result of a sustained decline in industry projections for the radio advertising marketplace since 2014.
for the remaining seven radio and four television markets, the company concluded that the estimated fair values of fcc licenses in each market exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was necessary. two radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of fcc licenses of $203 million, were each within 5% of their respective estimated fair value, and two radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of fcc licenses of $193 million, were each within 10% of their respective estimated fair value. in addition, the estimated fair value of one television market, which had a carrying value of fcc licenses of $167 million, exceeded its carrying value by 5%. in each of the remaining radio and television markets, the estimated fair value of fcc licenses was in excess of the respective carrying values by more than 10%.
the estimated fair values of the fcc licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the company owns and operates television and radio stations. certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a decline in the local radio or television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to the company's current assumptions and judgments. various factors may contribute to a future decline in any local radio and/or television advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of the local radio and television advertising revenues; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. a downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in further impairment and a noncash charge would be required.  such a charge could have a material effect on the company's consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet.
goodwill-goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. at december 31, 2015 the company had seven reporting units. the company's reporting units are one level below its operating segments, except for the publishing reporting unit, which is the same as its operating segment because this operating segment has only one component. for its annual impairment test, the company performs qualitative assessments for each reporting unit that management estimates have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. for the 2015 annual impairment test, the company performed qualitative assessments for three reporting units. for each of these reporting units, the company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. the reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units' carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. for each ii-33
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
industry in which the reporting units operate, the company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. the company also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units.  based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the company concluded that for these three reporting units, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount and therefore performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.
for 2015, the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for four reporting units: cbs interactive, cbs sports network, publishing and cbs radio. the first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows ("discounted cash flow method") and the traded or transaction values of comparable businesses ("market comparable method"). the discounted cash flow method and market comparable method resulted in similar estimated fair values. the discounted cash flow method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. this technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. the estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the company's internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends.  the residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. the discount rates are determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities.
for the 2015 annual impairment test, the company concluded that the estimated fair value of each of the four reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore the second step of the impairment test was unnecessary. the fair value of the cbs interactive, cbs sports network, and publishing reporting units each exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 15%, while the estimated fair value of the cbs radio reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $1.86 billion at december 31, 2015, exceeded its carrying value, after the fcc licenses impairment charge, by less than 1%. following are the assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the cbs radio reporting unit:
significant assumptions reporting unit fair   perpetual value in excess of    nominal       discount reporting unit   carrying value        growth rate   rate cbs radio        .4%                   1.5%          8.0%
certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. a downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. for the cbs radio reporting unit, considering the narrow margin between the estimated fair value and carrying value, any downward revisions to its estimated fair value could cause the fair value of the reporting unit to fall below its carrying value. the company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any noncash impairment charge. such a charge could have a material effect on the company's consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet.
reserves and legal matters estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management.  the company continually evaluates these ii-34
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (continued)
(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates.  while management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. this belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.
pensions pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate is determined based on the yield on portfolios of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet the company's pension plans' expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. the expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. as of december 31, 2015, the unrecognized actuarial losses increased from the prior year end due primarily to unfavorable performance of pension plan assets partially offset by an increase in the discount rate. a decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation. a 25 basis point change in the discount rate will result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $123 million and will not have a material impact on the 2015 pension expense. a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense.  the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $9 million to 2016 pension expense.
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.  when recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results.  in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. a number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. during 2015 and 2014, the company recognized tax benefits of $9 million and $7 million, respectively, related to the net impact of the settlement of certain prior year tax audits.  for positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.  a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated statement of operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any.  if a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. the company is continually audited by u.s. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities.  while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $104 million at december 31, 2015 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of fasb guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.
legal matters general. on an ongoing basis, the company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, ''litigation''). litigation may be brought against the company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. however, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in ii-35

(tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. under the separation agreement between the company and viacom inc., the company and viacom inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the company and/or viacom inc. is named.
claims related to former businesses: asbestos. the company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. the company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. in the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the company's products is the basis of a claim. claims against the company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use.
claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. the company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. as of december 31, 2015, the company had pending approximately 36,030 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 41,100 as of december 31, 2014 and 45,150 as of december 31, 2013. during 2015, the company received approximately 3,670 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 8,740 claims. the company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. in 2015, as the result of an insurance settlement, insurance recoveries exceeded the company's after tax costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims by approximately $5 million. in 2014, the company's costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance and taxes were approximately $11 million. the company's costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.
filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. the predominant number of claims against the company are non-cancer claims. the company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. this belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. while the number of asbestos claims filed against the company has trended down in the past five to ten years and has remained flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the company's estimate of its asbestos liabilities.
other. the company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the company. in addition, the company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the company and its predecessors.

market risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses derivative financial instruments to modify this exposure. in accordance with its policy, the company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
foreign exchange risk the company conducts business in various countries outside the u.s., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the u.s. dollar. in order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the british pound, the euro, the canadian dollar and the australian dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, which are generally up to 24 months, are used. additionally, the company designates forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. additionally, the company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-u.s. dollar denominated cash flows. the change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in "other items, net" in the consolidated statements of operations. the company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.
at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $291 million and $152 million, respectively, which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.
interest risk all of the company's long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. during 2014, in connection with the issuance of its $600 million of 2.30% senior notes due 2019, the company entered into $600 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating rate swap agreements to hedge this debt. during 2015, prior to maturity, the company settled these interest rate swaps and received $12 million in cash, plus accrued interest. the resulting increase in the carrying value of the previously hedged debt is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. the company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at december 31, 2015 but in the future may use derivatives to modify its exposure to interest rates.
credit risk the company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. however, the company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.
the company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at december 31, 2015 or 2014, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the company's products and services are sold.

risk factors to the company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. this disclosure, including that under "outlook"
and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the company in this annual report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. the company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. investors are advised, however, to consult any further public company disclosures (such as in filings with the securities and exchange commission or in company press releases) on related subjects.

item 7a.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk eastman has exposure to various market risks principally due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the pricing of various commodities, and interest rates. in an effort to manage these risks, the company employs various strategies, including pricing, inventory management, and hedging. the company enters into derivative contracts which are governed by policies, procedures, and internal processes set forth by its board of directors.
the company determines its exposures to market risk by utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates.
due to the company's operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies, the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business. the company manages most foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows it to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets. in order to mitigate foreign currency risk, the company from time to time enters into derivative transactions to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies, and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
at december 31, 2015 , the market risk associated with certain cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the u.s. dollar relative to these foreign currencies was $67 million, with an additional $7 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in those foreign currency rates. at december 31, 2014 , the market risk associated with cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the u.s. dollar relative to those currencies was $100 million, with an additional $10 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in those exchange rates.
since the company utilizes currency-sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value from those instruments is generally offset by an increase in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions.
the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its raw materials and energy, as well as contract sales of certain commodity products. to mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, ethylene, and benzene, as well as selling prices for ethylene, the company from time and time enters into derivative transactions. at december 31, 2015 and december
31, 2014 , the market risk associated with these derivative contracts, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent and no corresponding change in the selling price of finished goods, was $41 million and $71 million, respectively, with an additional $4 million and $7 million, respectively, of exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter. the decrease in market risk in 2015
compared to 2014 was due to a smaller commodity derivative portfolio at december 31, 2015.
the company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long-term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. the nature and amount of the company's long-term and short-term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. the company manages global interest rate exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies. the company had variable interest rate borrowings (including credit facility borrowings and commercial paper borrowings) of $980 million and $1.2 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. these borrowings represented 15 percent and 17 percent of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 1.17 percent and 1.23 percent at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately $1 million and $2 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the company may enter into interest rate swaps, collars, or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the company had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values totaling $500 million and $775 million, respectively. for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, the company uses a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates. the corresponding market risk associated with interest rate swaps hedging the interest rate risk for the future issuance of debt was $10 million at december 31,
2015. the corresponding market risk associated with interest rate swaps for the future issuance of debt and interest rate swaps hedging the interest rate risk on the 3.6% bonds maturing 2022 was $6 million at december 31,
2014.

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and stockholders of eastman chemical company in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of eastman chemical company (the "company") and its subsidiaries at december 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 9a. our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
as discussed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred taxes in 2015.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
1.  significant accounting policies financial statement presentation the consolidated financial statements of eastman and subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted ("gaap") in the united states and of necessity include some amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. future actual results could differ from such current estimates. the consolidated financial statements include assets, liabilities, sales revenue, and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained. eastman accounts for other joint ventures and investments in minority-owned companies where it exercises significant influence on the equity basis.
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. certain prior period data has been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to conform to current period presentation.
information related to the commonwealth laminating and coating, inc., ("commonwealth") acquisition completed on december 11, 2014, the taminco corporation ("taminco") acquisition completed on december 5, 2014, the knowlton technologies, llc ("knowlton") acquisition completed on august 6, 2014, and the bp plc global aviation turbine engine oil business ("aviation turbine oil business") acquisition completed on june 2, 2014 is in note 2 , "
acquisitions ". as of the date of acquisition, results of the acquired businesses are included in eastman results.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.
fair value measurements the company records recurring and non-recurring financial assets and liabilities as well as all non-financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. these fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels. level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the company's assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. an asset or liability's classification within the various levels is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. the allowances are based on the number of days an individual receivable is delinquent and management's regular assessment of the financial condition of the company's customers. the company considers a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after the terms of the related invoice have expired. the company evaluates the allowance based on a monthly assessment of the aged receivables. write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. allowance for doubtful accounts was $13 million and $10 million at december 31,
2015 and 2014 , respectively. the company does not enter into receivables of a long-term nature, also known as financing receivables, in the normal course of business.
77
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company assumed the rights and obligations under non-recourse factoring facilities as part of the acquisition of taminco. the non-recourse factoring facilities have a combined limit of $173 million (the u.s. dollar equivalent of the €158 million commitment amount as of december 31, 2015 ) and are committed until december 2017. these arrangements include receivables in the united states, belgium, germany, and finland, and are subject to various eligibility requirements. the company sells the receivables at face value but receives funding (approximately 85
percent ) net of a deposit amount until collections are received from customers for the receivables sold. the total amounts of cumulative receivables sold in 2015 were approximately $995 million . the total amount of cumulative receivables sold during the year ended december 31, 2014, since the acquisition of taminco on december 5, 2014 was
$70 million . as part of the program, the company continues to service the receivables at market rates with no servicing assets or liabilities recognized. the amounts of sold receivables outstanding under the non-recourse factoring facilities were $106 million and $105 million at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
the fair value of the receivables sold equals the carrying value at the time of the sale, and no gain or loss is recognized. the company is exposed to a credit loss of up to 10 percent on sold receivables.
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. the company determines the cost of most raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories in the united states and switzerland by the last-in, first-out ("lifo")
method. the cost of all other inventories is determined by the average cost method, which approximates the first-
in, first-out ("fifo") method. the company writes-down its inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
properties the company records properties at cost. maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings; replacements and betterments are capitalized. when eastman retires or otherwise disposes of assets, it removes the cost of such assets and related accumulated depreciation from the accounts. the company records any profit or loss on retirement or other disposition into earnings. asset impairments are reflected as increases in accumulated depreciation for properties that have been placed in service. in instances when an asset has not been placed in service and is impaired, the associated costs are removed from the appropriate property accounts.
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense is calculated based on historical cost and the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally using the straight-line method. estimated useful lives for buildings and building equipment generally range from 20
to 50 years. estimated useful lives generally ranging from 3 to 33 years are applied to machinery and equipment in the following categories: computer software (3 to 5 years); office furniture and fixtures and computer equipment (5
to 10 years); vehicles, railcars, and general machinery and equipment (5 to 20 years); and manufacturing-related improvements (20 to 33 years). accelerated depreciation is reported when the estimated useful life is shortened and continues to be reported in cost of sales.
amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets is generally determined using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
for additional information, see note 5 , " goodwill and other intangible assets ".
computer software costs capitalized software costs are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over three years , the expected useful life of such assets, beginning when the software project is substantially complete and placed in service.
capitalized software costs in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 were approximately $2 million , $3 million , and $5 million , respectively, and consisted of costs to internally develop computer software used by the company. during 2015, $5
million and during 2014 and 2013, $7 million, each period, of previously capitalized costs were amortized. at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , unamortized capitalized software costs were $8 million and $11 million , respectively.
capitalized software costs are reflected in other noncurrent assets.
78
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements impairment of long-lived assets definite-lived assets properties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the review of these long-lived assets is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. if the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. an impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. fair value is either salvage value determined through market analysis or alternative future use.
goodwill the company conducts testing of goodwill annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. the company conducted annual goodwill impairment testing as of july 1. in fourth quarter 2015, the annual impairment testing date was changed to october 1. this change is in response to a change in the timing of corporate forecasting, a key input to the annual impairment testing process.
the testing of goodwill is performed at the "reporting unit" level which the company has determined to be its
"components". components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a "business" as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by company operating segment management. the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities.
the company uses an income approach and applies a fair value methodology based on discounted cash flows in testing the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit. key assumptions and estimates used in the company's 2015
goodwill impairment testing included projections of revenues, expenses, and cash flows determined using the company's annual multi-year strategic plan and a market participant tax rate. the most critical assumptions are the estimated discount rate and a projected long-term growth rate. the company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made. however, actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the company's estimates. in addition, the use of different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different determinations. in order to determine the discount rate, the company uses a market perspective weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") approach. the wacc is calculated incorporating weighted average returns on debt and equity from market participants. therefore, changes in the market, which are beyond the control of the company, may have an impact on future calculations of estimated fair value.
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill, additional steps, including an allocation of the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, would be necessary to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment.
indefinite-lived intangible assets the company conducts testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or when impairment indicators arise, whichever comes first. the company conducted annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing as of july 1. in fourth quarter 2015, the annual impairment testing date was changed to october 1. this change is in response to a change in the timing of the corporate forecasting process as the forecast is a key input to the annual impairment testing process.
the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is considered to be impaired when the fair value, as established by appraisal or based on discounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than the respective carrying value.
79
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of various tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. the company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, to test indefinite-lived intangible assets. the estimated fair value of the tradenames is determined based on an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium. the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired when the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the tradename.
investments the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all its subsidiaries and entities/joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained.
investments in affiliates over which the company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis. under the equity method of accounting, these investments are included in other noncurrent assets. the company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in other (income)
charges, net, and its share of other comprehensive income (loss) in the appropriate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.
pension and other postretirement benefits the company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits.
additionally, eastman provides a subsidy toward life insurance, health care, and dental benefits for eligible retirees and a subsidy toward health care and dental benefits for retirees' eligible survivors. the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company's assumptions related to general economic conditions
(particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase or decrease for employees, and health care cost trends. the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation.
eastman's pension and other postretirement benefit plans costs consist of two elements: 1) ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service credits; and 2) mark-to-market ("mtm") gains and losses recognized annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets. any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement, or significant plan changes are recognized as an mtm adjustment in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs.
for additional information, see note 11 , " retirement plans ".
environmental costs the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the company accrues the minimum amount. this undiscounted accrued amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid out within 30 years and the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.
80
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company also establishes reserves for closure and post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and surface impoundments. when these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. the asset retirement obligations are recognized in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. these expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. currently, the company estimates the useful life of each individual asset up to 50 years . if the company changes its estimate of the environmental asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, the expenses charged into earnings could increase or decrease. the company also monitors conditional obligations and recognizes contingent liabilities associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs.
the current portion of accruals for environmental liabilities is included in payables and other current liabilities with the long-term portion included in other long-term liabilities. these accruals exclude claims for recoveries from insurance companies or other third parties. environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, and/or mitigate or prevent future contamination. the cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to expense as incurred.
for additional information see note 13 , " environmental matters and asset retirement obligations ".
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are used by the company when appropriate to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain contract sales prices, raw material and energy costs, and interest rates. these instruments are used to mitigate the risk that changes in exchange rates, sales prices, raw material and energy costs, or interest rates will adversely affect the eventual dollar cash flows resulting from the hedged transactions.
from time to time, the company enters into currency option and forward contracts to hedge anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies (principally the euro and the japanese yen); and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. to mitigate fluctuations in the market prices of commodities and their effects on the cash costs of the underlying transactions expected over the next five years for propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, and benzene (certain raw materials and energy used in the manufacturing process)
and selling prices for ethylene, the company may enter into option and forward contracts. from time to time, the company also utilizes interest rate derivative instruments, primarily forward starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, to hedge the company's exposure to movements in interest rates.
the company's qualifying option and forward contracts are accounted for as hedges because the derivative instruments are designated and demonstrated to be effective as hedges of the underlying risks. gains and losses resulting from effective hedges of existing liabilities, firm commitments, or anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized when the offsetting gains and losses are recognized on the related hedged items and are reported as a component of operating earnings. derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value.
the gains or losses on nonqualifying derivatives or derivatives that are not designated as hedges are marked to market and immediately recorded into earnings from continuing operations.
deferred option premiums are included in the fair market value of the hedges. the related obligation for payment is generally included in other liabilities and is paid in the period in which the options are exercised or expire.
for additional information see note 10 , " derivatives ".
81
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements litigation and contingent liabilities the company and its operations from time to time are, and in the future may be, parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. the company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the company accrues the minimum amount. the company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.
revenue recognition and customer incentives the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
revenue for products is recognized when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer.
the company records estimated obligations for customer programs and incentive offerings, which consist primarily of revenue or volume-based amounts that a customer must achieve over a specified period of time, as a reduction of revenue from each underlying revenue transaction as the customer progresses toward goals specified in incentive agreements. these estimates are based on a combination of forecasts of customer sales and actual sales volume and revenues against established goals, the customer's current level of purchases, eastman's knowledge of customer purchasing habits, and industry pricing practice. the incentive payment rate may be variable, based upon the customer reaching higher sales volume or revenue levels over a specified period of time in order to receive an agreed upon incentive payment.
shipping and handling fees and costs shipping and handling fees related to sales transactions are billed to customers and are recorded as sales revenue.
shipping and handling costs incurred are recorded in cost of sales.
restructuring of operations the company records restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation of operations, exited business or product lines, or shutdowns of specific sites that are expected to be substantially completed within twelve months. these restructuring charges are recorded as incurred, and are associated with site closures, legal and environmental matters, demolition, contract terminations, obsolete inventory, or other costs directly related to the restructuring. the company records severance charges for employee separations when the separation is probable and reasonably estimable. in the event employees are required to perform future service, the company records severance charges ratably over the remaining service period of those employees.
share-based compensation the company recognizes compensation expense in the financial statements for stock options and other share-based compensation awards based upon the grant-date fair value over the substantive vesting period.
for additional information, see note 18 , " share-based compensation plans and awards ".
research and development all costs identified as research and development ("r&d") costs are charged to expense when incurred with the exception of third-party reimbursed and government-funded r&d. expenses for third-party reimbursed and government-
funded r&d are deferred until reimbursement is received to ensure appropriate matching of revenue and expense, provided specific criteria are met.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements income taxes the provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.
the company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision.
accounting standard asu 2015-17, income taxes (topic 740), effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, requires the presentation of deferred income taxes such that deferred tax liabilities and assets are to be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. at december 31, 2015, the prospective adoption resulted in a reclassification from current to noncurrent deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of $240
million and $12 million , respectively.
purchase accounting in general, the acquisition method of accounting requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. for assets and liabilities other than intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, the company estimates fair value using the exit price approach which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of unrelated market participants as a whole, in the principal or most advantageous market, and may result in the company valuing assets or liabilities at a fair value that is not reflective of the company's intended use of the assets or liabilities. any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired or liabilities assumed is recorded in the line item goodwill on the company's consolidated balance sheets.
for intangible assets, the company uses the income, market, or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate, and uses valuation inputs in these models and analyses that are based on market participant assumptions. management values property, plant, and equipment using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data which includes consideration of obsolescence. see note 2 , " acquisitions ".
management's judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives for property, plant, and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, and can materially affect the company's results of operations.
2.  acquisitions taminco corporation on december 5, 2014, the company completed its acquisition of the taminco corporation ("taminco"), a global specialty chemical company. in the acquisition, each outstanding share of taminco common stock was cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive $26.00 in cash ("acquisition consideration"). additionally, each outstanding option to acquire shares of taminco common stock issued under any of taminco's equity incentive plans, whether or not then vested, was converted into the right to receive, in cash and for each share of taminco common stock subject to such option, the amount by which the value of the acquisition consideration exceeded such option's exercise price. the fair value of total consideration transferred was $2.8 billion , consisting of cash of $1.7
billion , net of cash acquired, and repayment of taminco's debt of $1.1 billion . the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. taminco's former specialty amines and crop protection businesses are now operated as part of the additives & functional products ("afp") segment and its former functional amines business is now operated as part of the specialty fluids & intermediates ("sfi") segment. the businesses acquired from taminco are providing additional opportunities for growth to eastman in agriculture, personal care, coatings, and oil and gas markets.
83
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the funding of the cash portion of the purchase price, repayment of taminco's debt, and acquisition costs were provided primarily from borrowings, including the $2.0 billion net proceeds from the public offering of notes on november 20, 2014 and borrowings of $1.0 billion on december 5, 2014 under a five-year term loan agreement (the
"term loan agreement"). see note 9 , " borrowings ".

acquired the company used the income, market, or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate, and used valuation inputs in these models and analyses that were based on market participant assumptions. market participants are considered to be buyers and sellers unrelated to eastman in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. for certain items, the carrying value was determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on information available to eastman management. current assets consist primarily of inventory, cash, and trade receivables. the fair value and gross contractual amounts trade receivables acquired from taminco on december 5, 2014 was $94 million . properties acquired included a number of manufacturing, sales, and distribution sites and related facilities, land and leased sites that include leasehold improvements, and machinery and equipment for use in manufacturing operations. management valued properties using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data which includes consideration of obsolescence.
acquired intangible assets are definite-lived assets and consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technologies, and contracts. customer relationships acquired are in industries such as agriculture and personal care. the company has concluded that it has a favorable methanol supply contract. in addition, assets acquired include technologies related to many products protected by a number of existing patents and trade secrets.
management valued customer relationships using the excess from earnings method, contracts using the black scholes model, and developed technologies using the relief from royalty method. all valuation methods are forms of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer chemical companies.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements other noncurrent assets consist primarily of deferred tax assets and investments. in connection with the acquisition, the company recorded goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. the goodwill is attributed primarily to taminco as a going concern and the fair value of expected cost synergies and revenue growth from combining the eastman and taminco businesses. the going concern element represents the ability to earn a higher return on the combined assembled collection of assets and businesses of taminco than if those assets and businesses were to be acquired and managed separately. other relevant elements of goodwill are the benefits of access to certain markets and work force. goodwill from the taminco acquisition has been allocated to certain of the company's reportable segments as set out in the table below. none of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

the effective tax rate was 24 percent for both 2015 and 2014. the 2015 effective tax rate reflected a benefit from both the u.s. federal tax manufacturing deduction, due to an increase in domestic taxable income, and increased u.s. federal tax credits compared to 2014. this was offset by a reduction in the foreign rate variance as a result of an unfavorable shift in foreign income to higher tax jurisdictions and limited benefit from the asset impairment of the workington, uk acetate tow manufacturing facility. both years reflect a benefit from the extension of favorable u.s. federal tax provisions, which resulted in a net benefit of approximately $15 million primarily related to research and development credits and deferral of certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries from u.s.
income taxes.
the 2014 effective tax rate of 24 percent reflected incremental benefit of approximately 6 percent over the 2013
effective tax rate of 30 percent . the primary items benefiting the company's effective tax rate were the impact of the annual pension and other postretirement benefit mtm accounting and incremental foreign rate benefit from the integration of the solutia acquisition. the company recognized a mtm loss of $304 million in 2014 and a mtm gain of
$383 million in 2013, which were primarily recognized in u.s. legal entities. the $687 million reduction in u.s.
earnings accounted for an approximately 5 percent benefit to the 2014 effective tax rate compared to 2013. the 2014
effective tax rate also benefited 3 percent compared to 2013 due to an incremental $50 million foreign rate variance. the incremental benefit was the result of the company's integration of eastman and solutia business operations and legal entity structures, including relocating certain of the company's global business headquarters, which are primarily international, to europe to better serve customers, and implementing an integrated entity financing structure allowing more efficient redeployment of cash for subsidiaries outside the u.s. these 2014
incremental benefits over 2013 were partially offset by a 2013 $14 million tax benefit primarily due to adjustments to the tax provision to reflect the finalization of the 2012 consolidated u.s. federal income tax return and a 2013
$14 million benefit for the finalization of foreign tax audits.

unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the united states, considered to be reinvested indefinitely, totaled approximately $1.9 billion at december 31, 2015 . it is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to those unremitted earnings.
for certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, income and losses directly flow through to taxable income in the united states. these entities are also subject to taxation in the foreign tax jurisdictions. net operating loss carryforwards exist to offset future taxable income in foreign tax jurisdictions and valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred related tax assets if it is more likely than not that this benefit will not be realized. changes in the estimated realizable amount of deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses for these entities could result in changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the foreign tax jurisdiction. at the same time, because these entities are also subject to tax in the united states, a deferred tax liability for the expected future taxable income will be established concurrently. therefore, the impact of any reversal of valuation allowances on consolidated income tax expense will be only to the extent that there are differences between the united states statutory tax rate and the tax rate in the foreign jurisdiction. a valuation allowance of $23 million at december 31, 2015 , has been provided against the deferred tax asset resulting from these operating loss carryforwards.
at december 31, 2015 , foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaled $779 million . of this total, $86 million will expire in 3 to 20 years and $693 million have no expiration date. a valuation allowance of approximately $171
million has been provided against such net operating loss carryforwards.
at december 31, 2015 , federal net operating loss carryforwards of $243 million were available to offset future taxable income, which expire from 2025 to 2030. at december 31, 2015 , foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $180 million were available to reduce possible future u.s. income taxes and which expire from 2017 to
2021.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements a partial valuation allowance of $55 million has been provided for solutia's state net operating loss carryforwards. the valuation allowance will be retained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized or the related statute expires. a full valuation allowance of $50 million had been provided against the u.s. deferred tax assets for solutia's capital loss carryforward, which expired in 2015.
as a result of the solutia acquisition transaction, solutia realized a change of ownership for purposes of section
382 of the internal revenue code. management does not currently expect this change to significantly limit the company's ability to utilize solutia's u.s. net operating loss or foreign tax credit carryforwards estimated to be approximately $219 million and $180 million , respectively, at december 31, 2015 .

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company files income tax returns in the united states and various state and foreign jurisdictions. the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011 and 2002 for eastman and solutia, respectively. with few exceptions, eastman is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010. solutia, inc. and related subsidiaries are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for years before 2000. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2007.
it is reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, as a result of the resolution of federal, state, and foreign examinations and appeals, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by a range of $0 to $10 million .

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements credit facility and commercial paper borrowings in connection with the acquisition of taminco, eastman entered into a $1.0 billion five-year term loan agreement.
as of december 31, 2015 , the term loan agreement balance outstanding was $350 million with an interest rate of
1.67 percent . in 2015, $650 million of the term loan agreement balance was repaid using available cash and other borrowings. as of december 31, 2014, the term loan agreement balance outstanding was $1.0 billion with an interest rate of 1.41 percent . borrowings under the term loan agreement are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates.
the company has access to a $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement (the "credit facility") that was amended in october 2015 to extend the maturity to october 2020. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. the credit facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes.
accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce capacity for borrowings available under the credit facility. beginning in fourth quarter 2015 , commercial paper borrowings were classified as short-term. at december
31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, the company had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. at december
31, 2015 , the company's commercial paper borrowings were $430 million with a weighted average interest rate of
0.80 percent . at december 31, 2014, the company's commercial paper borrowings were $235 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.47 percent .
in july 2015, the company amended its $250 million accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "a/r facility") to extend the maturity to april 2018 . borrowings under the a/r facility are subject to interest rates based on a spread over the lender's borrowing costs, and the company pays a fee to maintain availability of the a/r facility. at december 31, 2015 , the company's borrowings under the a/r facility were $200 million supported by trade receivables with an interest rate of 1.11 percent . in 2015, $ 50 million of the company's borrowings under the a/r facility were repaid using available cash. at december 31, 2014 , the company had no outstanding borrowings under the a/r facility.
the term loan agreement, credit facility, and the a/r facility contain a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. the company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. total available borrowings under the credit facility and a/r facility were
$842 million and $1,265 million as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. changes in available borrowings were due primarily to increases in commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under the a/r facility.
the company would not have violated applicable covenants for these periods if the total available amounts of the facilities had been borrowed.
fair value of borrowings the company has classified its long-term borrowings at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 under the fair value hierarchy as defined in the accounting policies in note 1 , " significant accounting policies ". the fair value for fixed-rate borrowings is based on current market prices and is classified in level 1. the fair value for the company's floating-rate borrowings, which relate to the term loan agreement, the a/r facility, and capital leases, equals the carrying value and is classified within level 2.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
10.  derivatives hedging programs the company is exposed to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. to mitigate these market risks and their effects on the cash flows of the underlying transaction, the company uses various derivative financial instruments when appropriate in accordance with the company's hedging strategy and policies. designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
the company hedges commodity price risks using derivative financial instruments over a maximum of five years beyond its current fiscal year. the company weights its hedge portfolio more heavily in the first year with declining coverage over the remaining periods.
fair value hedges fair value hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk. for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. in 2015, the company unwound the notional amount of $275 million associated with the interest rate swaps on the 3.6% notes due 2022. as of december 31, 2015, there are no outstanding interest rate swap hedges. as of december 31, 2014, the total notional amount of the company's interest rate swaps was $275 million.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements foreign currency exchange rate hedging the company manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. to manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets. to manage the remaining exposure, the company enters into currency options and forwards from time to time to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within no longer than five years and denominated in foreign currencies (principally the euro and japanese yen) and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. the mtm gains or losses on qualifying hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent effective, and reclassified into sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
commodity hedging certain raw material and energy sources used by the company, as well as sales of certain commodity products by the company, are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply and demand conditions, economic variables and other unpredictable factors. these commodity and energy costs are primarily related to propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, ethylene, and benzene. from time to time to mitigate expected fluctuations in market prices, the company enters into option and forward contracts. these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. the mtm gains or losses on qualifying hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales (for commodity purchases) and sales (for commodity sales) in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
interest rate hedging the company's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. to manage this mix effectively, the company from time to time enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. these swaps are designated as hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt obligations and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps. as these instruments are 100 percent effective, there is no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
from time to time, the company also utilizes interest rate derivative instruments, primarily forward starting swaps and treasury locks, to hedge the company's exposure to movements in interest rates prior to anticipated debt offerings. these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and are typically 100 percent effective. as a result, there is no current impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
the mtm gains or losses on these hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent effective, and are reclassified into interest expense over the term of the related debt instruments.

the majority of the company's derivative assets are classified as level 2. level 2 fair value is based on estimates using standard pricing models. these standard pricing models use inputs which are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. the fair value of commodity contracts is derived using forward curves supplied by an industry recognized and unrelated third party.
in addition, on an ongoing basis, the company tests a subset of its valuations against valuations received from the transaction's counterparty to validate the accuracy of its standard pricing models. counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance.
from time to time, the company holds level 3 assets for commodity hedges. the fair values of level 3 instruments are determined using pricing data similar to that used in level 2 financial instruments described above, and reflect adjustments for less liquid markets or longer contractual terms. level 3 hedges typically will mature within one year or less. the company determines the fair value of level 3 ethylene derivative forward contracts using an average of unadjusted forward ethylene prices provided by industry recognized experts to value its ethylene positions.

11.  retirement plans as described in more detail below, eastman offers various postretirement benefits to its employees.
defined contribution plans the company sponsors a defined contribution employee stock ownership plan (the "esop"), which is a component of the eastman investment plan and employee stock ownership plan ("eip/esop"), a plan under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code. eastman made a contribution in february 2016 to the eip/esop for substantially all u.s. employees equal to 5 percent of their eligible compensation for the 2015 plan year. employees may allocate contributions to other investment funds within the eip from the esop at any time without restrictions. allocated shares in the esop totaled 2,199,000 ; 2,197,740 ; and 2,289,618 shares as of december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
dividends on shares held by the eip/esop are charged to retained earnings. all shares held by the eip/esop are treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share.
in 2006, the company amended its eip/esop to provide a company match of 50 percent of the first 7 percent of an employee's compensation contributed to the plan for employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007. employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007, are also eligible for the contribution to the esop as described above.
charges for domestic contributions to the eip/esop were $62 million , $56 million , and $43 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans pension plans eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits.
102
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements effective january 1, 2000, the company's eastman retirement assistance plan, a u.s. defined benefit pension plan, was amended. employees' accrued pension benefits earned prior to january 1, 2000 are calculated based on previous plan provisions using the employee's age, years of service, and final average compensation as defined in the plans.
the amended plan uses a pension equity formula to calculate an employee's retirement benefits from january 1, 2000
forward. benefits payable will be the combined pre-2000 and post-1999 benefits. employees hired on or after january
1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in eastman's u.s. defined benefit pension plans.
in december 2014, as part of its acquisition of taminco, the company assumed taminco's non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans in belgium and finland. for more information on this acquisition, see note 2 , " acquisitions ".
benefits are paid to employees from trust funds. contributions to the trust funds are made as permitted by laws and regulations. the pension trust funds do not directly own any of the company's common stock.
pension coverage for employees of eastman's non-u.s. operations is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. the company systematically provides for obligations under such plans by depositing funds with trustees, under insurance policies, or by book reserves.
other postretirement benefit plans under its other postretirement benefit plans, eastman provides a subsidy for life insurance, health care, and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007, and a subsidy for health care and dental benefits to retirees' eligible survivors. in general, eastman provides those benefits to retirees eligible under the company's u.s. plans. similar benefits are also made available to retirees of holston defense corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company that, prior to january 1, 1999, operated a government-owned ammunition plant.
employees in the u.s. hired on or after january 1, 2007 do not have access to postretirement health care benefits.
a few of the company's non-u.s. operations have supplemental health benefit plans for certain retirees, the cost of which is not significant to the company.
in december 2014, as part of its acquisition of taminco, the company assumed taminco's u.s. postretirement benefit plan. for more information on this acquisition, see note 2 , " acquisitions ".

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in fourth quarter 2015, the company changed benefits provided to retirees by the eastman other postretirement benefit plan which triggered a remeasurement of the plan's obligation. the remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $140 million which will be amortized as a prior service credit from accumulated other comprehensive income over approximately 8 years. the remeasurement was included in the 2015 year end remeasurement process.
in third quarter 2013, the company changed benefits provided to future retirees by the eastman other postretirement benefit plan which triggered an interim remeasurement of the plan's obligation. the remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $47 million which will be amortized as a prior service credit from accumulated other comprehensive income over 8 years. the remeasurement of the plan also resulted in a mark-to-market actuarial gain of $86 million in third quarter 2013. the actuarial gain was primarily due to a higher assumed discount rate of 4.72 percent in third quarter 2013 compared to 4.01 percent at december 31, 2012. the higher assumed discount rate is reflective of changes in global market conditions and interest rates on high-grade corporate bonds.
the estimated prior service credit for the u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic cost in 2016 is $4 million and $41 million , respectively.
the assumptions used to develop the projected benefit obligation for the company's significant u.s. and non-u.s.
defined benefit pension plans and u.s. postretirement benefit plans are provided in the following tables.

a seven and one-half percent rate of increase in per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed for
2016. the rate is assumed to decrease gradually to five percent in 2021 and remain at that level thereafter. a one percent increase or decrease in health care cost trend would have had no material impact on the 2015 service and interest costs or the 2015 benefit obligation, because the company's contributions for benefits are fixed.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company performed a five year experience study on assumptions for the u.s. plans in 2014 which included a review of the mortality tables. as a result of the study, the company continues to use the rp-2000 table with scale aa static improvement scale and no collar adjustment as it most closely aligns with the company's experience.
the fair value of plan assets for the u.s. pension plans at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was $1.9 billion and $2.0
billion , respectively, while the fair value of plan assets at december 31, 2015 and 2014 for non-u.s. pension plans was $650 million and $699 million , respectively. at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , the expected weighted-
average long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.60% percent and 7.78% percent, respectively. the expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on non-u.s. pension plans assets was 5.11% percent and 5.50%
percent at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company's investment strategy for its defined benefit pension plans is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to meet or exceed the plan's actuarially assumed long-
term rate of return and to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. a periodic asset/liability study is conducted in order to assist in the determination and, if necessary, modification of the appropriate long-term investment policy for the plan. the investment policy establishes a target allocation range for each asset class and the fund is managed within those ranges. the plans use a number of investment approaches including investments in equity, real estate, and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable in order to achieve this target allocation. the plans also invest in private equity and other funds. diversification is created through investment across various asset classes, geographies, fund managers, and individual securities. this investment process is designed to provide for a well-diversified portfolio with no significant concentration of risk. the investment process is monitored by an investment committee comprised of various senior executives from within eastman.
in december 2014, as part of its acquisition of taminco, the company assumed taminco's non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans in belgium and finland. the pension plans' assets consist of guaranteed investment contracts with an insurance company. the company also assumed taminco's u.s. postretirement benefit plan which has no plan assets.
in july 2012, as part of its acquisition of solutia, the company assumed solutia's defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the solutia defined benefit pension plans adhere to the company's defined benefit plan investment strategy. the solutia defined benefit pension plans also utilize a dynamic de-risking strategy to shift from growth assets to liability matching assets as the plan's funded status improves. the investment strategy with respect to solutia's other postretirement benefits plan is to invest in an intermediate-
term, well diversified, high quality investment instruments, with a primary objective of capital preservation.
the expected rate of return for all plans was determined primarily by modeling the expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments held by the plans and the targeted allocation percentage against various potential economic scenarios.
the company funded its u.s. defined benefit pension plans in the amount of $125 million in 2015 and $120 million in
2014. for 2016, there are no minimum required cash contributions for the u.s. defined benefit pension plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, and the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.
the estimated future benefit payments, reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:

guarantees the company has operating leases with terms that require the company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease as well as other guarantees. disclosures about each group of similar guarantees are provided below.
residual value guarantees the company has operating leases with terms that require the company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease. these residual value guarantees at december 31, 2015 totaled
$120 million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars and company aircraft and will expire beginning in 2016.
management believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood of material residual guarantee payments is remote.
other guarantees guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, and other parties when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur. non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company. the company's current other guarantees include guarantees relating primarily to intellectual property, environmental matters, and other indemnifications and have arisen through the normal course of business. the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims, if they were to occur. these other guarantees have terms up to 30 years with maximum potential future payments of approximately $35 million in the aggregate, with none of these guarantees being individually significant to the company's operating results, financial position, or liquidity. the company's current expectation is that future payment or performance related to non-performance under other guarantees is considered remote.

13.  environmental matters and asset retirement obligations certain eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies. in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("prp") by the u.s. environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. in addition, the company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and post-closure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act. reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with eastman's policies described in note 1 , "
significant accounting policies ". the company's total reserve for environmental contingencies was $336 million and
$345 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , this reserve included $8
million and $10 million , respectively, related to sites previously closed and impaired by eastman and sites that have been divested by eastman but for which the company retains the environmental liability related to these sites.
the company's total environmental reserve for environmental contingencies, including remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, is reflected in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows:

remediation estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs ranged from the undiscounted minimum or best estimate of $308 million to the maximum of $516 million and from the minimum or best estimate of $324 million to the maximum of $548 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. the maximum estimated future costs are considered to be reasonably possible and include the amounts accrued at both december 31, 2015 and 2014 .
costs of certain remediation projects included in the environmental reserve are subject to a cost-sharing arrangement with monsanto company ("monsanto") under the provisions of the amended and restated settlement agreement effective february 28, 2008 (the "effective date"), into which solutia entered with monsanto upon its emergence from bankruptcy (the "monsanto settlement agreement"). under the provisions of the monsanto settlement agreement, the company shares responsibility with monsanto for remediation at certain locations outside of the boundaries of plant sites in anniston, alabama and sauget, illinois (the "shared sites"). the company is responsible for the funding of environmental liabilities at the shared sites up to a total of $325 million from the effective date. if remediation costs for the shared sites exceed this amount, such costs will thereafter be shared equally between the company and monsanto. including payments by solutia prior to its acquisition by eastman, $71
million had been paid for costs at the shared sites as of december 31, 2015 . as of december 31, 2015 , an additional $205 million has been accrued for estimated future remediation costs at the shared sites, over a period of thirty years .
reserves for environmental remediation that management believes to be probable and estimable are recognized as current and long-term liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. the amounts charged to pre-
tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are included in cost of sales and other (income)
charges, net, and are summarized below:

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements closure/post-closure an asset retirement obligation is an obligation for the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. the company recognizes a sset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. the associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful life. environmental asset retirement obligations consist of primarily closure and post-closure costs. for facilities that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate accrued to date over the facilities' estimated useful lives for these asset retirement obligation costs were $28 million and $21 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
other environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, and/or mitigate or prevent future contamination. the cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to expense as incurred. the amounts charged to earnings related to environmental protection and improvement were $290 million , $319 million , and $285 million in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. these amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, but also included
$61 million and $79 million in expenditures for engineering and construction in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the company also has contractual obligations that include asset retirement obligations not associated with environmental liabilities. eastman's non-environmental asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the future closure of leased manufacturing assets at pace, florida and oulu, finland acquired from taminco. these accrued non-environmental asset retirement obligations were $46 million and $ 44 million as of december 31, 2015
and december 31, 2014, respectively.
14.  legal matters general from time to time, the company and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. while the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company established a benefit security trust in 1997 to provide a degree of financial security for unfunded obligations under certain unfunded plans and contributed to the trust a warrant to purchase up to 6 million shares of common stock of the company for par value. the warrant, which remains outstanding, is exercisable by the trustee if the company does not meet certain funding obligations, which obligations would be triggered by certain occurrences, including a change in control or potential change in control, as defined, or failure by the company to meet its payment obligations under certain covered unfunded plans. such warrant is excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the conditions upon which the warrant becomes exercisable have not been met.
the additions to paid-in capital in 2015, 2014, and 2013 are primarily for compensation expense of equity awards and employee stock option exercises.
in february 2011, the company's board of directors authorized repurchase of up to $300 million of the company's outstanding common stock. the company completed the $300 million repurchase authorization in august 2013, acquiring a total of 6,141,999 shares. in may 2013, the company's board of directors authorized repurchase of up to $300
million of the company's outstanding common stock. the company completed the $300 million repurchase authorization in march 2014, acquiring a total of 3,840,949 shares. in february 2014, the company's board of directors authorized repurchase of up to an additional $1 billion of the company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the company. as of december 31, 2015, a total of 4,410,689 shares have been repurchased under this authorization for a total of $353 million . during 2015, the company repurchased 1,477,660 shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $103 million . during 2014, the company repurchased 4,945,452 shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $410 million . during 2013, the company repurchased 3,212,886 shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $238 million .
the company's charitable foundation held 50,798 shares of the company's common stock at december 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 which are included in treasury stock.

as a result of the annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, in third quarter 2014 the company recognized an intangible asset impairment of $22 million in the afp segment to adjust the carrying value of the crystex ® tradename to the estimated fair value. this impairment resulted from a decrease in projected revenue since the tradename was acquired as part of the 2012 solutia acquisition. the estimated fair value was determined using an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in addition, during 2014, a change in estimate of certain costs for the fourth quarter 2012 termination of the operating agreement for the são jose dos campos, brazil site resulted in a restructuring charge of $5 million to previously recognized asset impairments and restructuring charges.

18.  share-based compensation plans and awards
2012 omnibus stock compensation plan eastman's 2012 omnibus stock compensation plan ("2012 omnibus plan") was approved by stockholders at the may 3,
2012 annual meeting of stockholders and shall remain in effect until its fifth anniversary. the 2012 omnibus plan authorizes the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors to: grant awards, designate participants, determine the types and numbers of awards, determine the terms and conditions of awards and determine the form of award settlement. under the 2012 omnibus plan, the aggregate number of shares reserved and available for issuance is 10 million , which consist of shares not previously authorized for issuance under any other plan. the number of shares covered by an award is counted against this share reserve as of the grant date of the award. shares covered by full value awards (e.g. performance shares and restricted stock awards) are counted against the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under the plan as 2.5 shares for every one share covered by the award. any stock distributed pursuant to an award may consist of, in whole or in part, authorized and unissued stock, treasury stock, or stock purchased on the open market. under the 2012 omnibus plan and previous plans, the forms of awards have included: restricted stock and restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights ("sars"), and performance shares. the 2012 omnibus plan is flexible as to the number of specific forms of awards, but provides that stock options and sars are to be granted at an exercise price not less than 100 percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the grant .
director stock compensation subplan eastman's 2015 director stock compensation subplan ("directors' subplan"), a component of the 2012 omnibus plan, remains in effect until terminated by the board of directors or the earlier termination of the 2012 omnibus plan.
the directors' subplan provides for structured awards of restricted shares to non-employee members of the board of directors. restricted shares awarded under the directors' subplan are subject to the same terms and conditions of the 2012 omnibus plan. the directors' subplan does not constitute a separate source of shares for grant of equity awards and all shares awarded are part of the 10 million shares authorized under the 2012 omnibus plan. shares of restricted stock are granted on the first day of a non-employee director's initial term of service and shares of restricted stock are granted each year to each non-employee director on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders.
120
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements general the company is authorized by the board of directors under the 2012 omnibus plan to provide grants to employees and non-employee members of the board of directors. it has been the company's practice to issue new shares rather than treasury shares for equity awards that require settlement by the issuance of common stock and to withhold or accept back shares awarded to cover the related income tax obligations of employee participants. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by non-employee directors are not eligible to be withheld or acquired to satisfy the withholding obligation related to their income taxes. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by specified senior management level employees are accepted by the company to pay the exercise price of stock options in accordance with the terms and conditions of their awards.
for 2015, 2014, and 2013, total share-based compensation expense (before tax) of approximately $36 million , $28
million , and $40 million , respectively, was recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for all share-based awards of which approximately $7 million , $4 million , and
$5 million , respectively, related to stock options. the compensation expense is recognized over the substantive vesting period, which may be a shorter time period than the stated vesting period for qualifying termination eligible employees as defined in the forms of award notice. for 2015, 2014, and 2013, approximately $2 million , $1
million , and $3 million , respectively, of stock option compensation expense was recognized due to qualifying termination eligibility preceding the requisite vesting period.
stock option awards options have been granted on an annual basis to non-employee directors under the directors' subplan and predecessor plans and by the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors under the 2012 omnibus plan and predecessor plans to employees. option awards have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's stock on the date of grant. the term of options is 10 years with vesting periods that vary up to three years. vesting usually occurs ratably over the vesting period or at the end of the vesting period. the company utilizes the black scholes merton option valuation model which relies on certain assumptions to estimate an option's fair value.
the weighted average assumptions used in the determination of fair value for stock options awarded in 2015, 2014, and 2013 are provided in the table below.
assumptions                          2015      2014      2013
expected volatility rate           24.11%    25.82%    34.90%
expected dividend yield             1.75%     1.70%     1.97%
average risk-free interest rate     1.45%     1.44%     0.77%
expected forfeiture rate            0.75%     0.75%     0.75%
expected term years                   4.8       4.7       5.0
the volatility rate of grants is derived from historical company common stock price volatility over the same time period as the expected term of each stock option award. the volatility rate is derived by mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high closing stock price data over the expected term.
the expected dividend yield is calculated using the company's average of the last four quarterly dividend yields .
the average risk-free interest rate is derived from united states department of treasury published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period as the expected term.
gaap specifies only share-based awards expected to vest be included in share-based compensation expense. estimated forfeiture rates are determined using historical forfeiture experience for each type of award and are excluded from the quantity of awards included in share-based compensation expense.
the weighted average expected term reflects the analysis of historical share-based award transactions and includes option swap and reload grants which may have much shorter remaining expected terms than new option grants.

other share-based compensation awards in addition to stock option awards, the company has awarded long-term performance share awards, restricted stock awards, and sars. the long-term performance share awards are based upon actual return on capital compared to a target return on capital and total stockholder return compared to a peer group ranking by total stockholder return over a three year performance period. the awards are valued using a monte carlo simulation based model and vest pro-rata over the three year performance period. the number of long-term performance award target shares granted for the 2015-2017, 2014-2016, and 2013-2015 periods were 347 thousand , 285 thousand , and 270 thousand , respectively. the target shares granted are assumed to be 100 percent. at the end of the three-year performance period, the actual number of shares awarded can range from zero percent to 250 percent of the target shares granted based on the award notice. the number of restricted stock awards granted during 2015, 2014, and 2013 were 233
thousand , 144 thousand , and 146 thousand , respectively. the fair value of a restricted stock award is equal to the closing stock price of the company's stock on the date of grant and normally vests over a period of three years. the recognized compensation expense before tax for these other share-based awards in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was approximately $29 million , $24 million , and $35 million , respectively. the unrecognized compensation expense before tax for these same type awards at december 31, 2015 was approximately $40
million and will be recognized primarily over a period of two years.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
23.  recently issued accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") and international accounting standards board jointly issued new principles-based accounting guidance for revenue recognition that will supersede virtually all existing revenue guidance. the core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. to achieve the core principle, the guidance establishes the following five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligation in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. the guidance also details the accounting treatment for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. lastly, disclosure requirements have been enhanced to provide sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. in august 2015, the fasb issued new guidance to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. the deferral results in the new revenue standard being effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017. early application is permitted under the original effective date of fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2016. the company is currently evaluating the impact on the company's financial position and results of operations and related disclosures.
in april 2015, the fasb issued new guidance for debt issuance costs as a part of the simplification and productivity initiative. under this guidance debt issuance costs will be presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. the amortization of debt issuance costs will be reported as interest expense. the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected by the amendment. in august 2015, the fasb released clarifying guidance for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements which may be deferred and for presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. the new guidance is to be applied on a retrospective basis and reported as a change in an accounting principle. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. the company has concluded that changes in its accounting required by this new guidance will not materially impact the company's financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.
in april 2015, the fasb issued new guidance for cloud computing arrangement fees, also as a part of the simplification and productivity initiative. the guidance establishes a new requirement to determine if cloud computing arrangements include a software license. if an arrangement is deemed to include a software license then the customer would account for the license as any other purchased software, capitalized and depreciated over the life of the contract. if an arrangement is deemed not to include a license, the agreement would be accounted for as a service contract. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted. the company has concluded that changes in its accounting required by this new guidance will not materially impact the company's financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.
in july 2015, the fasb issued new guidance to simplify the measurement of inventory under the simplification and productivity initiative. the final standard changes the subsequent inventory measurement from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value ("nrv"). nrv is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. the subsequent method of estimating the cost of inventory under gaap (i.e., lifo or fifo) is not being changed. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted. the new guidance is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. the company has concluded that changes in its accounting required by this new guidance will not materially impact the company's financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in september 2015, the fasb issued guidance under the simplification and productivity initiative for business combination accounting. the new guidance requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. under this guidance the acquirer recognizes, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. new disclosures are required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recognized in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recognized in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. at adoption, the new guidance is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. the company has elected to early adopt the new guidance beginning in third quarter 2015 for acquisitions in which the initial purchase price allocation was incomplete. at december 31, 2015, there have been no material changes or effect on earnings for any acquisitions as disclosed in note 2, acquisitions.
in november 2015, the fasb issued guidance under the simplification and productivity initiative for presentation of deferred income tax liabilities and assets. this guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes such that deferred tax liabilities and assets are to be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. the update does not amend the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period and may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. the company has elected to early adopt, prospectively, the new guidance as of the balance sheet date. at december 31, 2015, the adoption resulted in a reclassification from current to noncurrent deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of $240
million and $12 million , respectively. prior periods are not retrospectively adjusted under the prospective adoption.

item 9.  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none.
item 9a.  controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures eastman chemical company ("eastman" or the "company") maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including the chief executive officer
("ceo") and chief financial officer ("cfo"), of the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures. based on that evaluation, the ceo and cfo have concluded that as of december 31, 2015 , the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed was accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives.
management, including the ceo and cfo, does not expect that the company's disclosure controls and procedures can prevent all possible errors or fraud. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance; judgments in decision-making can be faulty; and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of one or more persons. the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and while the company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to possible errors or fraud may occur and not be detected.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the company's ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
the company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:
•  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and acquisitions and dispositions of assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
•  statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the company; and
•  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the company's financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
132
management has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015
based on the framework established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso"). based on this assessment, management has determined that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2015 .
the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there has been no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially effect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company's substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.
more than half of the company's sales for 2015 were to customers outside of north america. the company expects sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of the company's sales. also, a significant portion of manufacturing capacity is located outside of the united states. accordingly, the company's business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in u.s. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. in addition, foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax eastman's foreign income, or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls.
certain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with eastman's global scope. for example, it may be more difficult for eastman to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems. there is a risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where eastman operates. social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with eastman's corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where eastman operates are a risk to the company's financial performance. as eastman continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse effect on eastman's business, financial condition or results of operations.
legislative or regulatory actions could increase the company's future compliance costs.
the company and its facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. the company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. for example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. specifically, pending and proposed u.s. federal legislation and regulation increase the likelihood that the company's manufacturing sites will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy, which legislation and regulation, if enacted, may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs.
in addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. the foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. this disclosure, including that under "outlook"
and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the company in this annual report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. the company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. investors are advised, however, to consult any further public company disclosures (such as in filings with the securities and exchange commission or in company press releases) on related subjects.

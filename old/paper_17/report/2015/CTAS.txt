item 1a.  risk factors the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities.
in addition, this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements. the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as "estimates," "anticipates," "predicts," "projects," "plans," "expects," "intends," "target," "forecast," "believes," "seeks," "could," "should," "may" and "will" or the negative versions thereof and similar words, terms and expressions and by the context in which they are used. such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made. you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized. these statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties, potentially inaccurate assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report. factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the successful completion of the sale of cintas' investment in the shred-it partnership within the expected timeframe or at all; the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs; lower sales volumes; loss of customers due to outsourcing trends; the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions; fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs costs; costs and possible effects of union organizing activities; failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination, employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety; the effect on operations of exchange fluctuations, tariffs and other political, economic and regulatory risks; uncertainties regarding any existing or newly-discovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation; the cost, results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; disruptions caused by the inaccessibility of computer systems data, including cybersercurity risks; the initiation or outcome of litigation, investigations or other proceedings; higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products, the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events; the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock, if any; changes in federal and state tax and labor laws; the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service; and the ultimate impact of the affordable care act. cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward-looking statements or to otherwise update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events, circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made, except otherwise as required by law. the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face. additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business.
negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance.
negative economic conditions, in north america and our other markets, may adversely affect our financial performance. higher levels of unemployment, inflation, tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas' products and services. increases in labor costs, including the cost to provide employee-partner related healthcare benefits, labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor, higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles, the inability to obtain insurance coverage at cost-effective rates, higher interest rates, inflation, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and ancillary products and other services and selling and administrative expenses. as a result, these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations.
increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance.
we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national, regional and local providers. product, design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries. if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, cintas may be required to lower prices, which would hurt its results of operations. cintas' competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates, which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates. in addition, our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services in-house instead of outsourcing these services to us. these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations.
5
an inability to open new, cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts.
we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets. the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion. our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations, negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms, identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations, zoning laws and other similar factors. any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts, and, consequently, adversely affect our financial performance.
risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations.
historically, a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions. we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions. in addition, the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator. the failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by opec and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, limits on refining capacities, natural disasters and environmental concerns. increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations.
cintas has been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions. these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees' rights to a government-supervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation. we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees' rights to a government-supervised election. unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations.
the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states. political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial stability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. in addition, u.s. and foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the canadian dollar, british pound, and the euro. in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, revenue denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar represented less than 10% of our consolidated revenue. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenue, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. therefore, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies, particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue, will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
6
failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.
our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations, including employment laws and regulations, minimum wage requirements, overtime requirements, working condition requirements, citizenship requirements, transportation and other laws and regulations.  in particular, we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the u.s. department of transportation, or usdot, and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970, as amended, or osha.  we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot, osha and other laws and regulations to which we are subject.  changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business.  the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted. compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures. any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities, payment of damages to private litigants, or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations.
we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. we discuss these lawsuits and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail under the caption "item 3. legal proceedings" and in note 13 entitled litigation and other contingencies of "notes to consolidated financial statements." certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations.
our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations. we could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations. we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations. while based on information currently known to us, we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters, our liability could exceed forecasted amounts, and the imposition of additional clean-up obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
under applicable environmental laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property, whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials. while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions, we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to third-party actions, including tort suits.
we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. disruptions in the availability of computer systems, or privacy breaches involving computer systems, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales, results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk.
our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information, process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses. we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested. however, our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions, power outages, computer or telecommunication failures, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees. although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers. any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales, could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and, therefore, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. in addition, cyber-security attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches
7
that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. if the network of security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company, customer, or employee information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation.
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price.
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation. while we continue to evaluate our internal controls, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.
we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions.
we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture, which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization. this factor, along with our entire operation, depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees. competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses.
unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.
unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned outages, supply disruptions, failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws and/or regulations impacting our businesses, could adversely affect our results of operations. these events could result in customer disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems.
we may recognize impairment charges, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our long-lived assets for impairment when required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values. the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate. deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in: declining revenue, which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow; reductions in management's estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth; increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital; and deteriorating real estate values. if our assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge, this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.
our operating cash flows, combined with access to the credit markets, provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity. however, deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity and/or increase our cost of borrowing. in addition, credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition, along with deterioration in general economic conditions, may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings, which could increase our cost of borrowing. increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.

we may not be able to successfully complete the pending sale of our interest in the shred-it partnership, in which case we may encounter difficulties.
on july 15, 2015, cintas announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in the shred-it partnership to stericycle, inc., a global business to business compliance solutions provider specializing in complex and highly regulated arenas. upon closing of the transaction, the shred-it partnership will become a wholly owned subsidiary of stericycle. the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. however, we may not be able to complete the proposed sale within the expected timeframe or at all.
if we are not able to complete the proposed sale of our equity investment in the shred-it partnership, we will encounter risks related to the shred-it partnership, including difficulties in the combination of operations, services, and personnel, and may divert management's attention from business operations. the inability of the shred-it partnership to successfully combine the businesses in a manner that permits the entity to achieve the full revenue and cost synergies could adversely impact the value of our investment. the loss of revenue due to the shred-it partnership may have a dilutive impact that we may be unable to offset. we may also incur unexpected costs, including impairment charges, litigation, and other liabilities. as a minority partner in the partnership, our ability to influence our partner may be limited, and non-alignment of interests on various strategic decisions in the partnership may adversely impact our business. for example, our partner may: (i) have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; (ii) take actions contrary to our policies or objectives; (iii) undergo a change of control; (iv) experience financial and other difficulties; or (v) be unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations under the agreements governing the shred-it partnership, which may affect our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business strategy cintas provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types primarily throughout north america, as well as latin america, europe and asia. we bring value to our customers by helping them provide a cleaner, safer and more pleasant atmosphere for their customers and employees. our products and services are designed to improve our customers' images. we also help our customers protect their employees and their company by enhancing workplace safety and helping to ensure legal compliance in key areas of their business.
we are north america's leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs, as well as a significant provider of related business services, including entrance mats, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services, and first aid, safety and fire protection products and services.
cintas' principal objective is "to exceed customers' expectations in order to maximize the long-term value of cintas for shareholders and working partners," and it provides the framework and focus for cintas' business strategy. this strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which we have not historically served. we will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers.
to pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. this frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. the combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services.
we pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways. cintas has a national sales organization introducing all of our products and services to prospects in all business segments. our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. we also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion, especially in our first aid and safety and fire protection businesses. finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.
results of operations effective august 31, 2014, cintas classifies its businesses into three operating segments based on the types of products and services provided. the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. in addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and carpet and tile cleaning services are also provided within this operating segment. the uniform direct sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items. the first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment consists of first aid, safety and fire protection products and services. cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. revenue and income before income taxes for each of these operating segments for the years ended may 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 are presented in note 15 entitled operating segment information of "notes to consolidated financial statements." the company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.
previously, cintas classified its businesses into four operating segments. the document management services operating segment is no longer considered an operating segment. this operating segment consisted of document destruction services ("shredding") and document imaging and retention services ("storage"). on april 30, 2014, cintas completed its partnership transaction with the shareholders of shred-it international inc. (shred-it) to combine cintas' shredding with shred-it's shredding business. due to the deconsolidation of shredding, fiscal 2015 results exclude the results of shredding. shredding remains reported in continuing operations for fiscal 2014 (through april 30, 2014) and fiscal 2013. based on the change in reportable operating segments, the results of shredding for the years ended may 31, 2014 and 2013 are presented in corporate. additionally, effective august 31, 2014, storage is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and has been excluded from continuing operations and from operating segment results for all periods presented. in the quarter ended november 30, 2014, cintas sold storage in a series of transactions ("storage transactions"). please see note 17 entitled discontinued operations of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information.

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
on april 30, 2014, cintas completed the shredding transaction with shred-it to combine cintas' shredding with shred-it's shredding business (the "shredding transaction"). under the agreement, cintas and shred-it each contributed its shredding business to a newly formed partnership. please see note 9 entitled acquisitions and deconsolidations of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information on the shredding transaction.
fiscal 2015 total revenue was $4.5 billion, an increase of 0.2% over the prior fiscal year. revenue increased organically by 7.1% as a result of increased sales volume. organic growth excludes the impact of acquisitions, disposals, deconsolidations and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. revenue growth was negatively impacted by 6.6% because of the deconsolidation of shredding, which contributed $275.7 million of revenue in fiscal year 2014, and 0.5% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. acquisitions positively impacted the growth rate by 0.2%.
organic growth by quarter is shown in the table below.
organic growth first quarter ending august 31, 2014          7.3   %
second quarter ending november 30, 2014       7.2   %
third quarter ending february 28, 2015        7.5   %
fourth quarter ending may 31, 2015            6.0   %
for the fiscal year ending may 31, 2015       7.1   %
rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. revenue from the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment increased 7.2% compared to fiscal 2014. the increase resulted from an organic growth increase in revenue of 7.7%. the amount of new business grew, resulting from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. generally, sales productivity improvements are the result of increased tenure and improved training, which result in a higher number of products and services sold. revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.5% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
other services revenue, consisting of revenue from the operating segments of uniform direct sales, and first aid, safety and fire protection services as well as shredding (through april 30, 2014), decreased 18.0% compared to fiscal 2014. revenue increased organically by 5.0%. revenue growth was negatively impacted by 23.3% due to the deconsolidation of shredding and by 0.3% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. acquisitions positively impacted the growth rate by 0.6%.
cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products increased 4.6% compared to fiscal 2014. cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, mops, shop towels and other ancillary items. the cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products increase compared to fiscal 2014 was due to increased rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment sales volume.
cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid, safety and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the uniform direct sales operating segment, the first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment, and shredding through april 30, 2014. cost of other services decreased 16.2% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the deconsolidation of shredding partially offset by increases resulting from higher first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment sales volume.
selling and administrative expenses decreased $39.9 million, or 3.2%, compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to the deconsolidation of shredding partially offset by increases resulting from higher rental uniforms and ancillary products and first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment sales volume.
cintas realized a gain on the shredding transaction of $5.0 million in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of receiving certain additional proceeds. also during fiscal 2015, cintas sold stock in an equity method investment. in conjunction with the sale of the equity method investment, the company received a cash dividend. the sale resulted in the recording of a gain of $21.7 million in fiscal 2015.
17
net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $64.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $65.6 million in fiscal 2014. the decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to the capitalization of $0.6 million of interest in fiscal year 2015 versus no capitalization of interest in fiscal 2014.
income before income taxes was $658.3 million, an increase of $53.2 million, or 8.8%, compared to fiscal 2014. income before income taxes was positively impacted by a $5.0 million gain on the shredding transaction as a result of receiving certain additional proceeds and by a $21.7 million gain from the sale of the equity method investment. the remaining $26.5 million increase in income before income taxes was due primarily to revenue growing at a faster rate than expenses.
cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 37.2% for fiscal 2015 compared to 38.3% in fiscal 2014. excluding the impact of the shredding transaction, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 would have been 37.2%. see note 8 entitled income taxes of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for more information.
during fiscal 2015, cintas recorded a net loss on the investment in the shred-it partnership of $5.5 million. this loss was net of a tax benefit of $3.3 million. the shred-it partnership results in the period were adversely affected by integration costs and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the weakened canadian dollar.
net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2015 of $408.1 million was a 9.0% increase compared to fiscal 2014. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.44 was a 12.8% increase compared to fiscal 2014. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased due to an increase in earnings from continuing operations combined with a decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding. the decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding resulted from purchasing 10.3 million shares of common stock under the october 18, 2011, july 30, 2013 and january 13, 2015 share buyback programs during fiscal 2015 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment revenue increased $231.0 million, or 7.2%, and the cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products increased $84.0 million, or 4.6%. the operating segment's fiscal 2015 gross margin was 44.6% of revenue compared to 43.3% in fiscal 2014. the 130 basis point improvement was driven by many factors, including new business sold by sales representatives, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, and continuously improving the efficiency of internal processes. in addition, lower energy-related expenses increased gross margin 40 basis points.
selling and administrative expenses for the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment increased $61.0 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses. selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2015 was 27.5% for both fiscal 2015 and 2014.
income before income taxes increased $86.0 million to $593.0 million for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. income before income taxes as a percent of revenue, at 17.2%, increased 150 basis points from 15.7% in fiscal 2014. this increase is primarily due to the increase in gross margin discussed above.

cost of first aid, safety and fire protection services increased $28.7 million, or 9.9%, in fiscal 2015, due primarily to increased first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment volume. gross margin for the first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. the gross margin as a percent of revenue was 44.1% for fiscal 2015 compared to 43.8% in fiscal 2014. energy-related expenses decreased 40 basis points from fiscal 2014 and were the primary driver of gross margin improvement in fiscal 2015.
selling and administrative expenses increased by $14.9 million, or 8.4%, in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in labor and other employee-partner related expenses. selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue, at 33.6%, decreased from 34.3% in fiscal 2014, as revenue growth outpaced the increase in expenses.
income before income taxes was $59.2 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $10.3 million, or 21.0%, compared to fiscal 2014. income before income taxes as a percent of revenue, at 10.4%, increased from 9.5% in fiscal 2014, due to the reasons discussed above.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013

cintas' commercial paper program has a capacity of $300.0 million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group. this revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of $450.0 million. the revolving credit facility was amended on may 29, 2014 to extend that maturity date from october 6, 2016 to may 28, 2019, to adjust the applicable margin used to calculate the interest payable on any outstanding loans, and to adjust the facility fee payable under the agreement. we believe that this program, along with cash generated from operations, will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash requirements. no commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may 31, 2015 or 2014.
cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. these covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas' assets. these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) and interest coverage ratios. cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. if a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. as of may 31, 2015, cintas was in compliance with all debt covenants.
our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. as of may 31, 2015, our ratings were as follows:
rating agency               outlook    commercial paper   long-term debt standard &amp; poor's       positive   a-2                bbb+
moody's investors service   stable     p-1                a2
on june 26, 2015, standard & poor's rating agency raised its long-term credit rating for cintas to a-/stable.
in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. in addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.
to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda. for the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, obligations under capital leases due in one year, long-term debt and long-term obligations under capital leases.

cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans. the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas. future contributions are expected to be $41.9 million in the next year, $90.3 million in the next two to three years, and $99.5 million in the next four to five years.
(1)   long-term debt primarily consists of $1,300.0 million in senior notes (reference note 6 entitled long-term debt and derivatives of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for a detailed discussion of long-term debt).
(2)   operating leases consist primarily of operational facility leases.
(3)   interest payments could include interest on both fixed and variable rate debt. as of may 31, 2015, cintas did not have commercial paper outstanding, and therefore did not have any variable rate debt.

inflation and changing prices changes in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact cintas' consolidated financial results. management believes inflation has not had a material impact on cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on consolidated results of operations.
litigation and other contingencies cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. in the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of cintas. cintas is party to additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business. please refer to "part i, item 3. legal proceedings" and note 13 entitled litigation and other contingencies of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for a detailed discussion of certain specific litigation.
new accounting standards in february 2013, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2013-02, "comprehensive income (topic 220): reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income." asu 2013-02 requires an entity to present (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes) the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the item reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. for reclassification items not required under gaap to be reclassified
24
directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures currently required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts. the company adopted asu 2013-02 effective june 1, 2013. see note 14 entitled accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for details of the required disclosure.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)," to clarify revenue recognition principles. this guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers. this guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017 and will be required to be applied retrospectively. early application of the amendments in this update is not permitted. cintas is currently evaluating the impact that asu 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
no other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of "notes to consolidated financial statements." significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition rental revenue, which is recorded in the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment, is recognized when services are performed. other services revenue, which is recorded in the uniform direct sales operating segment, first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment, shredding until april 30, 2014 and the storage business that is reported as discontinued operations, is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer.
allowance for doubtful accounts cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts. this allowance includes an estimate based on historical rates of collections and allowances for specific accounts identified as uncollectible. the allowance that is an estimate based on the company's historical rates of collections is recorded for overdue amounts, beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages. the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment and the other operating segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each operating segment.
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances. the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market. an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification, as well as an estimate based on the company's historical rates of obsolescence.
uniforms and other rental items in service uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life of 18 months. other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. the amortization rates used are based on industry experience, cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas. these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements.
25
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and company specific experience, which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building improvements, 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements. when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets, as appropriate.
investments investments consists primarily of cash surrender value of life insurance policies and equity method investments. in general, equity method investments are initially measured at cost. however, an equity method investment resulting from a transaction in which a controlled group of assets that constitutes a business is deconsolidated is initially measured at fair value. cintas recognizes its share of the investee's earnings or losses in income. cintas also adjusts its share of the investee's earnings for intra-entity transactions, basis differences, investee capital transactions and other comprehensive income. equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable.
goodwill goodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. cintas completes an annual impairment test which may include an assessment of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which for the company is at the operating segment level. we determined that our reporting units are our rental uniforms and ancillary products, uniform direct sales, and first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segments. the test may also include the determination of the estimated fair value of cintas reporting units via comparisons to current market values, where available, and discounted cash flow analyses. significant assumptions may include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth, as well as discount rates. based on the results of the annual impairment tests, cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013. cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years or when indicators of impairment exist.
service contracts and other assets service contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally 5 to 10 years. certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification. no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.
general insurance liabilities general insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred, primarily related to worker's compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known. these changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
26
stock-based compensation compensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees, including stock options and restricted stock awards, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black-scholes option-pricing model. measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. see note 12 entitled stock-based compensation of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for further information.
litigation and environmental matters cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business. gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.
a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed in note 13 entitled litigation and other contingencies of "notes to consolidated financial statements."
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. see note 8 entitled income taxes of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date. cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized.
accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. based on cintas' evaluation of current tax positions, cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate.

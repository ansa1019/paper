item 1a.  risk factors.
our business faces many risks. we have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face. there may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries.
each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business, results of operations, financial condition or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries.
you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the sec or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us. our subsidiaries, cna financial corporation, diamond offshore drilling, inc. and boardwalk pipeline partners, lp, are public companies and file reports with the sec. you are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities.

risks related to us and our subsidiary, cna financial corporation if cna determines that its recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, cna may need to increase its insurance reserves which would result in a charge to cnas earnings.
cna maintains insurance reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims. insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date. the reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of variables which are highly uncertain. these variables can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events. key variables include claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claims handling, policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. mortality is the relative incidence of death. morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.
there is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as general liability and workers compensation, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled. the impact of changes in inflation and medical costs are more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period.
cna is also subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. these issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on cnas business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in cnas reserves. the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict.
emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to, uncertainty in future medical costs in workers compensation. in particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs and devices; increased health care utilization; and/or the future costs of health care facilities. in addition, the relationship between workers compensation and government and private health care providers could change, potentially shifting costs to workers compensation.
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, cna continually reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. if cnas recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. these charges could be substantial.
cnas actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies.
cnas active life reserves for long term care policies are based on cnas best estimate assumptions as of december 31, 2015 with no margin for adverse deviation. key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases. these assumptions, which are critical bases for its reserve estimates are inherently uncertain. if actual experience varies from these assumptions or the future outlook for these assumptions changes, cna may be required to increase its reserves. see the life & group non-core policyholder reserves portion of reserves  estimates and uncertainties section of md&a in item 7 for more information.
20
estimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain because the required projection period is very long and there is limited historical data and industry data available to cna, as only a small portion of the long term care policies which have been written to date are in claims paying status. morbidity and persistency trends can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to policyholder behavior, socioeconomic factors, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.
a prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in cnas reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting cnas obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to its reserves. this risk is more significant for cnas long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. in addition, cna may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases it requests. any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in cnas reserving assumptions may require an increase to its reserves.
if cnas estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, including changes in assumptions, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. these charges could be substantial.
catastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.
catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of cnas business. various events can cause catastrophe losses. these events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion and acts of terrorism. the frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable. in addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.
the extent of cnas losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any. as in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to cna to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, additional living expenses, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility. reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to unconventional terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. as a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.
additionally, claim frequency and severity for some lines of business can be correlated to an external factor such as economic activity, financial market volatility, increasing health care costs or changes in the legal or regulatory environment. claim frequency and severity can also be correlated to insureds use of common business practices, equipment, vendors or software. this can result in multiple insured losses emanating out of the same underlying cause. in these instances, cna may be subject to increased claim frequency and severity across multiple policies or lines of business concurrently. while cna does not define such instances as catastrophes for financial reporting purposes, they are similar to catastrophes in terms of the uncertainty and potential impact on its results.
cna has exposure related to a&ep claims, which could result in material losses.
cnas property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to a&ep claims. cnas experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to a&ep claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for a&ep. as a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported a&ep claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.
21
on august 31, 2010, cna completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of its legacy a&ep liabilities were ceded to national indemnity company (nico), a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion (loss portfolio transfer or lpt). the cumulative amount ceded under the loss portfolio transfer as of december 31, 2015 is $2.6 billion. if the other parties to the loss portfolio transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on a&ep claims covered by the loss portfolio transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4.0 billion or cna determines it has exposures to a&ep claims not covered by the loss portfolio transfer, cna may need to increase its recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against earnings. these charges could be substantial.
cna faces intense competition in its industry; cna may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business as well as the availability and cost of reinsurance.
all aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and cna must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services. cna competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. the competitor insurer landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, resulting in increased pressures on cnas ability to remain competitive, particularly in implementing pricing that is both attractive to cnas customer base and risk appropriate to cna. in addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. during periods in which price competition is high, cna may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. as a result, cnas premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.
additionally, cna purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. under cnas ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of cnas exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection cna purchases, which affects the level of its business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk cna retains. if cna is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost it deems acceptable, cna may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of its underwriting commitments.
cna may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.
cna has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on its balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. the ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge cnas primary liability for claims. as a result, cna is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. certain of cnas reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of cnas contractual relationship which increases the likelihood that cna will not be able to recover amounts due. in addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which cna believes are due to it. if the amounts cna collects from reinsurers are less than the amount recorded for any of the foregoing reasons, its net incurred losses will be higher.
cna may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by policyholders who hold deductible policies and/or who purchase retrospectively rated policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.
a portion of cnas business is written under deductible policies. under these policies, cna is obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant. as a result, cna is exposed to credit risk to the policyholder. if the amounts cna collects from policyholders are less than the amounts recorded, its incurred losses will be higher.
moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period). retrospectively rated policies expose cna to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium.
22
cna may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.
cnas investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable. financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors. changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices, and many other factors beyond cnas control can adversely affect the value of its investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which it discounts certain liabilities.
cna has significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. a decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing cnas net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of its existing fixed maturity investments. the value of cnas fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments cna holds. any such impairments which cna deems to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to earnings.
in addition, cna invests a portion of its assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than its fixed maturity investments. limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments and therefore may also limit cnas ability to withdraw assets. as a result of all of these factors, cna may not earn an adequate return on its investments, may be required to write down the value of its investments and may incur losses on the disposition of its investments.
cna is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit cna from operating its business.
insurance companies such as cna are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of cnas legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements. current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets such as lloyds, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdictions regulatory capital adequacy formula. if cna does not meet these minimum requirements, cna may be restricted or prohibited from operating its business. if cna is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimate or the occurrence of an event or if it incurs significant losses related to its investment portfolio, cna may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital. cna may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.
globally, insurance regulators are working cooperatively to develop a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups. finalization and adoption of this framework could increase cnas minimum regulatory capital requirement as well as significantly increase its cost of regulatory compliance.
cnas insurance subsidiaries, upon whom cna depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.
cna is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by jurisdiction. if cna is restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, cna may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. as a result, cna would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.
23
rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of cna and thereby adversely affect its ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.
ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. cnas insurance company subsidiaries, as well as cnas public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, a.m. best company (a.m. best), moodys investors service, inc. (moodys) and standard & poors (s&p). ratings reflect the rating agencys opinions of an insurance companys or insurance holding companys financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.
the rating agencies may take action to lower cnas ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. the severity of the impact on cnas business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of cnas insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.
in addition, it is possible that a lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on cnas ratings, independent of any change in cnas circumstances.
risks related to us and our subsidiary, diamond offshore drilling, inc.
the worldwide demand for diamond offshores drilling services has declined significantly as a result of the decline in oil prices, which commenced during the second half of 2014 and has continued into 2016.
demand for diamond offshores drilling services depends in large part upon oil and natural gas industry offshore exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in oil and gas prices. commencing in the second half of 2014, oil prices have declined precipitously and recently fell to a 12-year low of less than $30 per barrel. the dramatic reduction in commodity prices has caused a sharp decline in the demand for offshore drilling services, including services that diamond offshore provides and adversely affected its operations and cash flows in 2015. a prolonged period of low oil prices would have a material adverse effect on many of diamond offshores customers and, therefore its business.
oil prices have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond diamond offshores control, including:
●   worldwide supply and demand for oil and gas;

●   the level of economic activity in energy-consuming markets;

●   the worldwide economic environment or economic trends, such as recessions;

●   the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) to set and maintain production levels and pricing;

●   the level of production in non-opec countries;

●                     civil unrest and the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities involving the middle east, russia, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere;

●   the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and gas;

●   the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;

24
●   the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves and production;

●   available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation and refining capacity;

●   the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;

●   weather conditions, including hurricanes, which can affect oil and gas operations over a wide area;

●   natural disasters or incidents resulting from operating hazards inherent in offshore drilling, such as oil spills;

●   the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;

●   technological advances affecting energy consumption, including development and exploitation of alternative fuels or energy sources;

●   laws and regulations relating to environmental or energy security matters, including those purporting to address global climate change;

●   domestic and foreign tax policy; and

●   advances in exploration and development technology.

an increase in commodity demand and prices will not necessarily result in an immediate increase in offshore drilling activity since diamond offshores customers project development times, reserve replacement needs, and expectations of future commodity demand, prices and supply of available competing rigs all combine to affect demand for its rigs.
diamond offshores business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which has been cyclical and is significantly affected by many factors outside of its control.
demand for diamond offshores drilling services depends upon the level of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide, and those activities depend in large part on oil and gas prices, worldwide demand for oil and gas and a variety of political and economic factors. the level of offshore drilling activity is also adversely affected when operators reduce or defer new investment in offshore projects, reduce or suspend their drilling budgets or reallocate their drilling budgets away from offshore drilling in favor of other priorities, such as shale or other land-based projects, which could reduce demand for diamond offshores rigs and newbuilds. as a result, diamond offshores business and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to cyclical fluctuations.
as a result of the cyclical fluctuations in the market, there have been periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and lower dayrates, followed by periods of higher demand, shorter rig supply and higher dayrates. diamond offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such fluctuations. periods of lower demand or excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in periods of lower utilization and lower dayrates. during these periods, diamond offshores rigs may not obtain contracts for future work and may be idle for long periods of time or may be able to obtain work only under contracts with lower dayrates or less favorable terms which could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshores business during these periods. additionally, prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of diamond offshores drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.
diamond offshores industry is highly competitive, with oversupply and intense price competition.
the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants. some of diamond offshores competitors may be larger companies, have larger or more technologically advanced fleets and have greater financial or other resources than it does. the drilling industry has experienced consolidation in the past
25
and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job; however, rig availability and location, a drilling contractors safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered.
recent new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling rigs, cancelation or termination of contracts, as well as established rigs coming off contract during 2015, have contributed to the current oversupply of drilling rigs intensifying price competition. additional newbuild rigs entering the market are expected to further negatively impact rig utilization and intensify price competition as rigs are delivered.
diamond offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. during 2015, one of diamond offshores customers in brazil, petrobras, and diamond offshores five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 24% and 65%, of its annual total consolidated revenues. the loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse impact on diamond offshores financial results especially in a declining market where the number of diamond offshores working drilling rigs is declining along with the number of its active customers. in addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties, it could materially adversely affect utilization rates in the affected market and also displace demand for diamond offshores other drilling rigs and newbuilds as the resulting excess supply enters the market. while it is normal for diamond offshores customer base to change over time as work programs are completed, the loss of or a significant reduction in the number of rigs contracted with any major customer may have a material adverse effect on diamond offshores future business.
diamond offshore can provide no assurance that its drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that its current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.
currently, diamond offshores customers may terminate their drilling contracts under certain circumstances, such as if the drilling rig is destroyed or lost, if diamond offshore suspends drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment, excessive downtime for repairs, failure to meet minimum performance criteria (including customer acceptance testing) or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. diamond offshores drilling contract for the ocean blacklion, for example, requires it to successfully complete certain testing procedures for the rigs equipment, including the blowout preventers and well control systems. diamond offshore is currently undergoing the required testing. if these tests are not successfully completed, diamond offshores customer has the right to terminate the drilling contract or may request a renegotiation of the terms of the contract.
in addition, some of diamond offshores drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods often by tendering contractually specified termination amounts, which may not fully compensate diamond offshore for the loss of the contract. during depressed market conditions, certain customers have utilized such contract clauses to seek to renegotiate or terminate a drilling contract or claim that diamond offshore has breached provisions of its drilling contracts in order to avoid their obligations to diamond offshore under circumstances where it believes it is in compliance with the contracts. additionally, because of depressed commodity prices, restricted credit markets, economic downturns, changes in priorities or strategy or other factors beyond diamond offshores control, a customer may no longer want or need a rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig at a lower dayrate. for these reasons, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of diamond offshores existing drilling contracts, terminate their contracts without justification or repudiate or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. such renegotiations could include requests to lower the contract dayrate, lowering of a dayrate in exchange for additional contract term, shortening the term on one contracted rig in exchange for additional term on another rig, early termination of a contract in exchange for a lump sum margin payout and many other possibilities. diamond offshores contract backlog may be adversely impacted as a result of such contract renegotiations.
when a customer terminates a contract prior to the contracts scheduled expiration, diamond offshores contract backlog is adversely impacted, and it might not recover any compensation for the termination or any recovery diamond offshore might obtain may not fully compensate it for the loss of the contract. in any case, the early termination of a contract may result in diamond offshores rig being idle for an extended period of time. each of these results could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshores business. in addition, if a customer cancels
26
a contract or if diamond offshore elects to terminate a contract due to the customers nonperformance and in either case diamond offshore is unable to secure a new contract on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if a contract is disputed or suspended for an extended period of time or if a contract is renegotiated, it could materially and adversely affect diamond offshores business.
generally, diamond offshores contract backlog only includes future revenues under firm commitments; however, from time to time, diamond offshore may report anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been, but are expected to be, executed. diamond offshore can provide no assurance in such cases that it will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement. in addition, for the reasons described above, diamond offshore can provide no assurance that its customers will be willing or able to fulfill their contractual commitments. diamond offshores inability to perform under its contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements, or its customers inability or unwillingness to fulfill their contractual commitments to diamond offshore, may have a material adverse effect on diamond offshores business.
diamond offshore may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for its rigs.
diamond offshore has a number of customer contracts that will expire in 2016 and 2017. diamond offshores ability to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of its customers. given the highly competitive and historically cyclical nature of the industry, diamond offshore may not be able to renew or replace the contracts or it may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at dayrates that are below, and potentially substantially below, existing dayrates, or that have terms that are less favorable than existing contracts or it may be unable to secure contracts for these rigs.
diamond offshores contract drilling expense includes fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.
diamond offshores contract drilling expense includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of its drilling equipment, which is often not affected by changes in dayrates and utilization. during periods of reduced revenue and/or activity, certain of diamond offshores fixed costs will not decline and often it may incur additional operating costs, such as fuel and catering costs, for which it is generally reimbursed by the customer when a rig is under contract. during times of reduced utilization, reductions in costs may not be immediate as diamond offshore may incur additional costs associated with cold stacking of a rig (particularly if diamond offshore cold stacks a newer rig, such as a drillship, for which cold stacking costs are typically substantially higher than for a jack-up rig or an older floater rig), or it may not be able to fully reduce the cost of its support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs in that region. a decline in revenue due to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in contract drilling expense and could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshores business.
diamond offshore may enter into drilling contracts that expose it to greater risks than it normally assumes.
from time to time, diamond offshore may enter into drilling contracts with national oil companies, government-controlled entities or others that expose it to greater risks than it normally assumes, such as exposure to greater environmental or other liability and more onerous termination provisions giving the customer a right to terminate without cause or upon little or no notice. upon termination, these contracts may not result in a payment to diamond offshore, or if a termination payment is required, it may not fully compensate diamond offshore for the loss of a contract. in addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could adversely affect diamond offshores financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. while diamond offshore believes that the financial terms of these contracts and its operating safeguards in place may partially mitigate these risks, it can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a material negative impact on future operations or financial results.
27
contracts for diamond offshores drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in diamond offshores operating costs could adversely affect the profitability on those contracts.
diamond offshores contracts for its drilling rigs generally provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs it incurs on the project. many of diamond offshores operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond its control. in addition, equipment repair and maintenance expenses fluctuate depending on the type of activity the rig is performing, the age and condition of the equipment and general market factors impacting relevant parts, components and services. the gross margin that diamond offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in its operating costs over the terms of the contracts. in addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, diamond offshore may not be able to fully recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers. diamond offshores inability to recover these increased or unforeseen costs from its customers could materially and adversely affect its business.
rig conversions, upgrades or newbuilds may be subject to delays and cost overruns.
from time to time, diamond offshore adds new capacity through conversions or upgrades to its existing rigs or through new construction, such as the harsh environment, ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rig, ocean greatwhite, which is currently under construction. projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:
●   shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;

●   work stoppages;

●   unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;

●   unanticipated cost increases or change orders;

●   weather interferences or storm damage;

●   difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;

●   design and engineering problems;

●   disputes with shipyards or suppliers;

●   availability of suppliers to recertify equipment for enhanced regulations;

●   customer acceptance delays;

●   shipyard failures or unavailability; and

●   failure or delay of third party service providers, civil unrest and labor disputes.

failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract, resulting in a loss of contract drilling backlog and revenue to diamond offshore. if a drilling contract is terminated under these circumstances, diamond offshore may not be able to secure a replacement contract, or if it does secure a replacement contract, it may not contain equally favorable terms. in addition, impairment write-offs could result if a rigs carrying value becomes excessive due to spending over budget on a newbuild construction project or major rig upgrade.
28
diamond offshores business involves numerous operating hazards which could expose it to significant losses and significant damage claims. diamond offshore is not fully insured against all of these risks and its contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect diamond offshore.
diamond offshores operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, unstable or faulty sea floor conditions, fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes. the occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations, and oil spillage, oil leaks, well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled fires, any of which could cause significant environmental damage. in addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to marine hazards, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. any of the foregoing events could result in significant damage or loss to diamond offshores properties and assets or the properties and assets of others, injury or death to rig personnel or others, significant loss of revenues and significant damage claims against diamond offshore, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.
diamond offshores drilling contracts with its customers provide for varying levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities between its customers and diamond offshore with respect to the hazards and risks inherent in, and damages or losses arising out of, its operations, and diamond offshore may not be fully protected. diamond offshores contracts with its customers generally provide that diamond offshore and its customers each assume liability for their respective personnel and property. diamond offshores contracts also generally provide that its customers assume most of the responsibility for and indemnify diamond offshore against loss, damage or other liability resulting from, among other hazards and risks, pollution originating from the well and subsurface damage or loss, while diamond offshore typically retains responsibility for and indemnifies its customers against pollution originating from the rig. however, in certain drilling contracts diamond offshore may not be fully indemnified by its customers for damage to their property and/or the property of their other contractors. in certain contracts diamond offshore may assume liability for losses or damages (including punitive damages) resulting from pollution or contamination caused by negligent or willful acts of commission or omission by diamond offshore, its suppliers and/or subcontractors, generally subject to negotiated caps on a per occurrence basis and/or on an aggregate basis for the term of the contract. in some cases, suppliers or subcontractors who provide equipment or services to diamond offshore may seek to limit their liability resulting from pollution or contamination. diamond offshores contracts are individually negotiated, and the levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities in them can vary from contract to contract depending on market conditions, particular customer requirements and other factors existing at the time a contract is negotiated.
additionally, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in diamond offshores contracts may be limited or prohibited by applicable law or may not be enforced by courts having jurisdiction, and diamond offshore could be held liable for substantial losses or damages and for fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities. the indemnification provisions of diamond offshores contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and the laws or courts of certain jurisdictions may enforce such provisions while other laws or courts may find them to be unenforceable, void or limited by public policy considerations, including when the cause of the underlying loss or damage is diamond offshores gross negligence or willful misconduct, when punitive damages are attributable to diamond offshore or when fines or penalties are imposed directly against diamond offshore. the law with respect to the enforceability of indemnities varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is unsettled under certain laws that are applicable to diamond offshores contracts. current or future litigation in particular jurisdictions, whether or not diamond offshore is a party, may impact the interpretation and enforceability of indemnification provisions in its contracts. there can be no assurance that diamond offshores contracts with its customers, suppliers and subcontractors will fully protect it against all hazards and risks inherent in its operations. there can also be no assurance that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify diamond offshore will be financially able to do so or will otherwise honor their contractual obligations.
diamond offshore maintains liability insurance, which includes coverage for environmental damage; however, because of contractual provisions and policy limits, diamond offshores insurance coverage may not adequately cover its losses and claim costs. in addition, certain risks such as pollution, reservoir damage and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable. also, diamond offshore does not typically purchase loss-of-hire insurance to
29
cover lost revenues when a rig is unable to work. accordingly, it is possible that diamond offshores losses from the hazards it faces could have a material adverse effect on its business.
diamond offshore believes that the policy limit under its marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of its size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for its business. however, if an accident or other event occurs that exceeds diamond offshores coverage limits or is not an insurable event under its insurance policies, or is not fully covered by contractual indemnity, it could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshores business. there can be no assurance that diamond offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains, that its insurance will cover all types of losses or that diamond offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that diamond offshore will be able to obtain insurance against some risks.
diamond offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the gom.
because the amount of insurance coverage available to diamond offshore has been limited, and the cost for such coverage is substantial, diamond offshore self-insures for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the gom. this results in a higher risk of losses, which could be material, that are not covered by third party insurance contracts.
in addition, certain of diamond offshores shore-based facilities are located in geographic regions that are susceptible to damage or disruption from hurricanes and other weather events. future hurricanes or similar natural disasters that impact diamond offshores facilities, its personnel located at those facilities or its ongoing operations may negatively affect its business for those periods. these negative effects may include reduced or lost sales and revenues; costs associated with interruption in operations and with resuming operations; reduced demand for diamond offshores services from customers that were similarly affected by these events; lost market share; late deliveries; uninsured property losses; inadequate business interruption insurance; employee evacuations; and an inability to retain necessary staff.
significant portions of diamond offshores operations are conducted outside the united states and involve additional risks not associated with united states domestic operations.
diamond offshores operations outside the united states accounted for approximately 79%, 85% and 89% of its total consolidated revenues for 2015, 2014 and 2013 and include operations in south america, australia and southeast asia, europe, east and west africa, the mediterranean and mexico. because diamond offshore operates in various regions throughout the world, it is exposed to risks of war, political disruption, civil disturbance, acts of terrorism, political corruption, possible economic and legal sanctions (such as possible restrictions against countries that the u.s. government may consider to be state sponsors of terrorism) and changes in global trade policies. diamond offshore may not have insurance coverage for these risks, or it may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for such events at reasonable rates. diamond offshores operations may become restricted, disrupted or prohibited in any country in which any of the foregoing risks occur. in particular, the occurrence of any of these risks or any of the following events could materially and adversely impact diamond offshores business:
●   political and economic instability;

●   piracy, terrorism or other assaults on property or personnel;

●   kidnapping of personnel;

●   seizure, expropriation, nationalization, deprivation, malicious damage or other loss of possession or use of property or equipment;

●   renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;

●   disputes and legal proceedings in international jurisdictions;

30
●   changing social, political and economic conditions;

●   enactment of additional or stricter u.s. government or international sanctions;

●   imposition of wage and price controls, trade barriers or import-export quotas;

●   restrictive foreign and domestic monetary policies;

●   the inability to repatriate income or capital;

●   difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;

●   fluctuations in currency exchange rates and restrictions on currency exchange;

●   regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;

●   restriction or disruption of business activities;

●   limitation of access to markets for periods of time;

●   travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats;

●   difficulties in supplying, repairing or replacing equipment or transporting personnel in remote locations;

●   difficulties in obtaining visas or work permits for employees on a timely basis; and

●   changing taxation policies and confiscatory or discriminatory taxation.

diamond offshore is also subject to the u.s. treasury departments office of foreign assets control and other u.s. laws and regulations governing its international operations in addition to worldwide anti-bribery laws. in addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which diamond offshore operates, including laws and regulations relating to:
●   the equipping and operation of drilling rigs;

●   import-export quotas or other trade barriers;

●   repatriation of foreign earnings or capital;

●   oil and gas exploration and development;

●   local content requirements;

●   taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and

●   use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.

some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors, require use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. these practices may adversely affect diamond offshores ability to compete in those regions. it is difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international offshore drilling industry. the actions of foreign governments may materially and adversely affect diamond offshores ability to compete.
31
in addition, the shipment of goods, including the movement of a drilling rig across international borders, subjects diamond offshore to extensive trade laws and regulations. diamond offshores import activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations that differ in each of the countries in which diamond offshore operates and often impose record keeping and reporting obligations. the laws and regulations concerning import/export activity and record keeping and reporting requirements are complex and change frequently. these laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced and/or interpreted in a manner that could materially and adversely impact diamond offshores operations. shipments can be delayed and denied export or entry for a variety of reasons, some of which may be outside of diamond offshores control. shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled downtime for rigs. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil penalties, economic sanctions, seizure of shipments and/or the contractual withholding of monies owed to diamond offshore, among other things.
diamond offshore may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of its foreign earnings.
certain of diamond offshores international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by diamond foreign asset company (dfac), a cayman islands subsidiary that it owns. it is diamond offshores intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of dfac and its foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities. diamond offshore does not expect to provide for u.s. taxes on any future earnings generated by dfac and its foreign subsidiaries, except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to u.s. federal income tax. should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary, diamond offshore may be required to record additional u.s. income taxes, that, if material, could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshores business.
fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses.
due to diamond offshores international operations, diamond offshore has experienced currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not effectively hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. diamond offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital.
diamond offshore relies on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.
diamond offshores reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes it to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. certain components, parts and equipment that are used in diamond offshores operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. the failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond diamond offshores control and could materially disrupt its operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenue, as well as an increase in operating costs.
additionally, diamond offshores suppliers, manufacturers and service providers could be negatively impacted by current industry conditions or global economic conditions. if certain of diamond offshores suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to experience significant cash flow issues, become insolvent or otherwise curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to diamond offshore and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely impact diamond offshores business.
32
risks related to us and our subsidiary, boardwalk pipeline partners, lp boardwalk pipelines actual construction and development costs could exceed its forecast, and its cash flow from construction and development projects may not be immediate, which may limit its ability to maintain or increase cash distributions.
boardwalk pipeline is engaged in multiple significant construction projects involving existing and new assets for which it has expended or will expend significant capital and it expects to engage in additional growth projects of this type. the construction of new assets involves regulatory, environmental, legal, political, materials and labor cost, operational and other risks that are difficult to predict and beyond boardwalk pipelines control. any of these projects may not be completed on time or at all, may be impacted by significant cost overruns or may be materially changed prior to completion as a result of developments or circumstances that boardwalk pipeline is not aware of when it commits to the project, including the ability of any foundation shipper to provide adequate credit support or to otherwise perform their obligations under any precedent agreements. any of these factors could result in material unexpected costs or have a material adverse effect on boardwalk pipelines ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its growth projects.
boardwalk pipelines revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately on its expenditure of funds on a particular project. for example, if boardwalk pipeline builds a new pipeline or expands an existing facility, the design, construction and development may occur over an extended period of time and boardwalk pipeline may not receive any increase in revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service and customers begin using the new facilities.
boardwalk pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers.
credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. credit risk exists in relation to boardwalk pipelines growth projects, both because foundation shippers have made long term commitments to boardwalk pipeline for capacity on such projects and certain of the foundation shippers have agreed to provide credit support as construction progresses. if a foundation shipper fails to meet the contractual credit requirements, an adjustment to the scope of the project could occur to accommodate a reduced volume commitment or boardwalk pipeline may be forced to find new customers to replace the defaulting customer, which could reduce the returns on the project. boardwalk pipelines exposure also relates to receivables for services provided, future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by it to them under certain nns and pal services.
boardwalk pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues. for 2015, no one customer comprised more than 10% of its operating revenues, and the top ten customers comprised approximately 45% of revenues. if any of boardwalk pipelines significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to pay for services provided by boardwalk pipeline or contracted for with them, to post the required credit support for construction associated with its growth projects or to repay the gas they owe boardwalk pipeline, it could have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, boardwalk pipelines ferc gas tariffs only allow it to require limited credit support in the event that transportation customers are unable to pay for boardwalk pipelines services.
natural gas producers comprise a significant portion of boardwalk pipelines revenues and support several of its growth projects. for example, in 2015, approximately 50% of boardwalk pipelines revenues were generated from contracts with natural gas producers. during 2015, the prices of oil and natural gas declined significantly from an increase in supplies mainly from shale production areas in the u.s. should the prices of natural gas and oil remain at current levels for a sustained period of time, or decline further, boardwalk pipeline could be exposed to increased credit risk associated with its producer customer group, which would adversely impact boardwalk pipelines business.
33
boardwalk pipeline may not be able to replace expiring natural gas transportation contracts at attractive rates or on a long-term basis and may not be able to sell short-term services at attractive rates or at all due to market conditions such as narrower basis differentials and sustained changes in the levels of natural gas and oil prices which adversely affect the value of its transportation services.
transportation rates boardwalk pipeline is able to charge customers are heavily influenced by longer-term trends in, for example, the amount and geographical location of natural gas production and demand for gas by end-users such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and lng export facilities. as a result of changes in longer-term trends, a sustained narrowing of basis differentials corresponding to traditional flow patterns on boardwalk pipelines pipeline systems (generally south to north and west to east) has occurred, reducing the transportation rates and adversely impacting other contract terms boardwalk pipeline can negotiate with its customers for available transportation capacity and for contracts scheduled for renewal.
each year, a portion of boardwalk pipelines firm natural gas transportation contracts expire and need to be renewed or replaced. over the past several years, boardwalk pipeline has renewed many expiring contracts at lower rates and for shorter terms than in the past, or not at all. boardwalk pipeline expects this trend to continue, mainly for contracts to transport gas from west to east across its system, and therefore, it may not be able to sell its available capacity, extend expiring contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at attractive rates or for the same term as the expiring contracts. the prevailing market conditions may also lead some of boardwalk pipelines customers, particularly customers that are experiencing financial difficulties, to seek to renegotiate existing contracts to terms that are less attractive to it. these sustained conditions have had, and boardwalk pipeline expects will continue to have, a materially adverse effect on revenues, earnings and distributable cash flows.
in 2008 and 2009, boardwalk pipeline placed into service a number of large new pipelines and expansions of its system, including its east texas pipeline, southeast expansion, gulf crossing pipeline, and fayetteville and greenville laterals. these projects were supported by firm transportation agreements with anchor shippers, typically having a term of ten years and pricing and other terms negotiated based on then current market conditions, which included wider basis spreads and, correspondingly, higher transportation rates than those prevailing in the current market. as a result, in 2018 and 2019, boardwalk pipeline will have significantly more transportation contract expirations than other years. boardwalk pipeline cannot predict what market conditions will prevail at the time such contracts expire, but if the contracts are renewed, it expects that these contracts will renew at lower transportation rates than when the contracts were initially executed. for example, if these contracts were renewed at current transportation market rates, revenues earned from these transportation contracts would be materially lower. if boardwalk pipeline is unable to renew or replace these and other expiring contracts when they expire, or if the terms of any such renewal or replacement contracts are not as favorable as the expiring agreements, its revenues and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. these market factors and conditions could materially impact boardwalk pipelines business.
changes in energy prices, including natural gas, oil and ngls, impact supply of and demand for those commodities, which impact boardwalk pipelines business.
boardwalk pipelines business is not significantly impacted by the short-term change in commodity prices, however, its customers, a significant amount of which are producers, are directly impacted by changes in commodity prices, which can impact boardwalk pipelines ability to renew contracts at existing capacities or rates or impact the producers ability to make payment for the services it provides. the prices of natural gas, oil and ngls fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors. if the recent dramatic declines in the levels of natural gas, oil and ngls prices mentioned above were to continue for a sustained period of time, the businesses of boardwalk pipelines producer customer group would be adversely affected which, in turn, would reduce the demand for boardwalk pipelines services and could result in defaults or the non-renewal of contracted capacity when existing contracts expire. conversely, future increases in the price of natural gas and ngls could make alternative energy and feedstock sources more competitive and reduce demand for natural gas and ngls. a reduced level of demand for natural gas and ngls could reduce the utilization of capacity on boardwalk pipelines systems, reduce the demand for its services and could result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire and adversely impact its revenues, earnings and distributable cash flow.
34
legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls, substantial changes to existing integrity management programs, or more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject boardwalk pipeline to increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.
boardwalk pipelines pipelines are subject to regulation by phmsa of the dot under the ngpsa with respect to natural gas and the hlpsa with respect to ngls. the ngpsa and hlpsa govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of natural gas and ngls pipeline facilities. these laws have resulted in the adoption of rules by phmsa, that, among other things, require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas (hcas), such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. in addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing phmsa regulations for certain intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines, which regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law. compliance with these rules has resulted in an overall increase in maintenance costs. new laws or regulations adopted by phmsa may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of boardwalk pipelines operations, which could cause it to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.
the ngpsa and hlpsa were most recently updated by the 2011 act, which was signed into law in early 2012. under the 2011 act, maximum civil penalties for certain violations have been increased to $200,000 per violation per day, with a total cap of $2.0 million. the 2011 act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of phmsa through 2015, and directs the secretary of transportation to undertake a number of reviews, studies and reports, some of which may result in more stringent safety controls or inspections or additional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking. among other things, the 2011 act directed the secretary of transportation to promulgate rules relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation, pipeline material strength testing and verification of maximum allowable pressures of certain pipelines. although a number of the mandates imposed under the 2011 act have yet to be acted upon by phmsa, the provisions of the 2011 act continue to have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs. new pipeline safety legislation that will reauthorize the federal pipeline safety programs of phmsa through 2019 will be under consideration. passage of new legislation reauthorizing the phmsa pipeline safety programs is expected to require, among other things, pursuit of those legal mandates included in the 2011 act but not acted upon by phmsa.
further, boardwalk pipeline has entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers that utilize the design capacity of certain of pipeline assets, assuming that boardwalk pipeline operates those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipelines smys. boardwalk pipeline has authority from phmsa to operate those pipeline assets at such higher pressures; however, phmsa retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority. if phmsa were to withdraw or materially modify such authority, boardwalk pipeline may not be able to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on its pipeline assets and could incur significant additional costs to re-obtain such authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations.
boardwalk pipeline may not continue making distributions to unitholders at the current distribution rate, or at all.
the amount of cash boardwalk pipeline has available to distribute to its unitholders principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations and financing activities and the amount of cash it requires, or determines to use, for other purposes, all of which fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond the control of boardwalk pipeline. some of the factors that influence the amount of cash boardwalk pipeline has available for distribution in any quarter include:
                                               fluctuations in cash generated by its operations, including, as a result of the seasonality of its business, customer payment issues and the timing of payments, general business conditions and market conditions, which impact, for example, contract renewals, pricing, basis spreads, time period price spreads, market rates and supply and demand for natural gas and boardwalk pipelines services;

35
   the level of capital expenditures boardwalk pipeline makes or anticipate making, including for expansion, growth projects and acquisitions;

   the amount of cash necessary to meet current or anticipated debt service requirements and other liabilities;

   fluctuations in working capital needs;

   the ability to borrow funds and/or access capital markets on acceptable terms to fund operations or capital expenditures, including acquisitions, and restrictions contained in its debt agreements;

   the cost and form of payment for pending or anticipated acquisitions and growth or expansion projects and the timing and commercial success of any such initiatives; and

   unanticipated costs to operate boardwalk pipelines business, such as for maintenance and regulatory compliance.

there is no guarantee that unitholders will receive quarterly distributions from boardwalk pipeline. boardwalk pipelines distributions are determined each quarter by the board of directors of its general partner based on the boards consideration of boardwalk pipelines financial position, earnings, cash flow, current and future business needs and other relevant factors at that time. boardwalk pipeline may reduce or eliminate distributions at any time it determines that its cash reserves are insufficient or are otherwise required to fund current or anticipated future operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, growth or expansion projects, debt repayment or other business needs.
boardwalk pipeline may not be successful in executing its strategy to grow and diversify its business.
boardwalk pipeline relies primarily on the revenues generated from its long-haul natural gas transportation and storage services. as a result, negative developments in these services have significantly greater impact on boardwalk pipelines financial condition and results of operations than if it maintained more diverse assets. boardwalk pipeline is pursuing a strategy of growing and diversifying its business through acquisition and development of assets in complementary areas of the midstream energy sector, such as liquids transportation and storage assets, among others. boardwalk pipelines ability to grow, diversify and increase distributable cash flows will depend, in part, on its ability to close and execute on accretive acquisitions and projects. boardwalk pipeline may not be successful in acquiring or developing such assets or may do so on terms that ultimately are not profitable. any such transactions involve potential risks that may include, among other things:
   the diversion of managements and employees attention from other business concerns;

   inaccurate assumptions about volume, revenues and project costs, including potential synergies;

   a decrease in boardwalk pipelines liquidity as a result of using available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition or project;

   a significant increase in interest expense or financial leverage if it incurs additional debt to finance the acquisition or project;

   inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;

   an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets or the developed assets;

   unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and

   changes in regulatory requirements or delays of regulatory approvals.

36
additionally, acquisitions contain the following risks:
   an inability to integrate successfully the businesses boardwalk pipeline acquires;

   the assumption of unknown liabilities for which it is not indemnified, for which its indemnity is inadequate or for which its insurance policies may exclude from coverage;

   limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller; and

   customer or key employee losses of an acquired business.

there is no certainty that boardwalk pipeline will be able to complete these acquisitions or projects on schedule, on budget or at all.
boardwalk pipeline may not be able to replace expiring gas storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long-term basis and may not be able to sell short-term services at attractive rates or at all due to a sustained narrowing of price spreads between time periods and reduced volatility which adversely affect boardwalk pipelines storage services.
boardwalk pipeline owns and operates substantial natural gas storage facilities. the market for the storage and pal services that it offers is impacted by the factors and market conditions discussed above for boardwalk pipelines transportation services, and is also impacted by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads), and the volatility in time period price spreads. market conditions have caused a sustained narrowing of time period price spreads and a sustained decline in the price volatility of natural gas, which has adversely impacted the rates boardwalk pipeline can charge for its storage and pal services and the value associated with these services, especially when compared to previous historical levels. these market factors and conditions have adversely impacted boardwalk pipelines business.
boardwalk pipelines natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by ferc, including rules and regulations related to the rates it can charge for its services and its ability to construct or abandon facilities. fercs rate-making policies could limit its ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.
boardwalk pipelines natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by ferc, including the types and terms of services boardwalk pipeline may offer to its customers, construction of new facilities, creation, modification or abandonment of services or facilities, recordkeeping and relationships with affiliated companies. ferc action in any of these areas could adversely affect boardwalk pipelines ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, offer new services or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. this regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete any future project than competitors that are not subject to fercs regulations. ferc can also deny boardwalk pipeline the right to remove certain facilities from service.
ferc also regulates the rates boardwalk pipeline can charge for its natural gas transportation and storage operations. for cost-based services, ferc establishes both the maximum and minimum rates boardwalk pipeline can charge. the basic elements that ferc considers are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. boardwalk pipeline may not be able to earn a return or recover all of its costs, including certain costs associated with pipeline integrity activities, through existing or future rates. ferc can challenge the existing rates on any of boardwalk pipelines pipelines. such a challenge against boardwalk pipeline could adversely affect its ability to charge rates that would cover future increases in its costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain its current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return.
37
risks related to us and our subsidiaries generally in addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to, among other things, terrorism, hurricanes and other natural disasters, competition, government regulation, dependence on key executives and employees, litigation, dependence on information technology and compliance with environmental laws.
acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.
future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad, as well as possible retaliatory military and other action by the united states and its allies, could have a significant impact on the assets and businesses of certain of our subsidiaries. cna issues coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from a terrorism act. terrorist acts or the threat of terrorism, including increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of oil and gas, could affect the market for diamond offshores drilling services and boardwalk pipelines transportation, gathering and storage services. in addition, future terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm loews hotels. while our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to secure their assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.
changes in tax laws of jurisdictions in which we or our subsidiaries operate could adversely impact us.
changes in federal, state or foreign tax laws applicable to us or our subsidiaries could materially and adversely impact our and our subsidiaries tax liability, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including the amount of cash our subsidiaries have available to distribute to their shareholders, including us. in particular, potential changes to tax laws governing tax credits or relating to the taxation of interest from municipal bonds, foreign earnings and publicly traded partnerships could have such adverse effects.
our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations.
the businesses operated by our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal, state and local governmental regulations which impose or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies. governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies. risks faced by our subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following:
cna. the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of cnas policyholders and third-party claimants rather than its investors. each jurisdiction in which cna does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate its business, generally at the state level. any changes in federal regulation could also impose significant burdens on cna. in addition, the lloyds marketplace sets rules under which its members, including cnas hardy syndicate, operate.
these rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.
regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. cna may also be required by the jurisdictions in which it does business to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible or restrict cna from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas. each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. cnas share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.

diamond offshore. certain countries are subject to restrictions, sanctions and embargoes imposed by the united states government or other governmental or international authorities. these restrictions, sanctions and embargoes prohibit or limit diamond offshore from participating in certain business activities in those countries. diamond offshores operations are also subject to numerous local, state and federal laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials, the remediation of contaminated properties and the protection of the environment. the offshore drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly, can be affected by changes in tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. diamond offshore may be required to make significant expenditures for additional capital equipment or inspections and recertifications to comply with governmental laws and regulations. it is also possible that these laws and regulations may, in the future, add significantly to diamond offshores operating costs or result in a reduction in revenues associated with downtime required to install such equipment, or may otherwise significantly limit drilling activity.
in addition, diamond offshores business is negatively impacted when it performs certain regulatory inspections, which diamond offshore refers to as a 5-year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of its rigs. these special surveys are generally performed in a shipyard and require scheduled downtime, which can negatively impact operating revenue. operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. the number of rigs undergoing a 5-year survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter. diamond offshores business may also be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5-year surveys. intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5-year survey. although an intermediate survey normally does not require shipyard time, the survey may require some downtime for the rig. diamond offshore can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects.
in the aftermath of the 2010 macondo well blowout and the subsequent investigation into the causes of the event, new rules were implemented for oil and gas operations in the gom and in many of the international locations in which diamond offshore operates, including new standards for well design, casing and cementing and well control procedures, equipment inspections and certifications, as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive safety and environmental management system (sems). new regulations may continue to be announced, including rules regarding drilling systems and equipment, such as blowout preventer and well control systems and lifesaving systems, as well as rules regarding employee training, engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third party audits of sems programs. such new regulations could require modifications or enhancements to existing systems and equipment, or require new equipment, and could increase diamond offshores operating costs and cause downtime for its rigs if it is required to take any of them out of service between scheduled surveys or inspections, or if it is required to extend scheduled surveys or inspections, to meet any such new requirements. diamond offshore is not able to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of additional rulemaking, nor is it able to predict the future impact of these events on operations. additional governmental regulations concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of diamond offshores operations, and enhanced permitting requirements, as well as escalating costs borne by its customers, could reduce exploration activity in the gom and therefore demand for its services.
governments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect diamond offshores operations by limiting drilling opportunities.
boardwalk pipeline. boardwalk pipelines natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by ferc and phmsa of the dot among other federal and state authorities. in addition to ferc rules and regulations related to the rates boardwalk pipeline can charge for its services, federal regulations extend to pipeline safety, operating terms and conditions of service, the types of services boardwalk pipeline may offer, construction or abandonment of facilities, accounting and record keeping, and relationships and transactions
39
with affiliated companies. these regulations can adversely impact boardwalk pipelines ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, including by increasing the lead times to develop projects, offer new services, or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines.
our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.
our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, many of which have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in some cases impose strict liability, which could be substantial, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. for example, diamond offshore could be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to its operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused by others. boardwalk pipeline is also subject to laws and regulations, including requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which it disposes of waste, requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination resulting from a spill or other release, requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements.
we and our subsidiaries are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.
the u.s. congress and the environmental protection agency (epa) as well as some states and regional groupings of states have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas (ghg). in the absence of federal ghg-limiting legislation, the epa had adopted rules under authority of the clean air act that, among other things, establish potential for significant deterioration (psd) construction and title v operating permit reviews for ghg emissions from certain large stationary sources that are also potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions, which reviews could require securing psd permits at covered facilities emitting ghgs and meeting best available control technology standards for those ghg emissions. in addition, the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of ghg emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the u.s., including, among others, onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. in october 2015, the epa published a final reporting rule for certain onshore gathering and boosting systems consisting primarily of gathering pipelines, compressors and process equipment used to perform natural gas compression, dehydration and acid gas removal.
moreover, the epa proposed in august 2015 rules that will establish emission standards for methane and volatile organic compounds released from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmissions facilities, as part of the current u.s. president administrations efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. the epa is expected to finalize those rules in 2016. furthermore, the epa has passed a rule, known as the clean power plan, to limit ghgs from power plants, but on february 9, 2016, the u.s. supreme court stayed this rule while it is being challenged in the federal d.c. circuit court of appeals. if this rule survives legal challenge, then depending on the methods used to implement this rule, it could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas that boardwalk pipelines customers produce. although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact businesses of our energy subsidiaries, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on the businesses of our energy subsidiaries.
any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions or breach in our data security infrastructure could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.
we and our subsidiaries have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our businesses. we are dependent upon operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our businesses. any failure of our or our subsidiaries computer systems, or those of our or their customers, vendors or others with whom we and they do business, could materially disrupt business operations. computer and other business facilities and systems could become unavailable or impaired from a variety of causes, including among others, storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. in addition, it has been reported that unknown entities or groups have mounted so-called cyber attacks on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt
40
computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some cases, steal data. any cyber attacks that affect our or our subsidiaries facilities could have a material adverse effect on our and their business or reputation.
a significant breach of our data security infrastructure, resulting from actions by our employees, vendors, third party administrators or by unknown third parties, that impacts our data framework or causes a failure to protect personal information of customers or employees may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.
the foregoing risks relating to disruption of service, interruption of operations and data loss could expose us to monetary and reputational damages. in addition, potential exposure includes substantially increased compliance costs and requires computer system upgrades and security related investments. the breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations, both in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. any such legal or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
loss of key vendor relationships or issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could result in a materially adverse effect on our and our subsidiaries operations.
we and our subsidiaries rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the united states and abroad. these include, for example, vendors of computer hardware, software and services, as well as other critical materials and services. if one or more key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, or fails to protect our proprietary information, including in some cases personal information of employees, customers or hotel guests, we and our subsidiaries may experience a material adverse effect on our or their business or reputation.
we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of the long-lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries.
our subsidiaries regularly evaluate their long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. most notably, we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of offshore drilling equipment at diamond offshore, pipeline and storage assets at boardwalk pipeline and hotel properties owned by loews hotels.
in particular, diamond offshore is currently experiencing declining demand for certain offshore drilling rigs as a result of excess rig supply in the industry due, in part, to the numerous newly constructed rigs that have or will enter the market. as a result, these rigs will negatively impact utilization which could result in diamond offshore incurring additional asset impairments, rig retirements and/or rigs being scrapped.
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. the goodwill impairment test requires us to identify reporting units and estimate each units fair value as of the testing date. we calculate the fair value of our reporting units (each of our principal operating subsidiaries) based on estimates of future discounted cash flows, which reflect managements judgments and assumptions regarding the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, future industry conditions and operations and other factors. asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken.
we are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries.
we rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of cna, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies, and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. claims
41
of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders.
we could have liability in the future for tobacco-related lawsuits.
as a result of our ownership of lorillard, inc. (lorillard) prior to the separation of lorillard from us in 2008 (the separation), from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, notwithstanding the completion of the separation. in the separation agreement entered into between us and lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the separation, lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to lorillards tobacco business, including liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco-related litigation against us. an adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and equity. we do not expect that the separation will alter the legal exposure of either entity with respect to tobacco-related claims. we do not believe that we have any liability for tobacco-related claims, and we have never been held liable for any such claims.

overview we are a holding company. our subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business:
●   commercial property and casualty insurance (cna financial corporation (cna), a 90% owned subsidiary);

●   operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (diamond offshore drilling, inc. (diamond offshore), a 53% owned subsidiary);

●   transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids and gathering and processing of natural gas (boardwalk pipeline partners, lp
(boardwalk pipeline), a 51% owned subsidiary); and

●   operation of a chain of hotels (loews hotels holding corporation (loews hotels), a wholly owned subsidiary).

see below for a discussion of discontinued operations.
unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to loews corporation, the company, parent company, we, our, us or like terms refer to the business of loews corporation excluding its subsidiaries.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item 1a, risk factors, and item 8, financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.
consolidated financial results consolidated net income for 2015 was $260 million, or $0.72 per share, compared to $591 million, or $1.55 per share, in 2014. net income in 2014 included discontinued operations reflecting the sale of highmount exploration & production, llc (highmount) and cnas former life insurance subsidiary.
income from continuing operations for 2015 was $260 million, or $0.72 per share, compared to $962 million, or $2.52 per share, in 2014. the decline in income from continuing operations was primarily due to a reserve charge at cna and asset impairment charges at diamond offshore. in addition, parent company investment income declined as a result of lower performance of equity securities in the trading portfolio and decreased results from limited partnership investments.
cnas earnings decreased primarily due to a reserve charge of $177 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) resulting from the unlocking of actuarial assumptions related to future policy benefit reserves for the long term care business. excluding this charge, cnas earnings declined year-over-year primarily due to lower limited partnership results and a $38 million charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to a retroactive reinsurance agreement to cede its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities. this earnings decline was partially offset by improved underwriting results driven by higher favorable net prior year development.
diamond offshores results for 2015 include asset impairment charges totaling $341 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the carrying value of 17 drilling rigs, as well as lower rig utilization. in addition, earnings were impacted by a $20 million impairment charge to write off all goodwill associated with the companys investment in diamond offshore as well as increased depreciation and interest expense. in 2014, diamond offshore recognized an asset impairment charge of $55 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests).
boardwalk pipelines earnings increase primarily stemmed from the impact of a $55 million charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2014 related to the write off of all capitalized costs associated with the terminated bluegrass project. absent this charge, earnings were largely consistent with the prior year as additional revenues from the settlement of the gulf south rate case and a franchise tax refund related to settlement of prior tax periods were offset by lower natural gas storage revenues and increased depreciation and interest costs.
47
loews hotels earnings increased slightly as compared to the prior year as higher income from universal orlando joint venture properties was partially offset by higher interest expense and increased tax expense due to an adjustment for prior years estimates and higher florida state income taxes, reflecting increased profits at the universal orlando and miami properties.
book value per share decreased to $51.67 at december 31, 2015 from $51.70 at december 31, 2014. book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) increased to $52.72 at december 31, 2015 from $50.95 at december 31, 2014.
parent company structure we are a holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries. we rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to our shareholders. the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of cna, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies (see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8) and compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap, applied on a consistent basis. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. in general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.
we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, actual results could differ significantly from estimates, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or equity.
insurance reserves insurance reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. short-duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. long-duration contracts are primarily related to long term care and are estimated using actuarial estimates about morbidity and persistency as well as assumptions about expected investment returns and future premium rate increases. the reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty contracts represents the portion of premiums written related to the unexpired terms of coverage. the reserving process is discussed in further detail in the reserves  estimates and uncertainties section below.
reinsurance and other receivables an exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of ceded property and casualty and life reinsurance to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities cna has ceded under reinsurance agreements. an allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, cnas past experience and current economic
48
conditions. further information on cnas reinsurance receivables is included in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
additionally, an exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of amounts due from customers on other receivables. an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances currently due as well as in the future, managements experience and current economic conditions.
if actual experience differs from the estimates made by management in determining the allowances for doubtful accounts on reinsurance and other receivables, net receivables as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets may not be collected. therefore, our results of operations and/or equity could be materially adversely affected.
valuation of investments and impairment of securities we classify fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading which are both carried at fair value. fair value represents the price that would be received in a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date, the determination of which requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. securities with the greatest level of subjectivity around valuation are those that rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value and that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. these unobservable inputs are based on assumptions consistent with what we believe other market participants would use to price such securities. further information on fair value measurements is included in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
cnas investment portfolio is subject to market declines below amortized cost that may be other-than-temporary and therefore result in the recognition of impairment losses in earnings. factors considered in the determination of whether or not a decline is other-than-temporary include a current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. significant judgment exists regarding the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long term prospects of the issuer, the relevant industry conditions and trends, and whether cna expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. further information on cnas process for evaluating impairments is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
long term care policies future policy benefit reserves for cnas long term care policies are based on certain assumptions including morbidity, persistency, discount rates and future premium rate increases. the adequacy of the reserves is contingent on actual experience related to these key assumptions. if actual experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring cna to add to reserves.
a prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in cnas reserving discount rate assumption could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting cnas obligations under long term care policies, which may also require an increase to cnas reserves. in addition, cna may not receive regulatory approval for the premium rate increases it requests.
these changes to cnas reserves could materially adversely impact our results of operations and equity. the reserving process is discussed in further detail in the reserves  estimates and uncertainties section below.
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations under our benefit plans. the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and broader capital market expectations. changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.
49
in determining the discount rate assumption, we utilized current market information and liability information, including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. in particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities. the yield curve was applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans. the yield curves and indices evaluated in the selection of the discount rate are comprised of high quality corporate bonds that are rated aa by an accepted rating agency.
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we considered the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio and the expected investment horizon.
further information on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations is in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
impairment of long-lived assets the company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the company uses a probability-weighted cash flow analysis to test property and equipment for impairment based on relevant market data. if an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value of the asset. managements cash flow assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from the reported amounts.
goodwill goodwill is required to be evaluated on an annual basis and whenever, in managements judgment, there is a significant change in circumstances that would be considered a triggering event. management must apply judgment in assessing qualitatively whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. factors such as a reporting units planned future operating results, long term growth outlook and industry and market conditions are considered. judgment is also applied in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units assets and liabilities for purposes of performing quantitative goodwill impairment tests. management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples.
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. any resulting future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized. the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized, resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations. in addition, the ability to record deferred tax assets in the future could be limited resulting in a higher effective tax rate in that future period.
the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for certain of its foreign earnings as it intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities. however, if these earnings become subject to u.s. federal tax, any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results.
50
results of operations by business segment unless the context otherwise requires, references to net operating income (loss), net realized investment results and net income (loss) reflect amounts attributable to loews corporation shareholders.
cna financial reserves  estimates and uncertainties the level of reserves cna maintains represents its best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on cnas assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that cna derives, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain. as noted below, cna reviews its reserves for each segment of its business periodically and any such review could result in the need to increase reserves in amounts which could be material and could adversely affect its results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. further information on reserves is provided in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expense reserves cna maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled (case reserves) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (ibnr). claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the consolidated balance sheets under the heading insurance reserves. adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. the carried case and ibnr reserves as of each balance sheet date are provided in the discussion that follows and in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
cna is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. these issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on cnas business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims.
emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to, uncertainty in future medical costs in workers compensation. in particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs and devices, increased health care utilization and/or the future costs of health care facilities. in addition, the relationship between workers compensation and government and private health care providers could change, potentially shifting costs to workers compensation.
the impact of these and other unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of cnas claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions.
cnas property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have actual and potential exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (a&ep) claims. cnas experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to a&ep claims and the related claim adjustment expenses are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment reserves for a&ep. as a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported a&ep claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.
to mitigate the risks posed by cnas exposure to a&ep claims and claim adjustment expenses, cna completed a transaction with national indemnity company (nico), under which substantially all of cnas legacy a&ep liabilities were ceded to nico effective january 1, 2010 (loss portfolio transfer or lpt).
51
the loss portfolio transfer is a retroactive reinsurance contract. the cumulative amounts ceded under the loss portfolio transfer exceed the consideration paid, therefore cna has recognized a deferred retroactive reinsurance gain. this deferred gain is recognized in earnings in proportion to actual recoveries under the loss portfolio transfer. over the life of the contract, there is no economic impact as long as any additional losses are within the limit of the contract.
see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 for further discussion of the loss portfolio transfer, its impact on cnas results of operations and the deferred retroactive reinsurance gain.
historically, cna performed its actuarial review of a&ep claims in the fourth quarter. in 2014, cna was unable to complete the fourth quarter review because it determined that additional information and analysis of inuring third-party reinsurance recoveries was required. the reserve review was completed in the second quarter of 2015 and cna management adopted the second quarter of the year as the timing for all future annual a&ep claims actuarial reviews.
establishing property & casualty reserve estimates in developing claim and claim adjustment expense (loss or losses) reserve estimates, cnas actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. the data is organized at a reserve group level. a reserve group can be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial automobile liability for small or middle market customers, it can encompass several lines of business provided to a specific set of customers such as dentists, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. every reserve group is reviewed at least once during the year. the analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. in addition to the detailed analyses, cna reviews actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.
the detailed analyses use a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods and techniques to produce a number of estimates of ultimate loss. cnas actuaries determine a point estimate of ultimate loss by reviewing the various estimates and assigning weight to each estimate given the characteristics of the reserve group being reviewed. the reserve estimate is the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the losses paid to date. the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the case incurred loss (paid loss plus case reserve) is ibnr. ibnr calculated as such includes a provision for development on known cases (supplemental development) as well as a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported (pure ibnr).
most of cnas business can be characterized as long-tail. for long-tail business, it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. cnas long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability, workers compensation, general liability, medical professional liability, other professional liability and management liability coverages, assumed reinsurance run-off and products liability. short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical damage, marine, surety and warranty. property and casualty insurance operations contain both long-tail and short-tail exposures. other non-core operations contain long-tail exposures.
various methods are used to project ultimate loss for both long-tail and short-tail exposures including, but not limited to, the following:
●   paid development;

●   incurred development;

●   loss ratio;

●   bornhuetter-ferguson using paid loss;

●   bornhuetter-ferguson using incurred loss;

52
●   frequency times severity; and

●   stochastic modeling.

the paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident or policy years with further expected changes in paid loss. selection of the paid loss pattern may require consideration of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. claim cost inflation itself may require evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can impact the results. since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves.
for many reserve groups, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. this situation often exists for long-tail exposures. in addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers compensation.
the incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns. however, selection of the incurred loss pattern typically requires analysis of all of the same factors described above. in addition, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.
the loss ratio method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident or policy year. this method may be useful for immature accident or policy periods or if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly, or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. the selection of the expected loss ratio typically requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident or policy years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes and other applicable factors.
the bornhuetter-ferguson method using paid loss is a combination of the paid development method and the loss ratio method. this method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method and typically requires analysis of the same factors described above. this method assumes that future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. the use of the pattern from the paid development method typically requires consideration of the same factors listed in the description of the paid development method. the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year. for long-tail lines, this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.
the bornhuetter-ferguson method using incurred loss is similar to the bornhuetter-ferguson method using paid loss except that it uses case incurred losses. the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns. however, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place, and the method typically requires analysis of the same factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development methods.
the frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident or policy year to produce ultimate loss estimates. since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for reserve groups where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. in addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that impact the number and
53
size of claims. however, this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. projecting the ultimate number of claims may require analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to cna, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. estimating the ultimate average loss may require analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.
stochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular reserve group being modeled. for some reserve groups, cna uses models which rely on historical development patterns at an aggregate level, while other reserve groups are modeled using individual claim variability assumptions supplied by the claims department. in either case, multiple simulations are run and the results are analyzed to produce a range of potential outcomes. the results will typically include a mean and percentiles of the possible reserve distribution which aid in the selection of a point estimate.
for many exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. in such a case, cnas actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method. as claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. for most of cnas products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. in these cases, cna will not assign any weight to the paid and incurred development methods. cna will use the loss ratio, bornhuetter-ferguson and frequency times severity methods. for short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because cnas history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. however, cna may also use the loss ratio, bornhuetter-ferguson and frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures.
for other more complex reserve groups where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, cna uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.
periodic reserve reviews the reserve analyses performed by cnas actuaries result in point estimates. each quarter, the results of the detailed reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with cnas senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. cnas senior management considers many factors in making this decision. the factors include, but are not limited to, the historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications, the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns, the consistency of claims handling processes, the consistency of case reserving practices, changes in cnas pricing and underwriting, pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market and legal, judicial, social and economic trends.
cnas recorded reserves reflect its best estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts, consideration of the factors cited above and its judgment. the carried reserve may differ from the actuarial point estimate as the result of cnas consideration of the factors noted above as well as the potential volatility of the projections associated with the specific reserve group being analyzed and other factors affecting claims costs that may not be quantifiable through traditional actuarial analysis. this process results in managements best estimate which is then recorded as the loss reserve.
currently, cnas recorded reserves are modestly higher than the actuarial point estimate. for commercial, specialty and international, the difference between cnas reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by uncertainty with respect to immature accident years, claim cost inflation, changes in claims handling, changes to the tort environment which may adversely impact claim costs and the effects from the economy. for cnas legacy a&ep liabilities, the difference between cnas reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by the potential tail volatility of run-off exposures.
54
the key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve groups and accident or policy years. some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. an example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. however, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims. as a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions typically cannot be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked over time.
cnas recorded reserves are managements best estimate. in order to provide an indication of the variability associated with cnas net reserves, the following discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations in significant factors affecting cnas reserve estimates for particular types of business. these significant factors are the ones that cna believes could most likely materially affect the reserves. this discussion covers the major types of business for which cna believes a material deviation to its reserves is reasonably possible. there can be no assurance that actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the discussion. in addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and assumptions will not have a material impact on cnas reserves.
the three areas for which cna believes a significant deviation to its net reserves is reasonably possible are (i) professional liability, management liability and surety products; (ii) workers compensation and (iii) general liability.
professional liability and management liability products and surety products include professional liability coverages provided to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. they also include d&o, employment practices, fiduciary, fidelity and surety coverages, as well as insurance products serving the health care delivery system. the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates for these liability coverages is claim severity. claim severity is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. underwriting and claim handling decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim settlement decisions can also impact claim severity. if the estimated claim severity increases by 9%, cna estimates that the net reserves would increase by approximately $500 million. if the estimated claim severity decreases by 3%, cna estimates that net reserves would decrease by approximately $150 million. cnas net reserves for these products were approximately $5.4 billion as of december 31, 2015.
for workers compensation, since many years will pass from the time the business is written until all claim payments have been made, claim cost inflation on claim payments is the most significant factor affecting workers compensation reserve estimates. workers compensation claim cost inflation is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. if estimated workers compensation claim cost inflation increases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, cna estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $400 million. if estimated workers compensation claim cost inflation decreases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, cna estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $350 million. net reserves for workers compensation were approximately $4.3 billion as of december 31, 2015.
for general liability, the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates is claim severity. claim severity is driven by changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. if the estimated claim severity for general liability increases by 6%, cna estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $200 million. if the estimated claim severity for general liability decreases by 3%, cna estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $100 million. net reserves for general liability were approximately $3.6 billion as of december 31, 2015.
given the factors described above, it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims and related litigation. as a result, cna regularly reviews the adequacy of its reserves and reassesses its reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled and additional information becomes available in subsequent periods. in reviewing cnas reserve estimates, cna makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. these reviews have resulted in cnas
55
identification of information and trends that have caused cna to change its reserves in prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need for additional material increases or decreases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially affect our results of operations and equity and cnas business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings positively or negatively. see the ratings section of this md&a for further information regarding cnas financial strength and corporate debt ratings.

life & group non-core policyholder reserves cna maintains both claim and claim adjustment expense reserves as well as future policy benefit reserves for policyholder benefits for the life & group non-core business. claim and claim expense reserves consist of estimated reserves for long term care policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported. in developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for cnas long term care policies, its actuaries perform a detailed claim experience study on an annual basis. the study reviews the sufficiency of existing reserves for policyholders currently on claim and includes an evaluation of expected benefit utilization and claim duration. cnas recorded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves reflect its best estimate after incorporating the results of the most recent study. in addition, claim and claim adjustment reserves are also maintained for structured settlement obligations that are not funded by annuities related to certain property and casualty claimants. future policy benefit reserves represent the active life reserves related to cnas long term care policies and are the present value of expected future benefit payments and expenses less expected future premiums. the determination of these reserves is fundamental to its financial results and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected investment and policyholder experience over the life of the contract. since many of these contracts may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk.
while the structured settlement obligations arise under short duration contracts, long duration contract principles and actuarial methods are used to determine managements best estimate of the required claim and claim adjustment reserve.
56
under gaap, reserves for long term care future policy benefits and the unfunded structured settlement annuity claim and claim adjustment expense reserves were first established based on cnas actuarial best estimate assumptions at the date the contract was issued plus a margin for adverse deviation. actuarial assumptions include estimates of morbidity, persistency, discount rates and expenses over the life of the contracts. these assumptions are locked in throughout the life of the contract unless a premium deficiency develops. the impact of differences between the actuarial assumptions and actual experience is reflected in results of operations each period.
long term care policies provide benefits for nursing home, assisted living and home health care subject to various daily and lifetime caps. policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force. generally cna has the ability to increase policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.
the actuarial assumptions that management believes are subject to the most variability are morbidity, persistency and discount rate. persistency can be affected by policy lapses and death. discount rate is influenced by the investment yield on assets supporting long term care reserves which is subject to interest rate and market volatility. there is limited historical company and industry data available to cna for long term care morbidity and mortality, as only a portion of the policies written to date are in claims paying status. as a result of this variability, cnas long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to its expectations.
annually, management assesses the adequacy of its gaap long term care future policy benefit reserves as well as the claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for unfunded structured settlement obligations by performing a gross premium valuation (gpv) to determine if there is a premium deficiency. under the gpv, management estimates required reserves using best estimate assumptions, including anticipated future premium rate increases, as of the date of the assessment without provisions for adverse deviation. the gpv reserves are then compared to the recorded reserves. if the gpv reserves are greater than the existing net gaap reserves (i.e. reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs asset), the existing net gaap reserves are unlocked and are increased to the greater amount. any such increase is reflected in cnas results of operations in the period in which the need for such adjustment is determined, and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and equity and cnas business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.
prior to december 31, 2015, the active life reserves for long term care were based on actuarial assumptions established at policy issuance. the december 31, 2014 gpv indicated the carried reserves included a margin of approximately $100 million. the december 31, 2015 gpv indicated a premium deficiency of $296 million. a summary of the changes in the gpv results is presented in the table below:

december 31, 2015 premium deficiency                        $(296   )
the premium deficiency was primarily driven by changes in morbidity assumptions in particular by higher claim incidence, reflective of trends observed in cnas emerging experience. there are a variety of factors that impact claim incidence rates, including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, socioeconomic factors, changes in health trends and advances in medical care. the premium deficiency was also adversely affected by changes in persistency assumptions, primarily from lower projected active life mortality rates. adverse changes from morbidity and persistency were somewhat offset by increases in planned rate increase actions and changes in discount rate assumptions. the increase in planned rate actions was primarily due to updated assumptions on the approval rate and timing of future premium rate increases in cnas group block. changes in discount rate assumptions were
57
primarily due to changes in future interest rate assumptions, contemplating both near-term market indications and long-term normative assumptions. changes in expenses and other assumptions had a small adverse impact on the premium deficiency.
the indicated premium deficiency necessitated a charge to income that was effected by the write off of the entire long term care deferred acquisition cost asset of $289 million and an increase to active life reserves of $7 million. as a result, the long term care active life reserves carried as of december 31, 2015 represent managements best estimate assumptions at that date with no margin for adverse deviation. since there is no margin in the carried reserves, cna may have to unlock its reserve assumptions in the future. factors that could affect the need to unlock reserve assumptions include the significance and persistence of variances between actual experience and the expected results contemplated in the best estimate reserves as well as changes in cnas outlook of the future.
in addition to the premium deficiency, cnas annual experience study of claim reserves indicated a deficiency of $9 million. the deficiency was primarily related to updating claim frequency assumptions on incurred but not reported claims, offset by favorable severity on existing claims. the total impact of the premium deficiency and claim reserve deficiency was $177 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests).
the table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on cnas results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to its assumptions. cna has assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each policy group and would occur absent any changes, mitigating or otherwise, in the other assumptions. although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, cna believes they could occur based on past variances in experience and its expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur. the hypothetical revisions have been updated from the disclosures in prior periods to be reflective of cnas updated best estimate assumptions as of december 31, 2015 in support of its active life reserves. as a result, in some cases the scenarios described below are not directly comparable to prior periods. persistency now reflects active life mortality and lapse whereas prior periods reflected total lives. discount rates now reflect future interest rates only whereas prior periods reflected future interest rates and changes in cnas existing investment portfolio yield. the hypothetical scenarios for morbidity and premium rate actions are comparable to prior periods.

2015 compared with 2014
income from continuing operations decreased $411 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. results in 2015 were negatively impacted by a $177 million charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to recognition of a premium deficiency and a small deficiency in claim reserves in cnas long term care business as further discussed in the reserves  estimates and uncertainties section of this md&a. in addition, results in 2015 decreased $78 million ($46 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) as compared to 2014 as a result of the application of retroactive reinsurance accounting to adverse reserve development ceded under the 2010 a&ep loss portfolio transfer, as further discussed in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8. in addition, results in 2015 included lower net investment income and investment losses driven by lower limited partnership results and higher other than temporary impairment (otti) losses, partially offset by improved underwriting results. results in 2014 were impacted by a $31 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) loss on a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of cnas former life insurance subsidiary.
2014 compared with 2013
income from continuing operations decreased $27 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 due to lower net investment income of $215 million, primarily driven by reduced limited partnership results, lower favorable net prior year development and a $31 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) loss on the coinsurance transaction. these decreases were partially offset by an increase of $38 million ($22 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) in investment gains, improved current accident year underwriting results and the prior year impact of a $111 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting related to the loss portfolio transfer. further information on net prior year development for 2014 and 2013 is included in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.

cna property and casualty insurance operations cnas property and casualty insurance operations consist of professional, financial, specialty property and casualty products and services and commercial insurance and risk management products.
in evaluating the results of the property and casualty businesses, cna utilizes the loss ratio, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio and the combined ratio. these ratios are calculated using gaap financial results. the loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. the expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. the dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders dividends incurred to net earned premiums. the combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. in addition, cna also utilizes rate, retention and new business in evaluating operating trends. rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew. new business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers.
the following table summarizes the results of cnas property and casualty operations for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

(a)   for international, this does not include hardy new business.

2015 compared with 2014
net written premiums decreased $115 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. this decrease was driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates, the 2014 termination of a specialty product managing general underwriter relationship in canada and unfavorable premium development at hardy, for international, lower new business in specialty and the residual effect of previous underwriting actions undertaken in certain business classes, offset by positive rate, higher retention and new business in commercial. net earned premiums decreased $283 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, consistent with the trend in net written premiums.
net operating income decreased $42 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. the decrease in net operating income was due to lower net investment income and less favorable underwriting results in international, partially offset by improved underwriting results in commercial. catastrophe losses were $85 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2015 as compared to catastrophe losses of $92 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2014.
favorable net prior year development of $218 million and $50 million was recorded in 2015 and 2014. further information on net prior year development is included in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
specialtys combined ratio increased 1.1 points in 2015 as compared with 2014. the loss ratio increased 0.1 point due to deterioration in the current accident year loss ratio, primarily offset by higher net favorable prior year development. the expense ratio increased 1.0 point in 2015 as compared with 2014, driven by increased underwriting expenses and the unfavorable effect of lower net earned premiums.
commercials combined ratio improved 7.8 points in 2015 as compared with 2014. the loss ratio improved 10.2 points, due to favorable net prior year development for 2015 as compared to unfavorable net prior year development for 2014 and an improved current accident year loss ratio. the expense ratio increased 2.4 points in 2015 as compared with 2014, due to higher expenses including increased commissions, the favorable impact in 2014 of recoveries on insurance receivables written off in prior years and the unfavorable effect of lower net earned premiums.
62
internationals combined ratio increased 5.2 points in 2015 as compared with 2014. the loss ratio increased 6.0 points, primarily due to less favorable net prior year development and an increase in the current accident year loss ratio driven by large losses. the expense ratio improved 0.8 points as compared with 2014, due to lower expenses, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of lower net earned premiums.
2014 compared with 2013
net written premiums decreased $263 million in 2014 as compared with 2013. the decrease in net written premiums was primarily driven by a lower level of new business, reflecting competitive market conditions in commercial and specialty, underwriting actions taken in certain business classes in commercial and a 2013 commutation by hardy, partially offset by continued rate increases in commercial. net earned premiums decreased $58 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, consistent with decreases in net written premiums.
net operating income decreased $157 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to lower net investment income, less favorable net prior year development and a legal settlement benefit of $28 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013 for commercial, partially offset by improved current accident year underwriting results in specialty and commercial. catastrophe losses were $92 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2014 as compared to $100 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013.
favorable net prior year development decreased by $105 million, from $155 million in 2013 to $50 million in 2014. further information on net prior year development is included in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
specialtys combined ratio increased 0.5 points in 2014 as compared with 2013. the loss ratio increased 0.3 points due to less favorable net prior year development, partially offset by improvement in the current accident year loss ratio.
commercials combined ratio and loss ratio in 2014 were largely consistent with 2013. the expense ratio improved 0.3 points in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to the favorable impact of recoveries on insurance receivables written off in prior years.
internationals combined ratio improved 0.7 points in 2014 as compared with 2013. the loss ratio increased 0.1 points, due to the higher current accident year loss ratio, substantially offset by the impact of commutations. the expense ratio improved 0.8 points in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to decreased acquisition expenses.
other non-core operations other non-core primarily includes the results of cnas long term care business that is in run-off and also includes certain cna corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including cna re and a&ep. long term care policies were sold on both an individual and group basis. while considered non-core, new enrollees in existing groups were accepted through february 1, 2016.

2015 compared with 2014
net loss from continuing operations increased $264 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, driven by a $296 million charge related to recognition of a premium deficiency and a $9 million deficiency in claim reserves in cnas long term care business. the impact of both of these items was $177 million (after-tax and noncontrolling interests), as further discussed in the reserves  estimates and uncertainties section of this md&a. as a result of recognizing the premium deficiency, the actuarial assumptions used to determine long term care future policy benefit reserves were unlocked. the december 31, 2015 future policy benefit reserves for long term care are based on cnas best estimate assumptions with no margin for adverse deviation. since there is no margin in the carried reserves, cna may have to unlock its reserve assumptions in the future. factors that could affect the need to unlock reserve assumptions include the significance and persistence of variances between actual experience and the expected results contemplated in the best estimate reserves as well as changes in cnas outlook of the future. the periodic operating results for this business in 2016 will reflect any variance between actual experience and the expected results contemplated in cnas best estimate reserves.
excluding the effects of these items, results in 2015 were also negatively affected by higher morbidity in cnas long term care business. results in 2014 were negatively affected by a $31 million loss (after-tax and noncontrolling interests) on a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of cnas former life insurance subsidiary.
results in 2015 were also negatively impacted by an increase in gross a&ep claim reserves. while all of this reserve development is reinsured under the loss portfolio transfer, only a portion of the reinsurance recovery is currently recognized because of the application of retroactive reinsurance accounting. as a result, the comparison with 2014 was negatively affected by $78 million ($46 million after tax and noncontrolling interests), as further discussed in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8. additionally, results in 2015 benefited from lower interest expense due to the maturity of higher coupon debt in the fourth quarter of 2014.
64
2014 compared with 2013
results from continuing operations increased $107 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily driven by the prior year impact of a $111 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting related to the loss portfolio transfer. results in 2014 included a $50 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) benefit related to a postretirement plan curtailment, substantially offset by a $49 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) lump sum pension plan settlement, as further discussed in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
results in cnas long term care and life settlement business improved in 2014, but that improvement was substantially offset by the $31 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) loss on the coinsurance transaction related to the sale of cnas former life insurance subsidiary and results for cnas remaining structured settlements. the improved results in long term care were driven by higher net investment income attributable to a higher invested asset base and portfolio allocation of tax-exempt bonds, rate increase actions and the slightly more favorable net morbidity and persistency.
diamond offshore diamond offshores pretax income is primarily a function of contract drilling revenue earned less contract drilling expenses incurred or recognized. the two most significant variables affecting diamond offshores contract drilling revenues are dayrates earned and rig utilization rates achieved by its rigs, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. these factors are not within diamond offshores control and are difficult to predict. diamond offshore generally recognizes revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed, consequently, when a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenue will decrease as a result. revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, rig mobilizations, required surveys and shipyard projects. in connection with certain drilling contracts, diamond offshore may receive fees for the mobilization of equipment. in addition, some of diamond offshores drilling contracts require downtime before the start of the contract to prepare the rig to meet customer requirements for which it may or may not be compensated.
diamond offshores pretax income is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates, and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses. for instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or warm stacked state with a full crew. in addition, when a rig is idle, diamond offshore is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. however, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, diamond offshore may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to cold stack the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on pretax income. the cost of cold stacking a rig can vary depending on the type of rig. the costs of cold stacking a drillship, for example, is typically substantially higher than the cost of cold stacking a jack-up rig or an older floater rig.
operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of diamond offshores drilling equipment. the principal components of diamond offshores operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of diamond offshores operating expenses. in general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which diamond offshores rigs operate. in addition, the costs associated with training new and seasoned employees can be significant. costs to repair and maintain equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling rig is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which diamond offshores rigs are working.
pretax income is negatively impacted when diamond offshore performs certain regulatory inspections, which it refers to as a 5-year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of diamond offshores rigs. operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are generally performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs which are recognized as incurred. repair and
65
maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. the number of rigs undergoing a 5-year survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter.
in addition, pretax income may also be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5-year surveys. intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5-year survey. although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig, it normally does not require dry-docking or shipyard time, except for rigs, generally older than 15 years that are located in the united kingdom (u.k.) sector of the north sea.
during 2016, diamond offshore expects to spend approximately 535 days for the mobilization of rigs and contract acceptance testing, including days associated with mobilization and acceptance testing for the ocean greatwhite, which is under construction and expected to be delivered in mid-2016 and rig modifications and acceptance testing for the ocean blackrhino, which is scheduled to begin operating under a new contract in january of 2017. diamond offshore expects the ocean endeavor to be unavailable through mid-2016 as it demobilizes out of the black sea. diamond offshore can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects.
in april 2015, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (an agency established by the u.s. department of the interior that governs the offshore drilling industry on the outer continental shelf) announced proposed rules that, when enacted, will include more stringent design requirements for well control equipment used in offshore drilling operations. based on diamond offshores assessment of the proposed rules, it believes that it may need to incur significant capital costs to comply with the additional design requirements to enable its cold-stacked mid-water semisubmersibles to return to work in u.s. waters.
diamond offshore is self-insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the u.s. gulf of mexico (gom). if a named windstorm in the gom causes significant damage to diamond offshores rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. under its insurance policy, diamond offshore carries physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the gom for which its deductible for physical damage is $25 million per occurrence. diamond offshore does not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover its rigs.
in addition, under its current insurance policy, diamond offshore carries marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities, including coverage for certain personal injury claims, and generally covering liabilities arising out of or relating to pollution and/or environmental risk. diamond offshore believes that the policy limit for its marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of its size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for diamond offshores business. diamond offshores deductibles for marine liability coverage, including for personal injury claims, are $25 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $5 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims that might arise during the policy year.
recent developments market fundamentals in the oil and gas industry deteriorated further in the fourth quarter of 2015 and have continued to decline in 2016. in early january 2016, oil prices fell to a 12-year low below $30 per barrel, with some industry analysts predicting even lower commodity prices before any market recovery. oil markets continue to be volatile due to a number of geopolitical and economic factors. these factors, combined with significant operating losses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 by some independent and national oil companies and exploration and production companies, have caused most of these companies to announce additional cuts to their already reduced 2016 capital spending plans, reflecting delays in planned drilling or exploration projects, and, in some cases, termination of projects altogether. rig tenders are infrequent and have generally been limited to short-term or well-to-well work not commencing until 2017 or later. there have been very few rig tenders thus far in 2016.
the offshore floater market is currently faced with an oversupply of drilling rigs, which thus far has only been slightly abated by the cold stacking and retirement of rigs. the number of available rigs continues to grow as contracted rigs come off contract and newbuilds are delivered, increasing competition. competition for the limited number of
66
drilling jobs continues to be intense with some operators bidding multiple rigs on the same job, in some cases, bidding rigs of both higher and lower specifications. operators are also continuing to attempt to sublet previously contracted rigs for which capital spending programs have been delayed or canceled. industry analysts have predicted that the offshore contract drilling market may remain depressed with further declines in dayrates and utilization likely in 2016 and 2017.
as a result of the depressed market conditions and continued pessimistic outlook for the near term, certain of diamond offshores customers, as well as those of its competitors, have attempted to renegotiate or terminate existing drilling contracts. such renegotiations could include requests to lower the contract dayrate, lowering of a dayrate in exchange for additional contract term, shortening the term on one contracted rig in exchange for additional term on another rig, early termination of a contract in exchange for a lump sum margin payout and many other possibilities. in addition to the potential for renegotiations, some of diamond offshores drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract early after specified notice periods, sometimes resulting in no payment to diamond offshore or sometimes resulting in a contractually specified termination amount, which may not fully compensate it for the loss of the contract. during depressed market conditions, certain customers have utilized such contract clauses to seek to renegotiate or terminate a drilling contract or claim that diamond offshore has breached provisions of its drilling contracts in order to avoid their obligations to diamond offshore under circumstances where it believes it is in compliance with the contracts. particularly during depressed market conditions, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could adversely affect diamond offshores business. when a customer terminates a contract prior to the contracts scheduled expiration, diamond offshores contract backlog is also adversely impacted.
diamond offshores results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2015 have been materially impacted by depressed market conditions in the offshore drilling industry. diamond offshore currently expects that these adverse market conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. the continuation of these conditions for an extended period could result in more of its rigs being without contracts and/or cold stacked or scrapped and could further materially and adversely affect diamond offshores business. when diamond offshore cold stacks or elects to scrap a rig, they evaluate the rig for impairment. during 2015, diamond offshore recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $861 million, including an impairment loss of $499 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015.
as of february 16, 2016, 17 of diamond offshores rigs were not subject to a drilling contract with a customer, including 14 rigs that have been cold stacked. of the cold stacked rigs, four jack-up rigs are currently being marketed for sale. a previously cold stacked jack-up rig was sold in february of 2016.
globally, the ultra-deepwater and deepwater floater markets continue to be depressed. diminished or nonexistent demand, combined with an oversupply of rigs has caused floater dayrates to decline significantly. offshore drilling contractors have been approached by customers with binding contracts, who have sought to and have successfully renegotiated such contracts at lower rates to obtain some financial relief in the current market, and, in some cases, have terminated contracts with and without compensation to the associated drilling contractor. industry analysts expect offshore drillers to continue to scrap older, lower specification rigs; however, newer and higher specification rigs have not been immune to the recycling trend. in addition, industry analysts predict that the number of uncontracted floaters may more than double by the end of 2016.
newbuild rig deliveries and established rigs coming off contract continue to fuel an oversupply of floaters in both the ultra-deepwater and deepwater markets. in an effort to manage the oversupply of rigs and potentially avoid the cost of cold stacking newly-built rigs, which, in the case of dynamically-positioned rigs, can be significant, several drilling contractors have exercised options to delay the delivery of rigs by the shipyard or have exercised their right to cancel orders due to the late delivery of rigs. as of the date of this report, based on industry data, there are approximately 54 competitive, or non-owner-operated, newbuild floaters on order, 32 of which are not yet contracted for future work. in addition, based on industry reports, there are currently 20 newbuild floaters scheduled for delivery in 2016, of which only four rigs have been contracted for future work; however, industry analysts predict that delivery dates may shift as newbuild owners negotiate with their respective shipyards.
67
while conditions in the mid-water market vary slightly by region, mid-water rigs have been adversely impacted by (i) lower demand, (ii) declining dayrates, (iii) increased regulatory requirements, including more stringent design requirements for well control equipment, which could significantly increase the capital needed to comply with design requirements that would permit such rigs to work in u.s. waters, (iv) the challenges experienced by lower specification units in this segment as a result of more complex customer specifications, and (v) the intensified competition resulting from the migration of some deepwater and ultra-deepwater units to compete against mid-water units. to date, the mid-water market has seen the highest number of cold-stacked and scrapped rigs. since 2012, diamond offshore has sold 12 of its mid-water rigs for scrap. as market conditions remain challenging, diamond offshore expects higher specification rigs to take the place of lower specification units, where possible, leading to additional lower specification rigs being cold stacked or ultimately scrapped.
impact of changes in tax laws or their interpretation diamond offshore operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. as a result, it is subject to highly complex tax laws, treaties and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, which may change and are subject to interpretation. changes in laws, treaties and regulations and the interpretation of such laws, treaties and regulations may put diamond offshore at risk for future tax assessments and liabilities which could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows. further information is provided in notes 10 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
contract drilling backlog the following table reflects diamond offshores contract drilling backlog as of february 16, 2016 (based on contract information known at that time), october 1, 2015 (the date reported in our quarterly report on form 10-q for quarter ended september 30, 2015) and february 9, 2015 (the date reported in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014). contract drilling backlog as presented below includes only firm commitments (typically represented by signed contracts) and is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one-half of any potential rig performance bonuses. diamond offshores calculation also assumes full utilization of its drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. utilization rates, which generally approach 92% - 98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including, but not limited to, weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. no revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys. changes in diamond offshores contract drilling backlog between periods are generally a function of the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts. in addition, under certain circumstances, diamond offshores customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate its contracts.

(a)   a revenue earning day is defined as a 24-hour period during which a rig earns a dayrate after commencement of operations and excludes mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation days.

(b)                                                    utilization is calculated as the ratio of total revenue earning days divided by the total calendar days in the period for all rigs in diamond offshores fleet (including cold stacked rigs, but excluding rigs under construction). as of december 31, 2015, diamond offshores cold stacked rigs included one ultra-deepwater semisubmersible, two deepwater submersibles, and four mid-water semisubmersible rigs. in addition, diamond offshore had five cold stacked jack-up rigs which are being marketed for sale. as of december 31, 2014, six of diamond offshores mid-water semisubmersible rigs were cold stacked, all of which were sold for scrap in 2015.

(c)   utilization for diamond offshores deepwater floaters in 2015 included 365 total calendar days for the ocean apex, which was placed in service in december 2014.

(d)   average daily revenue is defined as total contract drilling revenue for all of the specified rigs in diamond offshores fleet per revenue earning day.

2015 compared with 2014
contract drilling revenue decreased $377 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, and contract drilling expense decreased $296 million during the same period. contract drilling revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in revenue earned by both mid-water and jack-up fleets, partially offset by an increase in revenue earned by both ultra-deepwater and deepwater floaters. the decrease in contract drilling revenue also reflects a decrease in revenue earning days primarily due to cold stacking, rig sales and incremental downtime between contracts for several rigs, partially offset by incremental revenue earning days for newly constructed and upgraded or enhanced rigs.
revenue generated by ultra-deepwater floaters increased $352 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in utilization of $248 million and higher average daily revenue earned of $104 million. total revenue earning days increased primarily due to incremental revenue days for diamond offshores newbuild drillships, the ocean endeavor, offshore romania, and the ocean monarch, offshore australia, partially offset by fewer revenue earning days for diamond offshores other ultra-deepwater floaters, including the early termination of drilling contracts for the ocean baroness and ocean clipper. average daily revenue increased in 2015 primarily due to revenue associated with the operation of three additional drillships and the ocean endeavor, including higher amortized mobilization and contract preparation revenue and a favorable dayrate adjustment for the ocean courage.
revenue generated by deepwater floaters increased $54 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to an increase in utilization of $55 million. the increase in revenue earning days resulted from incremental operating days for four rigs after prolonged periods of nonproductive time for planned upgrades and surveys, as well as warm stacking between contracts, partially offset by fewer revenue earning days due to the cold stacking of the ocean star and additional non-revenue earning days for rig mobilization and repairs.
revenue generated by mid-water floaters decreased $689 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to a decrease in utilization of $688 million. the decrease in revenue earning days resulted from the cold stacking or retirement of 12 mid-water rigs and the idling of the ocean guardian and ocean quest between contracts, partially offset by incremental revenue earning days for the ocean patriot, operating in the north sea, and the ocean ambassador, which is expected to complete its contract offshore mexico in the first quarter of 2016.
71
revenue generated by jack-up rigs decreased $94 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, primarily due to reduced utilization for five rigs that were under contract in 2014, but were cold stacked and marketed for sale at the end of 2015. in addition, revenue for 2015 was negatively impacted by a negotiated dayrate reduction for the remaining actively marketed jack-up rig, the ocean scepter.
a net loss of $156 million in 2015 and net income of $183 million in 2014 resulted in a change of $339 million due to the impact of a $341 million asset impairment charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2015 related to the carrying value of 17 drilling rigs, as compared to the prior year when diamond offshore recorded a $55 million asset impairment charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the carrying values of six drilling rigs. results in 2015 also include the recognition of a $20 million impairment charge to write off all goodwill associated with the companys investment in diamond offshore as well as higher depreciation and interest expense.
2014 compared with 2013
contract drilling revenue decreased $107 million in 2014 as compared with 2013. contract drilling revenue decreased primarily due to fewer overall revenue earning days, partially offset by higher average daily revenue primarily earned by ultra-deepwater floaters.
revenue generated by ultra-deepwater floaters increased $133 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 as a result of higher average daily revenue of $219 million, including the recognition of incremental mobilization and contract preparation fees of $51 million, partially offset by a decrease in utilization of $86 million. average daily revenue increased primarily due to several rigs operating under higher dayrates as compared to 2013. the reduction in revenue earning days is primarily due to incremental downtime for inspections and shipyard projects, including the ocean confidence life-extension project, downtime in between contracts and rig mobilizations, partially offset by a reduction in unscheduled downtime for repairs and incremental revenue earning days for the ocean blackhawk which was placed in service in 2014.
revenue generated by deepwater floaters decreased $123 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to lower utilization of $131 million, partially offset by higher average daily revenue of $8 million which reflected an increase in amortized mobilization and contract preparation revenue. the decrease in revenue earning days was the result of unplanned downtime associated with the warm stacking of rigs between contracts and incremental scheduled downtime for surveys and shipyard projects and rig mobilizations, partially offset by incremental revenue earning days for the ocean onyx which was placed into service during 2014.
revenue generated by mid-water floaters decreased $121 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to lower utilization of $62 million and lower average daily revenue of $59 million. the decrease in revenue earning days reflects the net impact of unplanned downtime associated with the cold stacking of rigs, unpaid equipment repairs and downtime between contracts, partially offset by a reduction in planned downtime for shipyard projects and regulatory inspections. the decrease in average daily revenue primarily reflects lower amortized mobilization and contract preparation revenue of $36 million and the ocean quest operating in vietnam at a lower dayrate in 2014 as compared with 2013, partially offset by higher dayrates earned by diamond offshores north sea rigs.
revenue generated by jack-up rigs increased $4 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase in average daily revenue of $14 million as a result of higher dayrates earned by several jack-up rigs during 2014, partially offset by lower utilization of $9 million compared to the prior year period.
72
net income decreased $74 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily reflecting the decrease in revenue, the impact of a $109 million impairment loss ($55 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the carrying value of diamond offshores semisubmersible rigs, higher general and administrative expense and depreciation expense, as well as an increase in interest expense related to the $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in november of 2013. general and administrative costs for 2014 include higher employee compensation and termination benefits paid to certain current and former key executives. these increases were partially offset by a $9 million gain ($3 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) recognized on the sale of the previously held for sale jack-up rig ocean spartan in the second quarter of 2014. diamond offshore recognized a charge for an uncollectible receivable of $23 million ($9 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013.
diamond offshores effective tax rate decreased in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to differences in the mix of diamond offshores domestic and international pretax earnings and losses. also contributing to the lower 2014 effective tax rate was the reversal of $55 million ($27 million after noncontrolling interests) of reserves for uncertain tax positions in various foreign jurisdictions which were settled in diamond offshores favor or for which the statute of limitations had expired. the 2013 period was negatively impacted by a provision of $57 million ($27 million after noncontrolling interests) related to an uncertain tax position in egypt, partially offset by the impact of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, which reduced income tax expense by $28 million ($13 million after noncontrolling interests).
as diamond offshores rigs frequently operate in different tax jurisdictions as they move from contract to contract, its effective tax rate can fluctuate substantially and its historical effective tax rates may not be sustainable and could increase materially.
boardwalk pipeline boardwalk pipeline derives revenues primarily from the transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids (ngls) and gathering and processing of natural gas for third parties. transportation services consist of firm natural gas transportation, where the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at receipt and delivery points along pipeline systems, plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported, and interruptible natural gas transportation, where the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is available and used. boardwalk pipeline offers firm natural gas storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, and interruptible storage and parking and lending (pal) services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used. boardwalk pipeline also transports and stores ngls. boardwalk pipelines ngl contracts for most of its services are fee based or based on minimum volume requirements, while others are dependent on actual volumes transported. boardwalk pipelines ngl storage rates are market-based and contracts are typically fixed price arrangements with escalation clauses. boardwalk pipeline is not in the business of buying and selling natural gas and ngls other than for system management purposes, but changes in natural gas and ngls prices may impact the volumes of natural gas or ngls transported and stored by customers on its systems. due to the capital intensive nature of its business, boardwalk pipelines operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of products transported, with the exception of fuel consumed at its compressor stations and not included in a fuel tracker.
market conditions and contract renewals transportation rates that boardwalk pipeline is able to charge customers are heavily influenced by longer term trends in, for example, the amount and geographical location of natural gas production and demand for gas by end users such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and liquefied natural gas (lng) export facilities. changes in certain longer term trends such as the development of gas production from the marcellus and utica production areas located in the northeastern u.s. and changes to related pipeline infrastructure have resulted in a sustained narrowing of basis differentials corresponding to traditional flow patterns on boardwalk pipelines natural gas pipeline systems (generally south to north and west to east), reducing the transportation rates and adversely impacting other contract terms that boardwalk pipeline can negotiate with its customers for available transportation capacity and for contracts due for renewal for boardwalk pipelines transportation services. these conditions have had, and boardwalk pipeline expects will continue to have, a material adverse effect on boardwalk pipelines revenues, earnings and distributable cash flows. further, during 2015, the prices of oil and natural gas declined significantly
73
from an increase in supplies mainly from shale production areas in the u.s. which has adversely impacted the businesses of certain of boardwalk pipelines producer customers. if the recent declines in prices were to continue for a sustained period of time, the businesses of other members of boardwalk pipelines producer customer group could be adversely affected which, in turn, would reduce the demand for boardwalk pipelines services and could result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity, or the renewal of capacity at lower rates when existing contracts expire.
a substantial portion of boardwalk pipelines transportation capacity is contracted for under firm transportation agreements. actual revenues recognized from capacity reservation and minimum bill charges in 2015 were $940 million. approximate projected revenues from capacity reservation and minimum bill charges under committed firm transportation agreements in place as of december 31, 2015, for each of the full years 2016 and 2017 are $1,010 million and $1,030 million. the amounts shown for 2015 and 2016 increased approximately $30 million and $110 million from what was previously reported in our 2014 10-k. approximately half of the increase in each year is due to contract renewals during 2015 and new contracts that were entered into in 2015. the remainder is due to the settled gulf south rate case, which resulted in a general increase in rates, and the extension to 2023 of certain nns contracts. included in these revenues are approximately $25 million for 2017 that are anticipated under executed precedent transportation agreements for projects that are subject to regulatory approval to commence construction. additional revenues boardwalk pipeline has recognized and may receive under firm transportation agreements based on actual utilization of the contracted pipeline facilities or any expected revenues for periods after the expiration dates of the existing agreements or execution of precedent agreements associated with growth projects or events that occurred subsequent to december 31, 2015 are not included in these amounts.
each year a portion of boardwalk pipelines firm transportation agreements expire and need to be renewed or replaced. over the past several years, boardwalk pipeline has renewed many expiring transportation contracts at lower rates and for shorter terms than in the past, or not renewed the contracts at all which has materially adversely impacted transportation revenues. capacity not renewed and available for sale on a short term basis has been and continues to be sold under short term firm or interruptible contracts at rates reflective of basis spreads, which generally have been lower than historical rates, or in some cases not sold at all. rates for short term and interruptible transportation services are influenced by the factors discussed above but can be more heavily affected by shorter term conditions such as current and forecasted weather.
demand has increased to transport gas from north to south, instead of south to north as had been the traditional flow pattern. this demand is being driven primarily by increases in gas production from the marcellus and utica production areas and growing demand for natural gas in the gulf coast area from new and planned power plants, petrochemical facilities and lng export facilities. this flow pattern has resulted in growth opportunities for boardwalk pipeline that require significant capital expenditures, among other things, to make parts of boardwalk pipelines system bi-directional, and in many instances, will utilize existing pipeline capacity that has been turned back to boardwalk pipeline by customers that have not renewed expiring contracts. these projects have lengthy planning and construction periods and as a result, will not contribute to boardwalk pipelines earnings and cash flows until they are placed into service over the next several years. in some instances the projects remain subject to regulatory approval to commence construction. these projects are also subject to the risk that they may not be completed, may be impacted by significant cost overruns or may be materially changed prior to completion as a result of future developments or circumstances that boardwalk pipeline cannot predict at this time.
the value of boardwalk pipelines storage and pal services (comprised of parking gas for customers and/or lending gas to customers) is affected by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads), price volatility of natural gas and other factors. boardwalk pipelines storage and parking services have greater value when the natural gas futures market is in contango (a positive time period price spread, meaning that current price quotes for delivery of natural gas further in the future are higher than in the nearer term), while its lending service has greater value when the futures market is backwardated (a negative time period price spread, meaning that current price quotes for delivery of natural gas in the nearer term are higher than further in the future). the value of both storage and pal services may also be favorably impacted by increased volatility in the price of natural gas, which allows boardwalk pipeline to optimize the value of its storage and pal capacity.
74
boardwalk pipeline has seen the value of its storage and pal services adversely impacted by some of the market factors discussed above, as well as there being fewer market participants from a decrease in the number of marketers taking storage positions, which has contributed to a narrowing of time period price spreads. although in recent months, boardwalk pipeline has seen an increase in volatility that has allowed it to lock in favorable price spreads, generally, these factors have reduced the rates it can charge and the capacity it can sell under its storage and pal services.
pipeline system maintenance boardwalk pipeline incurs substantial costs for ongoing maintenance of its pipeline systems and related facilities, including those incurred for pipeline integrity management activities, equipment overhauls, general upkeep and repairs. these costs are not dependent on the amount of revenues earned from its natural gas transportation services. the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration (phmsa) has developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas. these regulations have resulted in an overall increase in ongoing maintenance costs, including maintenance capital and maintenance expense. phmsa has proposed more stringent regulations, including expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, leak detection system installation, pipeline material strength testing and verification of maximum allowable pressures of certain pipelines, which if implemented, could require boardwalk pipeline to incur significant additional costs.
maintenance costs may be capitalized or expensed, depending on the nature of the activities. for any given reporting period, the mix of projects that boardwalk pipeline undertakes will affect the amounts it records as property, plant and equipment on its balance sheet or recognize as expenses, which impacts boardwalk pipelines earnings. in 2016, boardwalk pipeline expects to incur approximately $330 million to maintain its pipeline systems, of which approximately $130 million is expected to be maintenance capital. in 2015, these costs were $352 million, of which $143 million was recorded as maintenance capital. the projected decrease of approximately $22 million is primarily driven by the completion, in 2015, of maintenance activities associated with certain brine facilities. the maintenance capital amounts discussed above reflect pipeline integrity upgrades associated with certain segments of boardwalk pipelines natural gas pipelines which will be completed over the ensuing three years.
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. boardwalk pipeline actively monitors its customers credit profiles, as well as, the portion of its revenues generated from investment-grade and non-investment-grade customers. approximately $1.0 billion of operating revenues in 2015 were earned from boardwalk pipelines top 50 customers. while almost all of these customers are rated investment-grade by at least one of the major credit rating agencies, many oil and gas producers have recently had their ratings placed under review.
credit risk also exists in relation to boardwalk pipelines growth projects, both because the foundation shippers have made long-term commitments to it for capacity on such projects and certain of the foundation shippers have agreed to provide credit support as construction progresses. a large majority of these foundation shippers are rated investment-grade by at least one of the major credit rating agencies. as discussed elsewhere in this filing, boardwalk pipeline had one customer fail to post the required credit support on the contractually required date.
natural gas producers comprise a significant portion of boardwalk pipelines revenues. for example, in 2015, approximately 50% of its revenues were generated from contracts with natural gas producers. during 2015, the prices of oil and natural gas declined significantly due to an increase in supplies mainly from shale production areas in the u.s. should the prices of natural gas and oil remain at current levels for a sustained period of time, or decline further, boardwalk pipeline could be exposed to increased credit risk associated with its producer customer group. boardwalk pipeline continues to monitor its credit risk carefully, especially as it relates to customers that may be affected by the current oil and natural gas markets.
75
gulf south rate case in october of 2014, boardwalk pipelines gulf south subsidiary filed a rate case with the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) pursuant to section 4 of the natural gas act of 1938 (docket no. rp15-65), in which gulf south requested, among other things, a reconfiguration of the transportation rate zones on the gulf south system and, in general, an increase in its tariff rates. in 2015, an uncontested settlement was reached with gulf souths customers and approved by the ferc. the settlement will become effective march 1, 2016.
the settlement provides for, among other things, (a) a system-wide rate design across the majority of the pipeline system; (b) a fuel tracker for determining future fuel rates; (c) a moratorium which prevents gulf south or its customers from modifying the settlement rates until may 1, 2023, with certain exceptions; and (d) an extension of all no notice service (nns) contracts to the end of the moratorium period at maximum rates, subject to each customers right to reduce capacity under those agreements from current levels by up to 6% on april 1, 2016, and by up to another 6% of their remaining contract capacity by april 1, 2020. the nns customers had to elect by december 1, 2015, whether they wanted to reduce their initial contracted capacity. only two nns customers elected to reduce their contracted capacity effective on april 1, 2016.
the settled rates were moved into effect on november 1, 2015. refunds for the difference between the rates as filed and as settled are required to be paid to customers by may 1, 2016. for 2015, boardwalk pipeline recognized $20 million of additional operating revenues as a result of the rate case. based on current, contracted capacity, and the elections made by gulf souths nns customers, boardwalk pipeline expects to recognize approximately $30 million in net revenues as a result of the rate case in 2016.

2015 compared with 2014
total revenues increased $18 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. this increase is primarily due to higher transportation revenues of $39 million resulting from growth projects recently placed into service and includes $20 million of additional revenues from the gulf south rate case. the recently acquired evangeline pipeline contributed an additional $11 million and boardwalk pipeline received $8 million of proceeds related to a business interruption claim. these increases were partially offset by the comparably warm weather experienced in the early part of the 2015 period in boardwalk pipelines market areas, a decrease in fuel retained due to lower natural gas prices and the effects of market and contract renewal conditions discussed above. storage and pal revenues were lower by $20 million primarily as a result of the effects of unfavorable market conditions on time period price spreads.
76
operating expenses decreased $80 million for 2015 as compared with 2014. this decrease is primarily due to a $94 million prior year charge to write off all capitalized costs associated with the terminated bluegrass project, a $10 million franchise tax refund related to settlement of prior tax periods and a decrease in fuel and transportation expense due to lower natural gas prices. these decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense of $35 million from an increase in the asset base, including the evangeline acquisition and a change in the estimated lives of certain older, low-pressure assets. maintenance expense increased by $15 million primarily due to pipeline system maintenance activities as discussed above and the evangeline acquisition. interest expense increased $11 million primarily due to higher average debt balances as compared with 2014, lower capitalized interest related to capital projects and the expensing of previously deferred costs related to the refinancing of the revolving credit facility.
net income for 2015 increased $56 million as compared with 2014, primarily reflecting the prior year bluegrass charge of $55 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) and higher revenues partially offset by higher depreciation and interest expense as discussed above.
2014 compared with 2013
total revenues increased $4 million in 2014, compared with 2013. this increase is primarily due to a $27 million increase in transportation and other revenues generally due to the colder than normal winter weather in boardwalk pipelines market areas and growth projects which were recently placed into service, partially offset by lower firm transportation revenues due to the effects of the market and contract renewal conditions discussed above. additionally, revenues increased $13 million from fuel retained primarily due to higher natural gas prices and $15 million from gas sales associated with the flag city processing plant, which were offset by gas purchases recorded in operating expenses. storage and parking and lending revenues were lower by $22 million primarily as a result of the effects of unfavorable market conditions on natural gas time period price spreads. the 2013 period was favorably impacted by a $30 million gain from the sale of storage gas.
operating expenses increased $155 million in 2014, compared with 2013. this increase is primarily due to a charge of $94 million to write off previously capitalized costs incurred for the bluegrass project, a project with the williams companies, inc. which was dissolved due to cost escalations, construction delays and lack of customer commitments. the higher operating expenses were also caused by a $27 million increase in fuel and transportation expenses primarily driven by gas purchases for the flag city processing plant which were offset in revenues and the effects of higher natural gas prices on fuel, a $17 million increase in depreciation expense primarily due to an increase in the asset base and a $12 million increase in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to increased maintenance expense projects.
net income for 2014 decreased $60 million as compared to 2013 period primarily reflecting the bluegrass project related charge and higher operations, maintenance and depreciation expense, partially offset by the prior year goodwill impairment charge of $16 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) discussed further below.

2015 compared with 2014
operating revenues increased $129 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of two hotels during 2015 and three hotels during 2014.
operating and depreciation expenses increased $116 million and $17 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of two hotels during 2015 and three hotels during 2014.
equity income increased $18 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to improved performance of the universal orlando joint ventures, partially offset by a $5 million impairment of a joint venture equity interest in a hotel property.
interest expense increased $7 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to higher debt levels, including refinancings and new property-level debt incurred to fund acquisitions.
net income increased slightly as compared to the prior year as higher income from universal orlando joint venture properties was partially offset by the negative impact of transaction and transition costs for hotels acquired during the year and higher interest expense. in addition, the effective tax rate increased due to an adjustment for prior years estimate and a higher state tax accrual for an increase in the ratio of florida based income.
2014 compared with 2013
operating revenues increased $75 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to acquisitions in 2014 and the reopening in january of 2014 of the loews regency new york hotel, which was closed for renovation in 2013. these increases were partially offset by the reduction in revenue recognized by loews hotels as a result of the sale of equity interests in two hotels in july of 2013. for periods following the sale of these equity interests, loews hotels share of earnings or losses for these hotels is included in equity income from joint ventures.
operating expenses increased $52 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the addition of three hotels and the reopening of the loews regency new york hotel, partially offset by a reduction in expenses as a result of the sale of equity interests in two hotels.
78
equity income from joint venture properties increased $12 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to improved performance of the universal orlando properties, including the addition of universals cabana bay beach resort.
interest expense increased $5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the refinancing of a $125 million mortgage loan for a new $300 million mortgage loan and incremental interest expense from property-level debt incurred to fund acquisitions. these increases were partially offset by the reduction in interest expense as a result of the sale of equity interests in two hotels.
corporate and other corporate and other operations consist primarily of investment income at the parent company, corporate interest expenses and other corporate administrative costs. investment income includes earnings on cash and short term investments held at the parent company level to meet current and future liquidity needs, as well as results of limited partnership investments and the trading portfolio.

liquidity and capital resources cna financial cash flows cnas primary operating cash flow sources are premiums and investment income from its insurance subsidiaries. cnas primary operating cash flow uses are payments for claims, policy benefits and operating expenses, including interest expense on corporate debt. additionally, cash may be paid or received for income taxes.
for 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion for each of 2015 and 2014. in 2015, cash provided by operating activities reflected lower premiums collected and decreased receipts relating to returns on limited partnerships, offset by lower net claim payments. in 2014, cash provided by operating activities reflected increased receipts relating to returns on limited partnerships and lower net claim payments, substantially offset by increased tax payments. net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in 2013. in 2013, cna contributed $75 million to the cna retirement plan.
cash flows from investing activities include the purchase and disposition of available-for-sale financial instruments and may include the purchase and sale of businesses, land, buildings, equipment and other assets not generally held for resale.
net cash used by investing activities was $372 million for 2015, as compared with $918 million and $898 million for 2014 and 2013. the cash flow from investing activities is affected by various factors such as the anticipated payment of claims, financing activity, asset/liability management and individual security buy and sell decisions made in the normal course of portfolio management.
cash flows from financing activities may include proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, outflows for shareholder dividends or repayment of debt and outlays to reacquire equity instruments. net cash used by financing activities was $807 million, $519 million and $264 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013. cash used by financing activities reflected an increased special shareholder dividend in 2015 as compared to 2014. additionally, in 2014, cna issued $550 million of senior notes.
liquidity cna believes that its present cash flows from operations, investing activities and financing activities are sufficient to fund its current and expected working capital and debt obligation needs and cna does not expect this to change in the near term. there are currently no amounts outstanding under cnas $250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and no borrowings outstanding through cnas membership in the federal home loan bank of chicago (fhlbc).

cna has an effective registration statement on form s-3 registering the future sale of an unlimited amount of its debt and equity securities.
dividends dividends of $3.00 per share of cnas common stock, including a special dividend of $2.00 per share, were declared and paid in 2015. on february 5, 2016, cnas board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and a special dividend of $2.00 per share, payable march 9, 2016 to shareholders of record on february 22, 2016. the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of cnas board of directors and will depend on many factors, including cnas earnings, financial condition, business needs, and regulatory constraints.
ratings ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. cnas insurance company subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies and these ratings reflect the rating agencys opinion of the insurance companys financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating. one or more of these agencies could take action in the future to change the ratings of cnas insurance subsidiaries.
the table below reflects the various group ratings issued by a.m. best company (a.m. best), moodys investors service, inc. (moodys) and standard & poors (s&p). the table also includes the ratings for cna senior debt.

diamond offshore cash and investments totaled $130 million at december 31, 2015, compared to $250 million at december 31, 2014. in 2015, diamond offshore paid regular cash dividends totaling $69 million. on february 8, 2016, diamond offshore announced that its board of directors was discontinuing its quarterly regular cash dividend.
cash provided by operating activities was $736 million in 2015, compared to $993 million in 2014, a decrease of $257 million, primarily due to a decrease in cash receipts from contract drilling services of $445 million, partially offset by a $144 million net decrease in cash payments for contract drilling and general and administrative expenses, including personnel-related, maintenance, mobilization and other rig operating costs and lower income taxes paid, net of refunds of $44 million. the decline in cash receipts from and cash payments related to contract drilling services both reflect an aggregate decline in diamond offshores contract drilling operations as well as its efforts to control costs. the $73 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher cash payments related to contract drilling expenses of $77 million and higher interest payments of $51 million on senior notes.

diamond offshore is currently obligated under a construction agreement for the ultra-deepwater semisubmersible, the ocean greatwhite. construction continues with delivery expected in mid-2016. the estimated total project cost, including shipyard costs, capital spares, commissioning, project management and shipyard supervision, but excluding capitalized interest, is $764 million, of which $242 million has been incurred as of december 31, 2015.
for 2016, diamond offshore has budgeted approximately $675 million for capital expenditures of which approximately $525 million is expected to be spent on completion of the construction of the ocean greatwhite. diamond offshores 2016 capital spending program also includes an estimated $150 million for ongoing capital maintenance and replacement programs.
depending on market and other conditions, diamond offshore may purchase shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. diamond offshore did not purchase any shares of its outstanding common stock in 2015. during 2014, diamond offshore purchased 1.9 million shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $88 million.
diamond offshores credit agreement provides for a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, to be used for general corporate purposes, and maturing in 2020. as of december 31, 2015, diamond offshore had no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement and is in compliance with all covenant requirements.
as of december 31, 2015, diamond offshore had $287 million in commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.86% and a weighted average remaining term of 5.8 days that was repaid in january of 2016. as of february 16, 2016, diamond offshore had no commercial paper notes outstanding.
during february of 2016, diamond offshore borrowed $305 million in eurodollar loans under the credit agreement, which bear interest at 1.6% and will mature on february 29, 2016. as of february 16, 2016, diamond offshore had an additional $1.2 billion available under the credit agreement.
as of december 31, 2015, diamond offshore had an aggregate $2.0 billion in long-term, unsecured senior notes outstanding, of which $500 million will mature in 2019 and the remainder will mature at various times beginning in 2023.
in january of 2016, moodys investor service, inc. (moodys) announced that it would be reviewing diamond offshores long-term corporate credit and unsecured debt rating and short-term credit rating for commercial paper, which are currently baa2 and prime-2, for possible downgrade. diamond offshores current corporate credit rating is bbb+ and its short-term credit rating is a2 for standard & poors (s&p). market conditions and other factors, many of which are outside of diamond offshores control, could cause its credit ratings to be lowered. a downgrade in diamond offshores credit ratings could adversely impact its cost of issuing additional debt and the amount of additional debt that it could issue and could restrict diamond offshores access to its commercial paper program and capital markets and its ability to raise additional debt or rollover existing maturities. as a consequence, diamond offshore may not be able to issue additional debt in amounts and/or with terms that it considers to be reasonable. one or more of these occurrences could limit diamond offshores ability to pursue other business opportunities.
certain of diamond offshores international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by diamond foreign asset company (dfac), and as a result of diamond offshores intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of dfac and its foreign subsidiaries to finance diamond offshores foreign activities, diamond offshore does not expect such earnings to be available for distribution to its stockholders or to finance its domestic activities. to the extent available, diamond offshore expects to utilize the operating cash flows generated by and cash reserves of dfac, and the operating cash flows available to and cash reserves of diamond offshore drilling, inc. to meet each entitys respective working capital requirements and capital commitments. diamond offshore, may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. diamond offshores ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on its results of operations, current financial condition, current credit ratings, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control.

in may 2015, boardwalk pipeline entered into an amended credit facility which increased the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion and extended the maturity date to may 26, 2020. as of february 16, 2016, boardwalk pipeline had outstanding borrowings of $470 million resulting in over $1.0 billion of available borrowing capacity and is in compliance with all covenant requirements under the credit facility.
boardwalk pipeline anticipates that for 2016 its existing capital resources, including the revolving credit facility, a subordinated loan agreement with a subsidiary of the company and cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to fund its operations, including its planned capital expenditures. the subordinated loan agreement provides borrowings of up to $300 million with a draw period through december 31, 2016 and matures in july of 2024, subject to certain mandatory pre-payment requirements. boardwalk pipeline may seek to access the capital markets to fund some or all capital expenditures for future growth projects or acquisitions, or to repay or refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness, a significant amount of which matures in the next five years.
most of boardwalk pipelines senior unsecured debt is rated by independent credit rating agencies. boardwalk pipelines credit ratings affect its ability to access the public and private debt markets, as well as the terms and the cost of borrowings. the ability to satisfy financing requirements or fund planned growth capital expenditures will depend upon boardwalk pipelines future operating performance and the ability to access the capital markets, which are affected by economic factors in its industry as well as other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond boardwalk pipelines control. the table below reflects the various group ratings issued by s&p, moodys and fitch ratings, inc. (fitch) for boardwalk pipelines senior unsecured notes and that of its operating subsidiaries having outstanding rated debt as of february 17, 2016.

investments investment activities of non-insurance subsidiaries primarily include investments in fixed income securities, including short term investments. the parent company portfolio also includes equity securities, including short sales and derivative instruments, and investments in limited partnerships. these types of investments generally present greater volatility, less liquidity and greater risk than fixed income investments and are included within results of operations  corporate and other.
we enter into short sales and invest in certain derivative instruments that are used for asset and liability management activities, income enhancements to our portfolio management strategy and to benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. if such movements do not occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur. monitoring procedures include senior management review of daily detailed reports of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to ensure that open positions are consistent with our portfolio strategy.
85
credit exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value of the derivative instruments recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. we mitigate the risk of non-performance by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying derivatives to multiple counterparties. we occasionally require collateral from our derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure and the credit rating of the counterparty.

net investment income after tax and noncontrolling interests decreased $131 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. the decrease was driven by limited partnership investments, which returned 3.0% in 2015 as compared with 9.7% in the prior year. income from fixed maturity securities decreased by $30 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests, driven by a $22 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests, change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle to better reflect the yield on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions. additionally, income from fixed maturity securities decreased due to lower reinvestment rates, partially offset by favorable changes in estimates for prepayments for asset-backed securities. additional information on the accounting change is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8.
net investment income after tax and noncontrolling interests decreased $95 million in 2014 as compared with 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by limited partnerships, which produced a rate of return of 9.7% as compared with 18.3% in the prior year. this was partially offset by an increase in fixed maturity securities investment income, after tax and noncontrolling interests, due to additional investments in tax-exempt securities.

duration a primary objective in the management of the investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to corresponding liabilities and respective liquidity needs. cnas views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions and the domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. cna also continually monitors exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on its views of a specific issuer or industry sector.
a further consideration in the management of the investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. for portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long term in nature, cna segregates investments for asset/liability management purposes. the segregated investments support the long term care and structured settlement liabilities in the life & group non-core business.

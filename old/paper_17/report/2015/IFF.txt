item 1a.   risk factors.
we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business. some of these risks may cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate. below are certain important operational and strategic risks that could adversely affect our business. how we react to material future developments, as well as how our competitors react to those developments, could also affect our future results.
our business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer.
the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational and specialized flavor, fragrance and cosmetic ingredients companies, as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors, fragrances or cosmetic ingredients. in the flavors industry, we also face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings. some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product sub-segments, while others participate in many of our product sub-segments. in addition, some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can. consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks. as we are new to cosmetic ingredients, we may face greater competition-related risks in this industry than with our core historic flavor and fragrances business.
competition in our business is based on innovation, product quality, regulatory compliance, pricing, quality of customer service, the support provided by marketing and application groups, and understanding of consumers. it is difficult for us to predict the timing, scale and success of our competitors' actions in these areas. the discovery and development of new flavor and fragrance materials, protection of the company's intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are important issues in our ability to compete in our business. increased competition by existing or future competitors, including aggressive price competition, could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an adverse impact on sales and profitability.
during 2015, our 25 largest customers accounted for 52% of our sales, and sales to our largest customer accounted for 12% of our sales in each of the last three fiscal years. disruption of sales to this customer or any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results.
large multinational customers, and increasingly, mid-sized customers are unilaterally limiting the number of their suppliers or rationalizing the number of products that they offer to increase their margins and profitability. as part of these initiatives, these customers are creating "core lists" of suppliers and giving these "core lists" suppliers priority for new or modified products. recently, these customers are making inclusion on their "core lists" contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable commercial terms which may adversely affect our margins. these, and other profitability initiatives being pursued by our customers, reduce the market opportunity for which we compete and subject the volume and pricing of the remaining suppliers to downward pressure. to compete more successfully in this environment, we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers' needs, deliver supplies that contribute to our customers' profitability, provide effective service and offer competitive cost-in-use solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on certain "core lists" and our share of our customers' purchases. if we are unable to do so, it could adversely impact our future results of operations.
we may not be able to successfully identify and complete sufficient acquisitions to meet our vision 2020 strategy, and even if we are able to do so, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.
as part of our new vision 2020 strategy, we intend to add between $500 million and $1.0 billion of sales growth through acquisitions within the flavors and fragrances industries and adjacencies. during 2015, we negotiated and closed two acquisitions which align with this strategic objective. specifically, in may 2015, we completed the acquisition of ottens
12
flavors, a flavor supplier and developer and in july 2015, we completed the acquisition of lucas meyer cosmetics, a developer, manufacturer and marketer of cosmetic active ingredients.
identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or complete acquisitions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all. even if we complete an acquisition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition. our recent acquisitions have required, and any similar future transactions may also require, significant efforts and expenditures, including with respect to integrating the acquired business with our historical business. we may encounter unexpected difficulties, or incur unexpected costs, in connection with acquisition activities and integration efforts, which include:
•   diversion of management attention from managing our historical core business;
•   potential disruption of our historical core business of the acquired business;
•   the strain on, and need to continue to expand, our existing operational, technical, financial and administrative infrastructure;
•   the challenges related to the lack of experience in operating in the geographical or product markets of the acquired business;
•   challenges in controlling additional costs and expenses in connection with and as a result of the acquisition;
•   the difficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures or in integrating systems and controls;
•   difficulties in anticipating and responding to actions that may be taken by competitors in response to the acquisitions;
•   potential loss of key employees, customers, suppliers or other partners of the acquired business; and
•   the assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses.
if any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated for any of the reasons noted above or otherwise, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
the failure of key information technology systems or a breach of our information security may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation.
we rely on information technology systems, including some managed by third-party providers, to conduct business and support our business processes, including product formulas, product development, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intra-company communications throughout the world. these systems may be susceptible to disruptions or outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, natural disasters, cyber attacks and similar events, or due to the poor performance of third-party providers. effective response to such disruptions will require effort and diligence on the part of our employees and third-party providers to avoid any adverse impact to our business. in addition, our systems and proprietary data stored electronically may be vulnerable to computer viruses, cybercrime, computer hacking and similar information security breaches, which in turn could result in the unauthorized release or misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our business (including, but not limited to, the trade secrets upon which we rely to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations), employees, or customers, and disrupt our operations. depending on their nature and scope, these threats could potentially lead to improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data or product non-compliance. the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our sales, subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation.
the industries in which our customers operate are expanding and becoming increasingly decentralized, and if we and/or our customers are unable to adjust, our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected.
our customers include large food and beverage companies, which operate in highly competitive industries and rely on continued consumer demand for their products. in recent years many of our customers have faced growing competition from mid-size regional companies and companies focused on niche-product categories driving and accelerating product innovation. consequently, the food and beverage industry is expanding and becoming increasingly decentralized. if our customers fail to adequately address the challenges pertaining to this expansion and decentralization of business, it may adversely affect their operations or financial performance, and could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. if our global customers'
13
market shares continue to erode and we are unable to gain market share with small and mid-sized customers in this evolved environment, our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected.
we have made investments in and are expanding our business into emerging markets, which exposes us to certain risks.
as part of our growth strategy, we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence, sales organization and product offerings in these markets, and we expect to continue to focus on expanding our business in these markets. in addition to the currency and international operation risks described below, our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks. emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly. as a result, decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy. in addition, emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights, exchange controls, unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes, subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency. in conducting our business, we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country. accordingly, we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in customs and tax regimes that may have significant negative impacts on our financial condition and operating results.
we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers' needs, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
our ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth in line with our vision 2020 strategy largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers' needs, and ultimately appeal to consumers. innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products. we cannot be certain that we will successfully achieve our innovation goals, such as the development of new molecules, new and expanded delivery systems and other technologies. we currently spend approximately 8% of our sales on research and development; however, such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to successfully develop products that meet our customers' specifications, can be delivered at an acceptable cost in use and are accepted by the targeted consumer market. furthermore, there may be significant lag times from the time we incur r&d costs to the time that these r&d costs may result in increased revenue. consequently, even when we "win" a project, our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer, economic and other risks that are outside of our control, including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product, the level of promotional support for the launch, poor performance of our third-party vendors, anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands, or disruptive innovations by competitors.
increasing awareness of health and wellness are driving changes in the consumer products industry, and if we are unable to react in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.
we must continually anticipate and react, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to changes in consumer preferences and demands, including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency with respect to product ingredients. consumers, especially in developed economies such as the united states and western europe, are shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to "all natural," healthier alternatives. in addition, there has been a growing demand by consumers and governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand, including by voluntarily providing product-specific fragrance ingredients disclosure. these two trends could affect the types and volumes of our flavors and fragrances that our customers include in their product offerings. if we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.
we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborations, joint ventures or partnerships, and such arrangements may not lead to development or commercialization of products, which may limit our ability to execute our vision 2020 strategy and adversely affect our future growth.
from time to time and in line with our new vision 2020 strategy, we may evaluate and enter into collaborations, joint ventures or partnerships to enhance our research and development efforts. our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners' abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult, time-consuming to negotiate, document and implement. we may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we choose to enter into such arrangements, and the terms of the arrangements may not be favorable to us. additionally, collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner, or at all. if we are
14
unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements, it could limit our ability to execute our vision 2020 strategy and adversely affect our future growth.
the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations.
we have significant operations outside the united states, the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into united states dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the exchange rates between these currencies and the united states dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future. changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the united states dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales, profitability, assets and/or liabilities. for example, the weakening of the euro and several emerging market currencies in 2015 resulted in approximately $33 million impact on operating profit versus 2014. additionally, volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows or liquidity. although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities, we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
our international operations are subject to regulatory, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues, cash flows or financial position.
we operate on a global basis, with manufacturing and sales facilities in the united states, europe, africa, the middle east, latin america, and greater asia. during 2015, 77% of our net sales were to customers outside the united states and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations. as a result, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations. these risks, which can vary substantially by location, are also described in many of the risk factors in this section and include the following:
•   governmental laws, regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic conditions, such as increases in taxes, austerity measures that may impact consumer spending, monetary policies that may impact inflation rates, currency fluctuations and sustainability of resources;
•   changes in environmental, health and safety regulations, such as the continued implementation of the european union's reach regulations, and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations;
•   the imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, which could adversely affect our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our flavors or fragrances to surrounding markets;
•   risks and costs arising from language and cultural differences;
•   changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which we operate, including the risk of expropriation or nationalization, and the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that we generate in these countries;
•   risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, bribery and corruption, and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate;
•   difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel;
•   national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which we operate; or
•   the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights.
these factors may increase in importance as we expand our operations in emerging markets as part of our growth strategy, and the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.
15
volatility and challenging economic conditions may adversely affect demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances (including cosmetic active ingredients) may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth.
our flavors and fragrances (including cosmetic active ingredients) are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world. historically, demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances (including cosmetic active ingredients) was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs, population growth, an expanding global middle-class and general economic growth, especially in emerging markets. the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth. while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering, the ongoing global recessionary economic environment in europe has, and may in the near future, increase unemployment and underemployment, decrease salaries and wage rates, increase inflation or result in other market-wide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets.
in addition, growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels. reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances (including cosmetic active ingredients), or order cancellations. for example, recent challenging economic conditions in china and latin america, which culminated in the weakening of the chinese yuan, brazilian real and argentinian peso, have undermined consumer confidence and resulted in our customers throughout the emerging markets taking a more cautious approach to managing their inventory.
the timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers' discretion. customers may cancel, reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice. significant cancellations, reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results.
it is currently anticipated that these challenging economic conditions will continue during 2016. to the extent that the volatility in global economic conditions continues, our sales, profitability and overall operating results could be adversely affected.
our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business. significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals.
attracting, developing, and retaining talented employees, including our perfumers and flavorists, is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace. competition for these employees can be intense. the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy. however, we may not be able to attract and retain such employees in the future. if we experience significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention, our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected.
failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close, relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels, which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth.
our business operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment, including air emissions, sewage discharges, the use of hazardous materials, waste disposal practices and clean-up of existing environmental contamination. failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us, including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, liability for damages and negative publicity. if we are unable to meet production requirements, we can lose customer orders, which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply. for example, in 2015 chinese authorities notified us of compliance issues pertaining to the emission of odors from several of our plants in china and, consequently, our flavors facility in china was temporarily idled and another facility was required to modify its production schedule. as a result of these issues, we invested approximately $6.5 million in odor-abatement equipment at these facilities and have approved a new capital project of approximately $45 million to construct a second flavors manufacturing facility in china. such idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated. if these non-compliance issues reoccur in china or occur or in any other jurisdiction, we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations, close a plant, or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis, and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected.
our ongoing optimization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate, and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies.
16
as part of our strategy, we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth and technology needs. many of our facilities are located in close proximity to our customers in order to minimize both our customers' and our own costs. however, we may not have sufficient demand to utilize all of our production capacity and may be required to ship excess products to other regions in which we operate, which will increase our costs and decrease our margins. to operate more efficiently and control costs, from time to time we also execute rationalization activities, which include manufacturing facility consolidations. for example, we are in the midst of relocating our ingredients facility in hangzhou, china and constructing a new flavors site in indonesia. we have also initiated a study regarding our existing footprint and manufacturing capabilities that serve the indian market. the spending associated with these projects may result in capital spending above previous expectations. our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements from these activities may be affected by a number of factors and may pose significant risks, including:
•   the risk that we may be unable to integrate successfully the relocated manufacturing operations;
•   the risk that we may be unable to effectively reduce overhead, coordinate management and integrate and retain employees of the relocated manufacturing operations;
•   the risk that we may face difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;
•   potential strains on our personnel, systems and resources and diversion of attention from other priorities; and
•   unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the relocated manufacturing operations.
furthermore, our rationalization and consolidation actions may not be as effective as we anticipate, and we may fail to realize the cost savings we expect from these actions. actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these activities may vary materially from our estimates, and these activities may require cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of budgeted amounts, which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins.
volatility and increases in the price of raw materials, energy and transportation could harm our profits.
we use many different raw materials for our business, including essential oils, extracts and concentrates derived from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and other botanicals, animal products, raw fruits, organic chemicals and petroleum-based chemicals. while raw material costs have been relatively stable during 2015, historically, we have experienced a considerable amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases. availability and pricing of these natural products can be impacted by crop size and quality, weather, alternative land use, and other factors which we cannot control.
if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our fragrance or flavor products to offset raw material and other input cost increases, or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected. increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume, and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
similarly, commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, and other world events. as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control, if the cost of energy, shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers, our profit margins would be adversely affected. furthermore, increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients, which could have an adverse long-term impact on our results of operations.
to mitigate our sourcing risk, we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items. however, if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials, our margins could be adversely affected.
our reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in a disruption to our business and may adversely affect our financial results.
17
for certain raw materials, we rely on a limited number of suppliers and we may not have readily available alternatives. if we are unable to maintain our supplier arrangements and relationships and are unable to obtain the quantity, quality and price levels needed for our business, or if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress, we could experience disruptions in production and our financial results could be adversely affected.
if we are unable to maintain the integrity of our raw materials, supply chain and finished goods, it may result in regulatory non-compliance, litigation costs, and harm to our reputation, all of which may adversely impact sales and our results of operations.
the development, manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed, manufactured and sold. in addition, we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies. we use a variety of strategies, methodologies and tools to (i) identify current product standards, (ii) assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity, (iii) monitor internal and external performance and (iv) test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process non-compliance.
gaps in our operational processes could adversely affect the quality of our finished products and result in a regulatory non-compliance event. if a product non-compliance event were to go undetected, it could subject us to customer claims, recalls, penalties, litigation costs and settlements, remediation costs or loss of sales. as our flavors, fragrances and cosmetic actives are used as ingredients in many products meant for human use or consumption, these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level. such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity, recalls and potential consumer litigation. furthermore, adverse publicity about our products, including concerns about product safety or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships, as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation.
a disruption in our operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.
as a company engaged in research and development, manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems,disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites, product quality control, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control. while we have research and development and manufacturing facilities throughout the world, many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our facilities are the sole source of a specific ingredient or product. if our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted, the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial, which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins, operating results and future growth.
our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory and/or working capital balances.
we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life, expected sourcing levels, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our product/sales mix. efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success, financial returns and profitability. to be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product/sales mix to meet our customers' demands, without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results. if our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels, customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory, which can adversely impact our financial results. additionally, we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage. if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage, our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected.
we sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under "factoring" agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers. the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods. should we choose not to participate, or if these programs were no longer available, it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends.
18
we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act or similar u.s. or foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
the global nature of our business, the significance of our international revenue and our focus on emerging markets create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage. in addition, u.s. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. under the fcpa, u.s. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. as such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the united states and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.
we operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions, such as china, india, brazil and africa, which pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues. in certain jurisdictions, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. from time to time, we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances, control testing and compliance reviews, and take remedial actions, when appropriate, to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations. detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or similar laws is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management. we could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies. any allegations of non-compliance with the fcpa or similar laws could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction over the near term, including interruptions of business or loss of third-party relationships, which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with the fcpa or similar laws could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, significant fines, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation.
our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.
we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights. we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations, as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property. from time to time, a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights, or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from third party assertions of invalidity, infringement or misappropriation or other claims. any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights. any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. for those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets, this litigation could result in even higher costs, and potentially the loss of certain rights, since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making, using or selling our products or processes. the ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our proprietary flavor formulations.
for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents, we cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not later be opposed, invalidated, or circumvented. in addition, even if such rights are obtained in the united states, the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights, or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights, it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by (i) reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights, (ii) increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or (iii) limiting the volume, if any, of such products that we can sell.
our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation.
from time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims and litigation, including claims related to intellectual property, product liability, environmental matters and indirect taxes. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation. in addition, we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in the number of claims or require an
19
increase in the amount accrued for any such claims, or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued. in addition, if we were found liable, we could be subject to certain indemnification claims. there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices.
the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods. changes in government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements.
the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets, and interest rates. funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. if the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations, we could be required to make larger contributions. the equity markets can be very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity.
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors. in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, or expected health care costs, our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.
any future impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets may adversely impact our profitability.
a significant portion of our assets consists of long-lived assets, including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities, and intangible assets and goodwill. as of december 31, 2015, we had recorded $1.2 billion of intangible assets and goodwill including goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisitions. long-lived assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. additionally, goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least annually. indicators such as underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, changes in the company's strategy for its overall business or use of acquired assets, unexpected negative industry or economic trends, decreased market capitalization relative to net book values, unanticipated competitive activities, change in consumer demand, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired. to the extent any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, whether due to internal or external factors, the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges. our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets or goodwill occur.
changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new united states or international tax legislation, or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results.
we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions, cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries. these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results. many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction, challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential non-compliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where non-compliance is determined. there can be no assurance that a governmental authority will not challenge these policies more aggressively in the future or, if challenged, that we will prevail. we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing.
we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate, and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the
20
countries in which we operate. the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made.
in addition, a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multinational companies and, in the european union ("eu"), the tax policies of certain eu member states. one of these efforts has been led by the oecd, an international association of 34 countries including the united states, which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions in member countries. since 2013, the european commission ("ec") has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of eu member states with respect to specific multinational corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with eu rules on state aid, as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain eu member states. under eu law, selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid. if the ec determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions, the tax authorities of the affected eu member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling. in late 2015 and early 2016, the ec declared that tax rulings by tax authorities in luxembourg, the netherlands and belgium did not comply with the eu state aid restrictions. if the ec were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the eu member states in which we are subject to taxation, we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities.
our operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations.
the availability of raw materials and energy supplies fluctuate in markets throughout the world. climate change may also affect the availability and price of key raw materials, including natural products used in the manufacture of our products. in order to mitigate the risk of price increases and shortages, our purchasers have developed various sourcing strategies, including multiple suppliers, inventory management systems, various geographic suppliers and long-term agreements to mitigate risk.
in addition to market forces, there are various regulatory efforts relating to climate change that may increase the cost of raw materials, particularly energy used to operate our facilities, that could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the potential government regulation of certain of our product development initiatives is uncertain, and we may be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with applicable regulations.
as part of our ingredients research program, we seek to collaborate with research institutions and companies throughout the world, including biotechnology companies. however, it is unclear whether any of our product developments will be classified as genetically modified food products subject to regulation as a biotechnology product. the manufacture of biotechnology products is subject to applicable current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) regulations as prescribed by the food and drug administration and the applicable standards prescribed by european commission and the competent authorities of european union member states and to other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. compliance with these regulations can be expensive and time consuming. such regulation could also subject us to requirements for labeling and traceability, which may cause our customers to avoid our affected products and seek our competitors' products. this may result in our inability to realize any benefit from our investment and have an adverse effect on our operating results.

overview company background we create, manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances (including cosmetic active ingredients) that are used in the food, beverage, personal care and household products industries either in the form of compounds or individual ingredients, including cosmetic active ingredients. our flavors and fragrance compounds combine a number of ingredients that are blended, mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our flavorists and perfumers.
flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and, as such, play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used. as a leading creator of flavors, we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. while we are a global leader, our flavors business is more regional in nature, with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences. our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four end-use categories: (1) savory, (2) beverages, (3) sweet and (4) dairy.
we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world's finest perfumes and best-known consumer products, within fabric care, home care, personal wash, hair care and toiletries products. our fragrances business consists of fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients. our fragrance compounds are defined into broad categories, (1) fine fragrances and (2) consumer fragrances. consumer fragrances consists of five end-use categories of products: (1) fabric care, (2) home care, (3) personal wash, (4) hair care and (5) toiletries. in addition, fragrance ingredients, that are used internally and sold to third parties, including customers and competitors, for use in preparation of compounds, and cosmetic active ingredients, which consist of active and functional ingredients, are included in the fragrances business unit.
the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds that are used in consumer products. the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings, texturizers, spices, enzymes, certain food-related commodities, fortified products and cosmetic active ingredients. the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently, primarily as a result of an increase in demand for, as well as an increase in the variety of, consumer products containing flavors and fragrances. in 2014, the flavors and fragrances market, in which we compete, was estimated by management to be at least $18 billion and is forecasted to grow to approximately $21.6 billion by 2019, primarily driven by expected growth in emerging markets; however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data. we estimate the market size for cosmetic active ingredients to be approximately $1.5 billion as of 2015. we, together with the other top three companies, are estimated to represent approximately two-thirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances sub-segment of the broader market.
development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources, including requests from our customers, who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product, or as a result of
31
internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program. our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance. it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers, our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product.
2015 overview during the third quarter of 2015, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of lucas meyer cosmetics, a business of unipex group, ("lucas meyer") for approximately euro 284.0 million ($312.0 million). (the total shares acquired include shares effectively acquired pursuant to put and call option agreements). this acquisition did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income. the acquisition strengthened and expanded fragrance ingredients.
during the second quarter of 2015, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of henry h. ottens manufacturing co., inc. ("ottens flavors") for $198.9 million. the acquisition did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the acquisition strengthened our flavors market position in the targeted north american market.
our 25 largest customers accounted for 52% of total sales in 2015; this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years. sales to our largest customer across all end-use categories accounted for 12% of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years. a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers' core supplier lists, which provides opportunities to win new business. we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and flavors.
sales in 2015 declined 2% on a reported basis but increased 5% on a currency neutral basis (which excludes the effects of changes in currency), with the effects of acquisitions contributing approximately 2% to both reported and currency neutral basis growth rates. flavors achieved currency neutral growth of 6%, including approximately half of the growth coming from acquisitions. fragrances achieved currency neutral growth of 4% in 2015, including approximately a quarter of the growth coming from acquisitions. the currency neutral growth of 3%, excluding acquisitions, reflects new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business principally driven by our customers' product line rationalization and inventory management efforts. in addition, our flavors business was negatively impacted by volume erosion in north america (noam) as well as weak demand and lost business in china (principally associated with facility issues). additionally, fragrance ingredients sales were up 2%, which was driven entirely by the inclusion of acquisitions. overall, our 2015 results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 51% of total sales and experienced 5% currency neutral growth in 2015. from a geographic perspective, all regions delivered currency neutral growth on a consolidated basis in 2015; led by latin america (la) with 9% currency neutral sales growth.
the year 2014 included an extra week of activity, due to the timing of our fiscal year-end (as discussed in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements). the impact of this week was not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014.

financial performance overview reported sales for 2015 decreased 2% year-over-year (including approximately 2% growth from acquisitions). we continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end-use product categories and geographies and had currency neutral sales growth in all four regions and in consumer fragrances and flavor compounds. both flavors and fragrances benefited from new win performance (net of losses) and the effect of acquisitions, that were partially offset by volume erosion on existing business principally driven by our customers' product line rationalization and inventory management efforts. in addition, our flavors business was negatively impacted by volume erosion in noam as well as weak demand and lost business in china (principally associated with facility issues). exchange rate variations represented a 7% decrease in year-over-year sales. the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in u.s. dollars versus local currencies. currency neutral sales growth, including acquisitions, was 5% in 2015. we saw good currency neutral sales growth during each quarter of 2015, despite the impact of volume erosion on existing business. we believe that market conditions and the macro-economic environment will continue to be challenging in many markets in 2016. this lower growth environment combined with a stronger u.s. dollar and the reset of the incentive compensation program is expected to pressure our currency neutral operating profit growth and, consequently, we expect currency neutral operating profit growth in 2016 to be mid single-digits, including acquisitions.
33
on a long-term basis, we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our long-term strategic goals, albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty. we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income, improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers' businesses.
gross margin increased 60 basis points (bps) year-over-year. included in 2015 was $7.9 million of acquisition-related inventory "step-up" costs and costs associated with operational improvement initiatives, compared to $7.6 million of costs related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold and operational improvement initiatives included in 2014. excluding these items, gross margin increased 60 bps compared to the prior year period. the increase was principally driven by productivity initiatives. we ended 2015 in a relatively benign raw material cost environment. we believe that we will continue to see higher prices on certain categories (such as naturals including citrus and vanilla) that will be offset by benefits associated with oil-based derivatives that are expected to continue in 2016. we continue to seek improvements in our margins through operational performance, cost reduction efforts and mix enhancement.
operating profit decreased $4.0 million to $588.3 million (19.5% of sales) in 2015 compared to $592.3 million (19.2% of sales) in 2014. included in 2015 were acquisition related costs of $18.3 million, the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case of $10.5 million, accelerated contingent consideration payments of $7.2 million, restructuring and other charges, net of $7.6 million and operational improvement initiative costs of $1.1 million, compared to operational improvement initiative costs of $2.5 million, restructuring and other charges, net of $1.3 million and $5.1 million of accelerated depreciation in 2014. excluding these charges, adjusted operating profit was $612.1 million (20.2% of sales) for 2015 versus $601.3 million (19.5% of sales) for 2014. foreign currency changes had an unfavorable impact on operating profit of approximately 6% in 2015.
cash flows from operations were $433.6 million or 14.3% of sales in 2015 as compared to cash flows from operations of $518.4 million, or 16.8% of sales, during 2014. the decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 is principally related to the impact of higher pension contributions, increased core working capital requirements (trade receivables, inventories and accounts payable), and increased requirements related to various operating items (including taxes, employee benefits and prepaids).
our capital spend was $101.0 million (3.3% of sales) during 2015. given our intent to construct a new flavors facility in china, the continuation of our indonesia project and carryover payments from 2015, we expect that capital spending in 2016 will be approximately 5% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities).

cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses; raw materials generally constitute 70% of the total. r&d expenses relate to the development of new and improved molecules and technologies, technical product support and compliance with governmental regulations. s&a expenses include expenses necessary to support our commercial activities and administrative expenses principally associated with staff groups that support our overall operating activities.
2015 in comparison to 2014
sales sales for 2015 totaled $3.0 billion, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. excluding currency impacts, sales increased 5%. the currency neutral growth reflects new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business principally driven by our customers' product line rationalization and inventory management efforts. in addition, our flavors business was negatively impacted by volume erosion in north america (noam) as well as weak demand and lost business in china (principally associated with facility issues). on both a reported and currency neutral basis, the effect of acquisitions was approximately 2% to net sales amounts. in addition, fragrance ingredients sales
35
were up 2% on a currency neutral basis. overall organic currency neutral growth includes 5% growth from emerging markets and 1% from developed markets.
flavors business unit flavors sales in 2015 decreased 1% on a reported basis but increased 6% on a currency neutral basis versus the prior year period. acquisitions accounted for approximately half of the net sales growth on a currency neutral basis. overall growth was primarily due to mid single-digit growth in beverage combined with high single-digit growth in dairy and low single-digit growth in savory. regionally, the flavors business delivered currency neutral growth across all regions, led by la at 16% driven by double-digit gains in beverage, savory and dairy. sales growth in ga of 2% was led by low single-digit gains in savory and dairy, which more than offset low single-digit declines in sweet. sales growth in eame of 4% was driven by mid single-digit gains in savory and beverage. noam sales growth of 11% was primarily driven by high double-digit growth in sweet and dairy and double-digit growth in beverage. eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region. globally, flavors growth was led by mid single-digit growth in emerging markets. overall, emerging markets represented approximately 52% of total flavors sales.
fragrances business unit fragrances sales in 2015 declined 3% on a reported basis and increased 4% on a currency neutral basis. acquisitions accounted for approximately one quarter of the currency neutral sales growth. year-over-year, 2015 currency neutral sales performance was led by double-digit growth in fabric care, high single-digit growth in home care, mid single-digit growth in hair care and low single-digit growth in fragrance ingredients and fine fragrance. currency neutral growth within the regions was led by eame at 7% reflecting double-digit gains in the fabric care and mid single-digit growth in fine fragrance and fragrance ingredients. la experienced currency neutral sales growth of 6% reflecting double-digit gains in fabric care, home care and hair care categories as well as low single-digit gains in fragrance ingredients, which offset mid single-digit declines in fine fragrance. ga had currency neutral sales growth of 3% reflecting high single-digit gains in fragrance ingredients and mid single-digit gains in fabric care. noam currency neutral sales declined 2% reflecting double-digit declines in toiletries, high single-digit declines in fragrance ingredients and mid single-digit declines in fine fragrance which more than offset mid to high single-digit gains in home care and fabric care. overall, emerging markets represented 49% of total fragrances sales.

(1)   currency neutral sales growth is calculated by translating prior year sales at the exchange rates for the corresponding 2015 period.
•   noam flavors sales increased 11%, which included the impact of acquisitions, primarily reflects high double-digit growth in sweet and dairy and double-digit growth in beverage. total fragrances declined 2%, reflecting double-digit declines in toiletries, high single-digit declines in fragrance ingredients and mid single-digit declines in fine fragrance, which more than offset mid single-digit gains in home care and fabric care.
•   eame flavors currency neutral growth of 4% primarily reflects mid single-digit gains in savory and beverage. total fragrances currency neutral growth of 7% was driven by double-digit gains in the fabric care and mid single-digit growth in fine fragrance and fragrance ingredients, which included the impact of acquisitions.
•   la flavors currency neutral sales growth of 16% was driven by double-digit gains in beverage, savory and dairy. total fragrances currency neutral growth of 6% reflects double-digit gains in fabric care, home care and hair care categories as well as low single-digit gains in fragrance ingredients, which offset mid single-digit declines in fine fragrance.

•   ga flavors currency neutral sales growth of 2% was led by low single-digit gains in savory and dairy, which more than offset low single-digit declines in sweet. total fragrances currency neutral growth of 3% primarily reflects high single-digit gains in fragrance ingredients and mid single-digit gains in fabric care.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased 60 bps, on a reported and adjusted basis, to 55.3% in 2015 compared to 55.9% in 2014 (or 55.0% and 55.6% on an adjusted basis in 2015 and 2014, respectively). included in cost of goods sold was $7.9 million of acquisition related costs (including $6.8 million of inventory "step-up" costs) and operational improvement initiative costs in 2015 and $7.6 million of charges related to restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2014.
research and development (r&d)
r&d expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased slightly from the prior year period at 8.1% in 2015 compared to 8.2% in 2014. the decrease was principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense in 2015.
selling and administrative (s&a)
s&a, as a percentage of sales, increased 20 bps to 16.9% versus 16.7%. the increase in s&a expenses was principally due to acquisition-related expenses which were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and the reversal of the previously recorded provision related to the spanish capital tax case of $10.5 million.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs.

2015 severance and contingent consideration charges during the fourth quarter of 2015, we established a series of initiatives that are expected to streamline our management structure, simplify decision-making and accountability, better leverage and align our capabilities across the organization and improve efficiency of our global manufacturing and operations network. as a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $7.6 million, included in restructuring and other charges, net, related to severance and related costs pertaining to approximately 150 positions that will be affected. the total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately $10 million with the remaining charges relating principally to accelerated depreciation. the company expects to realize pre-tax savings of approximately $7-$9 million once fully implemented in the second half of 2017, half of which is expected to be realized in 2016.
separately, we recorded a charge of $7.2 million, included in selling and administrative expenses, associated with the acceleration from 2016 to 2015 of contingent consideration payments from the aromor acquisition that were triggered by certain of the management structure changes noted above.
fragrance ingredients rationalization - 2014
in 2014, we closed our fragrance ingredients manufacturing facility in augusta, georgia and consolidated production into other company facilities. in connection with this closure, we incurred charges of $13.8 million, consisting primarily of $10.3 million in accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, $2.2 million in personnel-related costs and $1.3 million in plant shutdown and other related costs. we recorded total charges of $7.4 million during 2013, consisting of $2.2 million of pre-tax charges related to severance included in restructuring and other charges, net and $5.2 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold. during 2014, we recorded $1.3 million of plant shutdown and other related costs included in restructuring and other charges, net as well as an additional $5.1 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold. as a result of this closure, 43 positions have been eliminated. during 2015, we recorded a net credit of $0.5 million principally related to the reversal of severance accruals.

flavors business unit flavors segment profit decreased $12.8 million to $318.5 million in 2015 (22.1% of sales) from $331.3 million (22.7% of sales) in the comparable 2014 period. the decrease in segment profit and profit margin was driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, scale up costs of new sites in turkey and indonesia and other one-off costs, including incremental operating costs associated with the china flavors facility. these costs were only partially offset by favorable volume growth, productivity initiatives, sales mix and a slight impact from the addition of ottens flavors.
fragrances business unit fragrances segment profit decreased $13.7 million to $321.8 million in 2015 (20.4% of sales), compared to $335.4 million (20.6% of sales) reported in 2014. the decrease in segment profit and profit margin was principally driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, which were partially offset by favorable volume growth, sales mix and a slight impact from the addition of lucas meyer.
global expenses global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and r&d and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. in 2015, global expenses were $28.2 million compared to $65.4 million during 2014. the decrease is principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of our cash flow hedging program.
interest expense in 2015, interest expense remained comparable with the prior year at $46.1 million. average cost of debt was 4.5% for the 2015 period compared to 4.9% in 2014.
other expense (income), net other expense (income), net decreased approximately $6.0 million to $3.2 million of expense in 2015 versus $2.8 million of income in 2014. this decrease is primarily driven by lower foreign exchange gains on working capital and lower mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation plan assets during 2015 compared to the 2014 period.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 22.2% in 2015 as compared to 24.5% in 2014. excluding the $2.6 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiatives, the $6.2 million benefit associated with acquisition related costs, the $10.5 million tax settlement received in 2015 due to favorable tax rulings in spain and another jurisdiction as well as the $2.9 million charge related to the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case, the adjusted tax rate for 2015 was 24.2%. excluding the $2.6 million tax benefit associated with the
38
pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs as well as the $3.8 million tax benefit related to the reserve reversal for the 2001 spanish dividend withholding tax case (as discussed in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements), the adjusted tax rate for 2014 was 25.3%. the year-over-year reduction reflects a benefit from lower cost of repatriation and loss provisions which were partially offset by mix of earnings.
2014 in comparison to 2013
sales sales for 2014 totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year on both a reported and currency neutral basis, with the acquisition of aromor adding approximately 1% to both reported and currency neutral basis amounts. the currency neutral growth reflected new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business. in addition, fragrance ingredients sales were up 18% (which includes the benefit of the aromor acquisition). overall currency neutral growth was driven by 6% growth in emerging markets.
flavors business unit in 2014, flavors sales increased 2% on a reported basis and 4% on a currency neutral basis versus 2013. the overall performance reflects new wins offset by volume erosion on existing business. overall high single-digit growth in beverage combined with low single-digit growth in savory and mid single-digit growth in dairy was partially offset by low single-digit declines in sweet. regionally, the flavors business delivered currency neutral growth in la, eame and ga, led by la, while sales declined in noam. sales in la were driven by high double-digit gains in beverage. sales in ga were led by mid single-digit gains in savory and sales in eame were driven by double-digit gains in beverage. the declines in noam were primarily driven by low single-digit declines in beverage and sweet, which were only partially offset by double-digit gains in dairy. eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region. globally, flavors growth was led by high single-digit growth in emerging markets. overall, emerging markets represented approximately 52% of total flavors sales.
fragrances business unit in 2014, the fragrances business was up 7% in both reported and currency neutral terms versus 2013. year-over-year, 2014 currency neutral sales performance was led by double-digit growth in fragrance ingredients, high single-digit growth in fabric care and mid single-digit growth in hair care categories, as well as low single-digit growth in fine fragrances. currency neutral growth within the regions was led by ga at 11% reflecting double-digit gains in the fabric care and fragrance ingredients. eame experienced currency neutral sales growth of 8% reflecting double-digit gains in fragrance ingredients and high single-digit gains in fabric care. la had currency neutral sales growth of 3% reflecting double-digit gains in hair care and personal wash. noam currency neutral sales increased 4% reflecting double-digit gains in home care and mid to high single-digit gains in fabric care and hair care categories that more than offset low single-digit declines in fragrance ingredients. overall, emerging markets represented 47% of total fragrances sales.

_______________________
(1)   currency neutral sales growth is calculated by translating prior year sales at the exchange rates for the corresponding 2014 period.
•   noam reported sales growth of 1% reflecting a decline of 1% in flavors as double-digit growth in dairy was more than offset by volume declines in sweet and beverage, and 4% growth in fragrances. consumer fragrances sales
39
were up 8% versus last year as new wins and volume gains in home care and fabric care were only partially offset by lower volumes on existing business in fragrance ingredients.
•   eame currency neutral growth reflects 4% growth in flavors primarily resulting from double-digit gains in beverages. this growth was mainly due to new wins within our emerging markets in the region, as well as volume increases. total fragrances growth of 8% was driven by double-digit growth in fragrance ingredients as well as high single-digit growth in fabric care.
•   la currency neutral sales growth of 7% was driven by double-digit gains in flavors, driven by beverage. total fragrances growth reflects double-digit gains in hair care and mid single-digit gains in fabric care.
•   ga delivered currency neutral sales growth of 6%, led by mid single-digit gains in savory. both consumer fragrances and fine fragrances experienced high single-digit growth led by double-digit growth in fabric care and high single-digit growth in fine fragrances. in addition, ga experienced fragrance ingredients currency neutral sales growth of 33%.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased 60 bps, on both a reported and adjusted basis, to 55.9% in 2014 compared to 56.5% in 2013 (or 55.6% and 56.2% on an adjusted basis in 2014 and 2013, respectively). included in cost of goods sold was $7.6 million of charges related to restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2014 and $8.8 million of restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2013.
research and development (r&d)
r&d expenses decreased approximately $6.2 million versus the prior year. overall, r&d expenses decreased 60 bps as a percentage of sales from 8.8% in 2013 to 8.2% in 2014. this decrease is primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense.
selling and administrative (s&a)
s&a, as a percentage of sales, decreased 40 bps to 16.7% versus 17.1%. excluding the $13.0 million spanish capital tax charge (as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements) in 2013, adjusted s&a expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.7% in 2013, consistent with the current year.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs.

fragrance ingredients rationalization in 2014, we closed our fragrance ingredients manufacturing facility in augusta, georgia and consolidated production into other company facilities. in connection with this closure in 2014, we incurred charges of $13.8 million, consisting primarily of $10.3 million in accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, $2.2 million in personnel-related costs and $1.3 million in plant shutdown and other related costs. we recorded total charges of $7.4 million during 2013, consisting of $2.2 million of pre-tax charges related to severance included in restructuring and other charges, net and $5.2 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold. during 2014, we recorded $1.3 million of plant shutdown and other related costs included in restructuring and other charges, net as well as an additional $5.1 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold. as a result of this closure, 43 positions were eliminated.
other during 2013, we reversed $1.2 million of employee-related liabilities, offset by $0.6 million of additional costs incurred related to the european rationalization plan announced in 2009. additionally, during 2013, we recorded a charge of $1.7 million related to the strategic initiative, which began in 2011.

flavors business unit flavors segment profit totaled $331.3 million in 2014 (22.7% of sales) consistent with $323.6 million (22.7% of sales) in the comparable 2013 period. the increase in segment profit was driven by lower incentive compensation expense.
fragrances business unit fragrances segment profit totaled $335.4 million in 2014 (20.6% of sales), compared to $283.7 million (18.5% of sales) reported in 2013. the improvement in segment profit and profit margin was primarily due to strong sales growth combined with gross margin expansion, ongoing cost discipline, and lower incentive compensation expense.
global expenses global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and r&d and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. in 2014, global expenses were $65.4 million compared to $66.9 million during 2013. the decrease is principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense.
interest expense in 2014, interest expense decreased $0.7 million to $46.1 million, as a result of the refinancing of our debt in 2013. average cost of debt was 4.9% for the 2014 period compared to 4.7% in 2013.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net decreased approximately $12.8 million to $2.8 million of income in 2014 versus $15.6 million of income in 2013. the decrease was largely driven by a $14.2 million gain related to the sale of non-operating assets that occurred during 2013.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 24.5% in 2014 as compared to 27.1% in 2013. excluding the $2.6 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs as well as the $3.8 million tax benefit related to the reserve reversal for the 2001 spanish dividend withholding tax case (as discussed in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements), the adjusted tax rate for 2014 was 25.3%. excluding the tax charge of $6.2 million related to the 2002-2003 income tax cases (as discussed in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements) and net of the $3.9 million tax benefit associated with the pretax spanish capital tax charge (as discussed in note 18 of the consolidated financial statements), the adjusted tax rate for 2013 was 25.7%. the year-over-year reduction reflects a benefit from mix of earnings and lower loss provisions partially offset by a higher cost of repatriation.

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents we had cash and cash equivalents of $182.0 million at december 31, 2015 compared to $478.6 million at december 31, 2014, of which $130.1 million of the balance at december 31, 2015 was held outside the united states. cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are, in most circumstances, available to be repatriated to the united states; however, they would be subject to united states federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. we have not provided u.s. income tax expense on substantially all of the accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we have the ability and plan to reinvest these indefinitely.
effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy. strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates u.s. taxable income, which enables us to realize u.s. deferred tax assets. we regularly repatriate, in the form of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries, a portion of our current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the u.s. these repatriations of current year earnings totaled $184.6 million, $248.0 million and $128.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
cash flows from operating activities operating cash flows in 2015 were $433.6 million compared to $518.4 million in 2014 and $407.6 million in 2013. the decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 is principally related to the impact of higher pension contributions, increased core working capital requirements and increased requirements related to various operating items (including taxes, employee benefits and prepaids). included in 2014 was payment of $11.2 million to the spanish government related to a capital tax case and included in 2013 was $48 million of cash payments related to the spanish tax cases.
working capital (current assets less current liabilities) totaled $713.8 million at year-end 2015 compared to $1,191.2 million at december 31, 2014. this decrease in working capital of $477.4 million primarily reflects a decrease in cash balances principally resulting from the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer during 2015 as well as higher payable balances. we sold certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under "factoring" agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers. we believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies. we estimate that, as a result of participating in the programs, there was a beneficial impact to cash inflows from operations of approximately $3.4 million, $33.1 million and $6.5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods.
cash flows used in investing activities net investing activities in 2015 utilized $577.2 million compared to $221.3 million and $105.4 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in cash paid for investing activities is primarily driven by the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer during 2015. we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ottens flavors and lucas meyer for approximately $188.5 million (net of cash acquired) and $304.9 million (net of cash acquired), respectively.
additions to property, plant and equipment were $101.0 million, $143.2 million and $134.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively (net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities). these investments largely arise from our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with our customer demand, primarily in emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy, but also reflect approximately $6.5 million in odor-abatement equipment which was invested to address environmental issues at one of our flavors facilities in china.
in light of our intent to construct a new flavors facility in china, our relocation of our ingredients facility in hangzhou, china and the continuation of our indonesia project we expect that capital spending in 2016 will be approximately 5% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities).
cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities net financing activities in 2015 had an outflow of $131.3 million compared to an outflow of $202.3 million and an outflow of $217.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 principally reflects higher incremental dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2015 which were more than offset by proceeds from the drawdown on the revolving credit facility during 2015. the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 principally reflects higher incremental dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2014 which were more than offset by the repayment of long-term debt of $100 million made in 2013.
42
at december 31, 2015, we had $1,070.2 million of debt outstanding compared to $942.3 million outstanding at december 31, 2014.
we paid dividends totaling $158.9 million, $133.2 million and $87.3 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the cash dividend declared per share in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $2.06, $1.72 and $1.46, respectively.
in december 2012, the board of directors authorized a $250 million share repurchase program, which commenced in the first quarter of 2013. in august 2015, the board of directors approved an additional $250 million share repurchase authorization and extension through december 31, 2017. based on the total remaining amount of $237 million available under the repurchase program, approximately 2.0 million shares, or 2.5% of shares outstanding (based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31, 2015) could be repurchased under the program as of december 31, 2015. the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant. repurchased shares will be placed into treasury stock. the ultimate level of purchases will be a function of the daily purchase limits established in the pre-approved program according to the share price at that time.
capital resources operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt repayments. we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months. we regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. based on our leverage ratios and general market interest rate expectations, we anticipate evaluating refinancing opportunities during 2016. we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements.
during the third quarter of 2015, we acquired lucas meyer for approximately $304.9 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
during the second quarter of 2015, we acquired ottens flavors for approximately $188.5 million (net of cash acquired), which was funded from existing resources.
credit facility and senior notes we supplement short-term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper. we did not issue commercial paper during 2015 and 2014.
credit facility there are two tranches under the credit facility. the tranche a facility is available in u.s. dollars, euros, swiss francs, japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of $456.0 million, with a sublimit of $25.0 million for swing line borrowings. the tranche b facility is available in euros, swiss francs, japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of $494.0 million. the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus a margin, currently 112.5 bps, linked to our credit rating. the interest rate under our credit facility at december 31, 2015 was 1.13%. the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12-month period of not more than 3.25 to 1. based on this ratio, at december 31, 2015 our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of $1,429.3 million.
as of december 31, 2015 we had $131.2 million borrowings under the credit facility. the amount which we are able to draw down on under the credit facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. our drawdown capacity on the credit facility was $790.7 million at december 31, 2015. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the credit facility.
at december 31, 2015 and 2014 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants, including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio. at december 31, 2015 our net debt/adjusted ebitda(1) ratio was 1.24 to 1 as defined by the credit facility, well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. if such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, and/or asset sales, if necessary. we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated.

senior notes senior notes - 2013. in april 2013, we issued $300.0 million face amount of 3.20% senior notes ("senior notes - 2013") due 2023 at a discount of $0.3 million, to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates and maintain efficiency and flexibility in our capital structure, and received proceeds of $297.8 million. the senior notes -2013 bear interest at a rate of 3.20% per year, with interest payable on may 1 and november 1 of each year, commencing on november 1, 2013. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes - 2013.
senior notes - 2007. in september 2007, we issued an aggregate of $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes in four series, with $250.0 million due in 2017, $100.0 million due in 2019, $50 million due in 2022 and $100.0 million due in 2027. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes - 2007.
senior notes - 2006. in 2006, we issued an aggregate of $375.0 million of senior unsecured notes in four series, of which $250.0 million has been repaid, and the remaining $125.0 million is due in 2016. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes - 2006.
other commitments compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive position. in 2015 and 2014, we spent $9.3 million and $4.3 million on capital projects and $19.0 million and $19.2 million, respectively, in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. in addition, we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act or similar state statutes. it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

the table above does not include $24.2 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $0.8 million of associated accrued interest. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. these estimates are based on management's best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. actual results may ultimately differ from estimates.
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve:
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill. we currently have goodwill of $941.4 million. in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in asc 350. the company has identified four reporting units: (1) flavors, (2) fragrance compounds (3) fragrance ingredients and (4) cosmetic active ingredients.
the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test, utilizing the two-step approach for the flavors, fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units, by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows. we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30, 2015, which indicated no impairment of goodwill, as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units. given the recent date of the acquisition of lucas meyer, we utilized the qualitative approach for the cosmetic active ingredients reporting unit, which indicated no impairment of goodwill.
the analysis and evaluation of income taxes. we account for taxes under the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than
45
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations.
the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for substantially all undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities. the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings approximates $233.6 million.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. we first determine whether it is "more likely than not" that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. for those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50% chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority. those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard. this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis, but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because, in certain cases, tax law is subject to varied interpretation, and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain. we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments, even if ultimately resolved against us, would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental-related matters. significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated.
we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters. to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable, we recognize a corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably estimated liability. to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable. management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery.
we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties ("prp's") associated with our exposure. recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp's to share such costs.
determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. in accordance with gaap, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods.
we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. we consider the historical long-term return experience of our assets, the current and expected allocation of our plan assets, and expected long-term rates of return. we derive these expected long-term rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors. we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative asset classes.
we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31. for the u.s. plans, the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody's aaa, aa and merrill lynch aaa-aa high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable u.s. plans are based on plan experience.
with respect to the u.s. plans, the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. the target asset
46
allocation consists of approximately: 40% in equity securities and 60% in fixed income securities. the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 6.9% over the previous 20 years. at december 31, 2015, the actual asset allocation was: 41% in equity securities; 58% in fixed income securities; and 1% in cash equivalents.
the expected rate of return for the non-u.s. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. the target asset allocation, for the non-u.s. plans, consists of approximately: 40% - 70% in fixed income securities; 15% - 40% in equity securities; 5% - 20% in real estate; and 5% - 10% in alternative investments. at december 31, 2015, the actual asset allocation was: 55% in fixed income investments; 27% in equity investments; 7% in real estate investments; 9% in alternative investments and 2% in cash and cash equivalents.
changes in pension and other post-employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. the impact that a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other post-employment benefit expense, as applicable, is as follows:

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. as of december 31, 2015, we maintained 48% of our inventory as raw materials. materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete.
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented. we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors.
new accounting standards in february 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to the accounting for leases. the new guidance establishes a new lease accounting model, that, for many companies, eliminates the concept of operating leases and requires entities to record assets and liabilities related to leases on the balance sheet for certain types of leases. the guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 31, 2018. early adoption will be permitted for all entities. the company is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
in november 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires entities to present all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption of this guidance is permitted. the company elected to adopt this guidance as of december 31, 2015 and accordingly has classified all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015. this guidance has been applied prospectively and prior amounts have not been adjusted retrospectively.
in september 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance relating to the adjustments made during the measurement period for items in a business combination. specifically, the new guidance would require adjustments related to the finalization of estimates to be recorded in the period when they are determined and to provide certain additional disclosures. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. the company has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

in july 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance relating to the measurement of inventory costs, which more closely aligns the measurement of inventory in generally accepted accounting principles with the measurement of inventory in international financial reporting standards. this guidance is effective for years beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance to clarify the principles to be used to recognize revenue and, in august 2015, issued authoritative guidance delaying the effective adoption date of that guidance by one year. the guidance is applicable to all entities and, based on the revised adoption date, is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017. adoption as of the original effective date is permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which provides a practical expedient related to the measurement date of defined benefit plan assets and obligations. this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the company adopted this guidance as of december 31, 2015 and it did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the company has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to accounting for the consolidation of certain legal entities. the guidance will change the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine the criteria for consolidating certain types of entities. this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the company has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap financial measures the company uses non-gaap financial operating measures in this annual report, including: (i) currency neutral sales (which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in u.s. dollars), (ii)  adjusted operating profit and operating profit margin (which excludes the acquisition related costs, reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case, operational improvement initiative and restructuring charges) and (iii) adjusted effective tax rate (which excludes the sale of a non-operating assets, tax and litigation settlements, restructuring charges, acquisition related costs, reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case and operational improvement initiative costs). the company also provides the non-gaap measures adjusted ebitda (which excludes certain specified items and non-cash items as set forth in the company's debt agreements) and net debt (which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents) solely for the purpose of providing information regarding the company's compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements.
we have included each of these non-gaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap. in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, on operating results and financial condition. we believe such additional non-gaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period-to-period performance of our business. in addition, management internally reviews each of these non-gaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to our business. a material limitation of these non-gaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts; for example, costs associated with operational improvements and restructuring activities involve actual cash outlays. we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics, including gaap measures. these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. if any of these risks occur, our business prospects, results of operations or financial condition could suffer, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock or debt securities.
risks related to our real estate investments and our operations developments such as another economic downturn, instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from current or future legislation or government initiatives may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
the industry in which we operate may be adversely affected by national and international economic conditions. although the u.s. real estate market has recently improved, certain international markets are experiencing increased levels of volatility due to a combination of factors, including, among others, political instability from ongoing geopolitical conflicts, high unemployment rates, fluctuating oil and gas prices and fiscal deficits, and these factors could contribute to another economic downturn in the u.s. if the u.s. experience another downturn in the economy, instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from changes in legislation, government tax increases, debt policy or spending restrictions, we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
other economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following:
•   local conditions, such as an oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent, or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area;
•   low mortgage interest rates and home pricing, making alternative housing more affordable;
•   government or builder incentives which enable home buyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive; and
•   regional economic downturns which affect one or more of our geographical markets.
failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders and unitholders.
our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements and/or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing. funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control. such events or conditions could include:
•   competition from other apartment communities;
•   overbuilding of new apartments or oversupply of available apartments in our markets, which might adversely affect occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in order to lease apartments;
•   conversion of condominiums and single family houses to rental use or the sale of excess for-sale condominiums and single family homes;
•   weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing;
•   increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rental rates;
•   inability to initially, or subsequently after lease terminations, rent apartments on favorable economic terms;
•   failure of development communities to be completed, if at all, within budget and on a timely basis or to lease up as anticipated;
•   changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance;
•   changes in laws including, but not limited to, tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing;
13
•   withdrawal of government support of apartment financing through its financial backing of the federal national mortgage association, or the federal home loan mortgage corporation;
•   an uninsured loss, including those resulting from a catastrophic storm, earthquake, or act of terrorism;
•   changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing, borrower credit standards, and down-payment requirements which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available) or increase our acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available); and
•   the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.
at times, we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program, including our existing property developments. while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate. any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities.
we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class, making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors.
as of december 31, 2015, substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector. as a result, we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property. a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had further diversified our investments.
our operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states; we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately 34.2% of our portfolio is located in our top five markets: atlanta, georgia; austin, texas; charlotte, north carolina; raleigh/durham, north carolina; and dallas, texas. in addition, our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states. our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in, and other factors relating to, these geographic areas, including supply and demand for apartments in these areas, zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing. in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment. to the extent the aforementioned general economic conditions, job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters, the value of the portfolio, our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt could be materially adversely affected.
failure to succeed in new markets or sectors may have adverse consequences on our performance.
we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets, should we choose to enter them. we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions, to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, to hire and retain key personnel, and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. in addition, we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may, as a result, fail to recover expenses already incurred.
substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our rental revenues and development and acquisition opportunities.
there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we have, within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities. the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on (1) our ability to rent our apartments and the rents charged, and (2) development and acquisition opportunities. the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
14
breaches of our privacy or information security systems through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or reputation.
we face risks associated with security breaches or disruptions, which could result from, among other incidents, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses or employee error or malfeasance. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. the protection of customer and employee data and our network systems is critically important to us. our business requires us and our service providers (including service providers engaged in providing web hosting, property management, leasing, accounting and/or payroll software/services) to use and store personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, which may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. we also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business.
we devote significant resources to protect our customer and employee data and our network systems. however, the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data security incident in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on our systems, that such access will not, whether temporarily or permanently, impact, interfere with or interrupt our operations, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner. our information technology infrastructure could be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts. even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. accordingly, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us and our service providers to entirely mitigate this risk. further, in the future, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
any privacy and information incident could compromise our network systems, and the information stored by us could be accessed, misused, publicly disclosed, corrupted, lost, or stolen resulting in fraud or other harm. moreover, if a data security incident or breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, we could be materially damaged and we may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation, possible liability and remediation costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or reputation and adversely affect investor confidence.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies.
we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;
•   even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition;
•   even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs;
•   we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete;
•   when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability;
•   we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability; and
•   we may acquire properties that are subject to liabilities or that have problems relating to environmental condition, state of title, physical condition or compliance with zoning laws, building codes or other legal requirements and in each case, our acquisition may be without any, or with only limited, recourse with respect to unknown liabilities or conditions and we may be obligated to pay substantial sums to settle or cure it, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results.
15
we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility.
we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities:
•   a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and
•   federal tax laws applicable to reits limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.
environmental problems are possible and can be costly.
under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in, on, around or under such property. such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. the presence of, or failure to remediate properly, hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral. persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person. certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks. in connection with the current or former ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management, development or control of real property, we may be considered an owner or operator of such communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines, and claims for injuries to persons and property.
our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each property we seek to acquire, which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling, and to proceed accordingly. we cannot assure you, however, that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future communities will reveal:
•   all or the full extent of potential environmental liabilities;
•   that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition unknown to us;
•   that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of such communities; or
•   that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period. a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability. thus, we may have liability with respect to communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us.
there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately. we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers mold-related claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold. to the extent not covered by our pollution policy, the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage, health concerns, or allegations thereof, arise.
16
losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage, which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce the value of our properties.
we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future. some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes or earthquakes, are subject to limitations, and thus may be uninsured. we exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. if we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment. inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties.
increasing real estate taxes, utilities and insurance costs may negatively impact operating results.
as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of real estate taxes, utilities, and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. real estate taxes, utilities costs and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which can be widely outside of our control. if the costs associated with real estate taxes, utilities and insurance should rise, without being offset by a corresponding increase in rental rates, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, and our ability to pay our dividends and distributions and senior debt could be affected.
compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost.
the americans with disabilities act, the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal, state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. these laws may require us to modify our existing communities. these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs. legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons. we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws, which may be substantial.
development and construction risks could impact our profitability.
as of december 31, 2015, we had five development communities under construction totaling 748 units. we had completed 37 units for these development projects as of december 31, 2015.  our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations;
•   yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than pro forma;
•   bankruptcy of developers in our development projects could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;
•   we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;
•   we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs;
•   occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and
•   when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defects that are uninsured or exceed the limit of our insurance.
17
we may be unable to retain key employees.
our success will depend in part upon the ability to retain our key employees. there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of our key personnel could have an adverse effect us.
risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2015, the amount of our total debt was approximately $3.43 billion. we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with, among other things, our acquisition, development and operating activities.
the degree of our leverage creates significant risks, including the following:
•   we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our funds from operations to servicing our debt and our cash flow may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest;
•   we may be subject to prepayment penalties if we elect to repay our indebtedness prior to the stated maturity date;
•   debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution to our shareholders and funds available for acquisitions, development and redevelopment;
•   we may be more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns than our competitors that have less debt;
•   we may be limited in our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions; and
•   we may default on our indebtedness, which could result in acceleration of those obligations, assignment of rents and leases and loss of properties to foreclosure.
if any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we may be unable to renew, repay or refinance our outstanding debt which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, the risk that indebtedness on our communities, or unsecured indebtedness, will not be able to be renewed, repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness. if we were unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our communities on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt. furthermore, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property, appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value. foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code.
rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt.
we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of our shares of common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us, which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.
we may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely impact our financial condition.
we currently fund the acquisition and development of multifamily apartment communities partially through borrowings (including our revolving credit facility) as well as from other sources such as sales of communities which no longer meet our investment criteria. our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur, and we may issue more debt in the future. accordingly, subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt and in an increased risk of default on our obligations.
18
the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments.
at december 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings of approximately $3.43 billion. our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios, maximum secured debt, maintenance of unencumbered asset value, and total debt to gross assets, among others. in the event that an event of default occurs, our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
a change in united states government policy with regard to fannie mae and freddie mac could impact our financial condition.
fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for multifamily real estate in the united states. we utilize loan programs sponsored by these entities as one source of capital to finance our growth and our operations. there has been ongoing discussion by the government with regard to the long term structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac, which could result in these agencies having their mandates changed or reduced, losing key personnel, being disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinuing to provide liquidity for the multifamily sector. we do not know when or if fannie mae or freddie mac will restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry or to us in particular. as of december 31, 2015, 7% of our outstanding debt was borrowed through a credit facility provided by or credit-enhanced by fannie mae with agency rate-based maturities ranging from 2016 through 2018. in 2015, we decreased the indebtedness outstanding on our fannie mae credit facilities from $436.9 million on december 31, 2014 to $240.0 million. a decision by the u.s. government to eliminate or downscale fannie mae or freddie mac or to reduce government support for multifamily housing more generally may adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and, as a result, may adversely affect us and our growth and operations.
failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations.
from time-to-time, we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. these agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding. we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings. in addition, a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition.
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities, development and capital expenditures, costs of operations and potential acquisitions. we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements. if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. accordingly, we could become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future. if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing, the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted.
19
risks related to maa's organization and ownership of its stock maa's ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock.
maa's charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 9.9% of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock, both common and preferred, unless approved by its board of directors. the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status. this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons, applying certain broad attribution rules of the code, owning 50% or more of its shares. if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, maa:
•   will consider the transfer to be null and void;
•   will not reflect the transaction on its books;
•   may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction;
•   will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares;
•   will not recognize any voting rights for those shares;
•   will consider the shares held in trust for its benefit; and
•   will either direct you to sell the shares and turn over any profit to maa, or maa will redeem the shares. if maa redeems the shares, you will be paid a price equal to the lesser of:
◦   the principal price paid for the shares by the holder,
◦   a price per share equal to the market price (as determined in the manner set forth in its charter) of the applicable capital stock,
◦   the market price (as so determined) on the date such holder would, but for the restrictions on transfers set forth in its charter, be deemed to have acquired ownership of the shares and
◦   the maximum price allowed under tennessee greenmail act (such price being the average of the highest and lowest closing market price for the shares during the 30 trading days preceding the purchase of such shares or, if the holder of such shares has commenced a tender offer or has announced an intention to seek control of maa, during the 30 trading days preceding the commencement of such tender offer or the making of such announcement).
the redemption price may be paid, at maa's option, by delivering one common unit (subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of, among other things, stock splits, stock dividends, or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers, consolidations or asset transfers by maa) issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed.
if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above:
•   you may lose your power to dispose of the shares;
•   you may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases; and
•   you may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases.
provisions of maa's charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa.
ownership limit the 9.9% ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors.
preferred stock maa's charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued. the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa, even if a change in control were in maa shareholders' best interests. as of december 31, 2015, no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
tennessee anti-takeover statutes as a tennessee corporation, maa is subject to various legislative acts, which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. these statutes
20
may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if maa's acquisition would be in maa shareholders' best interests.
market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa's common stock.
the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of maa's shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate. higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for maa to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase maa's borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. this could cause the market price of maa's common stock to go down. in addition, although maa's common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange, or nyse, the daily trading volume of maa's common stock may be lower than the trading volume for other industries. as a result, maa's investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maa's common stock.
changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maa's common stock.
we believe that the market value of a reit's equity securities is based primarily upon the market's perception of the reit's growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. for that reason, maa's common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of maa's common stock. in addition, we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maa's shareholders. our failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maa's stock.
the stock markets, including nyse, on which maa lists its common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of maa's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in maa's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maa's publicly traded securities are the following:
•   our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;
•   actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly and annual operating results;

risks related to the operating partnership's organization and ownership of op units the operating partnership's existing unitholders have limited approval rights, which may prevent the operating partnership's sole general partner, maa, from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders and of all the shareholders of maa.
maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership, dissolve the operating partnership or, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain, without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates, or class a op units. the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maa's ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all of our unitholders and all shareholders of maa.
in certain circumstances, certain of the operating partnership's unitholders must approve the operating partnership's sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders.
in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership, the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer. the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnership's unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all of the operating partnership's unitholders and all shareholders of maa.
maa, its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnership's affairs.
maa, as the operating partnership's sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors, has a substantial influence on the operating partnership's affairs. maa, its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the operating partnership's unitholders. also, maa owns approximately 94.8% of the op units and as such, will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnership's unitholders for approval.
market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa's common stock, which would affect the redemption price of the op units.
the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of maa's common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate. higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for maa to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase maa's borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. this could cause the market price of maa's common stock to go down, which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units, or if maa so elects, the value of maa's common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units. in addition, although maa's common stock is listed on the nyse, the daily trading volume of maa's shares may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries. as a result, maa's investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares.
insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maa's common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations.
the operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to service its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders, which may cause maa to not have the funds to pay distributions to its shareholders. maa's failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa's ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership, resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment or to service our debt or to make distributions to the operating partnership's unitholders.
22
risks related to tax laws failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders.
if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax). in addition, unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, it would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which maa loses its qualification. the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa's shareholders. furthermore, maa would no longer be required to make distributions to its shareholders. thus, maa's failure to qualify as a reit could also impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital, and would adversely affect the value of its common stock.
maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit, and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit. however, maa cannot assure you that it is qualified as a reit, or that maa will remain qualified in the future. this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa's control. in addition, future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification.
even if maa qualifies as a reit, maa will be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that maa does not distribute to its shareholders. in addition, maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries, or trss, and those trss will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable incomes without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits.
we may incur adverse tax consequences if colonial failed to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes; and if that occurs, it may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
prior to the merger, colonial operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes under the code. as discussed in exhibit 99.1 to our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on march 19, 2015, qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and colonial's qualification as a reit prior to the merger was generally subject to the same requirements, risks and uncertainties as described in such exhibit 99.1. moreover, the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that holds its assets through a partnership (such as we do and colonial did prior to the merger). the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within a reit's control may affect its ability to qualify as a reit.
if colonial is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to the merger, maa will face serious tax consequences and material tax liabilities. because maa owns no material assets other than its ownership interest in the operating partnership, the operating partnership and its subsidiaries would likely be required to provide cash to maa to satisfy any such tax liabilities, which would substantially reduce the operating partnership's available cash, including cash available to pay its indebtedness or make distributions to its limited partners or maa's shareholders because, among other things:
•   maa would be required to pay u.s. federal income tax on colonial's prior net income at regular corporate rates for the years colonial did not qualify for taxation as a reit (and, for such years, colonial would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to its former shareholders in computing its taxable income);
•   colonial could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes for such periods; and
•   unless colonial is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, neither it nor any "successor" company could elect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified.
maa is liable for any taxes payable by colonial for any periods prior to the merger. in addition, if colonial failed to qualify as a reit but we nonetheless qualified as a reit, in the event of a taxable disposition of a former colonial asset during
23
the five years following the merger we would be subject to corporate tax with respect to any built-in gain inherent in such asset as of the date of the merger. in addition, under the "investment company" rules under section 368 of the code, if both maa and colonial were "investment companies" under such rules, the failure of either colonial or us to have qualified as a reit could cause the merger to be taxable to us and our shareholders. as a result of all these factors, colonial's failure to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize our qualification as a reit and require our operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to us to satisfy our additional tax liabilities and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or distributions to our shareholders.
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
we believe that the operating partnership qualifies, and has so qualified since its formation, as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. no assurance can be provided, however, that the internal revenue service, or irs, will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates. in addition, the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit. see "failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders" above.
recent tax legislation impacts certain u.s. federal income tax rules applicable to reits and could adversely affect our current tax positions.
the recently enacted protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 (the "path act") contains changes to certain aspects of the u.s. federal income tax rules applicable to us. the path act is the most recent example of changes to the reit rules, and additional legislative changes may occur that could adversely affect our current tax positions. the path act modifies various rules that apply to our ownership of, and business relationship with, our trss and reduces the maximum allowable value of our assets attributable to trss from 25% to 20% which could impact our ability to enter into future investments. the path act makes permanent the reduction of the recognition period (from ten years to five years) during which an entity that converted from a corporation to a reit or was acquired by a reit is subject to a corporate-level tax on built-in gains recognized during such period, which could influence the types of investments we enter into in the future. the path act also makes multiple changes related to the foreign investment in real property tax act, expands prohibited transaction safe harbors and qualifying hedges, and repeals the preferential dividend rule for public reits previously applicable to us. lastly, the path act adjusts the way we may calculate certain earnings and profits calculations to avoid double taxation at the stockholder level, and expands the types of qualifying assets and income for purposes of the reit requirements. the provisions enacted by the path act could result in changes in our tax positions or investments, and future legislative changes related to those rules described above could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership, of which maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 94.8% limited partner interest as of december 31, 2015. maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and the operating partnership's various subsidiaries. this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty. the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical.
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 805-10, business combinations, which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts. in calculating the fair value of acquired tangible assets, management divides forecasted net operating income (noi) by a market capitalization rate. management analyzed historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets. although management's estimates of the fair value of acquired tangible assets have been materially accurate in the past, variability of future operating performance as well as additional information becoming available could lead to the modification of the initial fair value calculation and purchase price allocation. subsequent adjustments made to the purchase price allocation, if any, would be made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year.
impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill we account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. we periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. if impairment indicators exist for a long-lived asset, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. management estimates future cash flows by analyzing historical cash flows generated by the asset. if impairment indicators exist for goodwill, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the implied fair value of the asset. management calculates the fair value of the asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. historically, impairment analysis estimates have been materially accurate, which resulted in no impairment losses recognized during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.
41
cost capitalization repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. the carrying costs related to development projects, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period, are capitalized. management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized.
loss contingencies the outcomes of claims, disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty. we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. we review these accruals quarterly and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the we do not accrue the loss. however, for material loss contingencies, if the unrecorded loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then we disclose a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then that is disclosed.
the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involve a series of complex judgments about future events. among the factors that we consider in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10-k, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar matters, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the proceeding or claim. our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. in such instances, we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any.

overview of the year ended december 31, 2015
we experienced an increase in income from continuing operations in 2015 as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses. the increases in revenues came from a 6.3% increase in our large market same store segment, a 4.7% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 1.0% increase in our non-same store and other segment. the increase in expense came from a 3.6% increase in our large market same store segment and a 3.2% increase in our secondary market same store segment, which were offset slightly by an 8.0% decrease in our non-same store and other segment. our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least twelve months. communities excluded from the same store portfolio include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified for disposition. additional information regarding the composition of operating segments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 16 - segment information. the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section.
on october 1, 2013, we consummated the merger and acquired all of colonial's net assets. as a result of the merger, the results of operations for 2013 include three months of results for the legacy colonial portfolio. the results of operations for 2014 and 2015 include twelve months of results for the legacy colonial portfolio.
we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the southeast and southwest region of the united states. apart from the merger, we acquired four apartment communities for our portfolio in 2013, eight in 2014 and seven in 2015. offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were nine apartment community dispositions in 2013, eight in 2014, and 21 in 2015.

the following table shows our apartment real estate assets as of december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:
2015                                                                                                   2014                2013

average effective monthly rent/unit, excluding lease-up and development      $1,006                $948                $883
occupancy, excluding lease-up and development                                  95.6   %            94.1   %            94.9   %
average effective monthly rent per unit is calculated as the average of monthly gross rent amounts for occupied units, after the effect of leasing concessions, plus then-prevailing market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. we believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing; however, it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. for additional discussion of same store average rent per unit and occupancy comparisons, see the "trends" section below.
in addition to the multifamily assets detailed above, we also owned an interest in two commercial properties totaling approximately 238,000 square feet of leasable space.

the increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased average rental revenue per occupied unit of 5.5% and 3.8% for our large and secondary markets, respectively, and an increased average physical occupancy of 0.8% and 0.9% for our large and secondary markets, respectively.

the increase in property operating expenses from our large market same store group is primarily the result of increases in real estate taxes of $3.2 million, personnel expenses of $1.9 million, water expenses of approximately $1.0 million, cable expenses of $0.5 million, and waste removal expenses of $0.2 million. the increase in property operating expenses from our secondary market same store group is primarily a result of increases in other operating expenses of $1.5 million, real estate taxes of $1.1 million, and personnel expenses of $1.2 million. the decrease in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other group is primarily the result of decreases in personnel expenses of $2.4 million and utility expenses of $1.7 million.

the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to a decrease of $19.4 million related to the amortization of the fair value of in-place leases and resident relationships acquired as a result of the merger from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of $11.7 million driven by an increase in gross real estate assets from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015.
property management expenses property management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 were approximately $31.0 million, a decrease of $1.1 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. the majority of the decrease was related to a decrease in state franchise taxes of $2.1 million, partially offset by an increase in insurance expense of $0.6 million, an increase in payroll expense of $0.3 million, and an increase in incentive expense $0.3 million.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 were approximately $25.7 million, an increase of $4.8 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. the majority of the increase was related to increases in legal fees of $2.7 million and stock option expenses of $1.6 million.

merger and integration related expenses there were no merger or integration related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, as these expenses related primarily to severance, legal, professional, temporary systems, staffing, and facilities costs incurred for the acquisition and integration of colonial. for the year ended december 31, 2014, merger and integration related expenses were approximately $3.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively.
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 was approximately $122.3 million, a decrease of $1.6 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in amortization of deferred financing cost from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 of approximately $0.9 million. also, the overall debt balance decreased from $3.5 billion to $3.4 billion, a decrease of $85.1 million. the average effective interest rate remained at 3.7% and the average years to rate maturity increased from 4.4 years to 4.8 years.
dispositions of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of $190.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $147.3 million from the $42.6 million gain on sale of depreciable assets recorded for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily the result of increased disposition activity. dispositions increased from eight multifamily properties for the year ended december 31, 2014, to 21 multifamily properties for the year ended december 31, 2015.
gain from real estate joint ventures we recorded a gain from real estate joint ventures of $6.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 as opposed to no material gain or loss being recorded during the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease was primarily a result of recording a $3.4 million gain for the disposition of ansley village by mid-america multifamily fund ii, or fund ii, as well as a $2.8 million gain for the promote fee received from our fund ii partner during 2014. the promote fee was received as a result of maa achieving certain performance metrics in its management of the fund ii properties over the life of the joint venture. there were no such gains recorded during the year ended december 31, 2015.
discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $5.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. we did not record a gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations during the year ended december 31, 2015, due to the adoption of asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity, which resulted in dispositions being included in the gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations and is discussed further below.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2015 was approximately $18.5 million, an increase of $10.2 million from the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase is consistent with the increase to overall net income and is primarily a result of the items discussed above.
net income attributable to maa primarily as a result of the items discussed above, net income attributable to maa increased by approximately $184.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 from the year ended december 31, 2014.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2013
the comparison of the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2013 shows the segment break down based on the 2014 same store portfolios. a comparison using the 2015 same store portfolio would not be comparative due to the nature of the classifications as a result of the merger.

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our same store portfolio resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger.
property management expenses property management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 were approximately $32.1 million, an increase of $9.0 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the majority of the increase was related to increases in payroll expenses of $3.0 million, state franchise taxes of $2.7 million, software maintenance of $2.1 million, and incentive bonuses of $0.9 million as a result of the increased headcount and scope of work resulting from the merger.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $20.9 million, an increase of $5.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the majority of the increase was related to increases in incentive bonuses of $3.3 million and payroll expenses of $1.2 million as a result of the merger.
merger and integration related expenses merger related expenses, primarily severance, legal, and professional costs for the acquisition of colonial were approximately $3.2 million from the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $29.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. we also incurred integration related expenses, primarily related to temporary systems, staffing, and facilities costs of $8.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $3.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013.
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $124.0 million, an increase of $45.0 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding from the year ended december 31, 2013 to the year ended december 31, 2014 of approximately $1.38 billion, due primarily to the assumption of colonial's debt as a result of the merger.
debt extinguishment loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $2.6 million, an increase of -$2.2 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily the result of the prepayment of a loan for a property sold during the year ended december 31, 2014.
discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $5.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to a $76.8 million gain for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease in the gain is caused by the proceeds received in 2014 being less than the proceeds received in 2013 in relation to the net book value of the properties sold and, in accordance with newly adopted asu 2014-08, recording a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations in 2014, which is discussed further below.
dispositions of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of $42.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. we did not record a similar gain for the year ended december 31, 2013 because we did not dispose of any properties that were excluded from discontinued operations.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $8.3 million, an increase of $4.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013.

net income attributable to maa primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to maa increased by approximately $32.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 from the year ended december 31, 2013.
funds from operations funds from operations, or ffo, a non-gaap financial measure, represents net income (computed in accordance with gaap) excluding extraordinary items, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis. disposition of real estate assets includes, but is not limited to, sales of discontinued operations.
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income, or any other gaap measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.
core ffo, a non-gaap financial measure, represents ffo excluding certain non-cash or non-routine items such as acquisition, merger and integration expenses, mark-to-market debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment. while our definition of core ffo is similar to others in our industry, our precise methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits. core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. management believes that core ffo is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.

physical occupancy ended 2015 at 96.5% and average physical occupancy for the same store portfolio was 96.1% for the year. same store effective rent per unit continued to grow, up 4.4% in the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2014. this compares to 3.3% growth achieved in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2013.
an important part of our portfolio strategy is maintaining a broad diversity of markets across the southeast and southwest regions of the united states. the diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. we believe that a well-diversified portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets, will perform well in "up" cycles as well as weather "down" cycles better. as of december 31, 2015, we were invested in approximately 40 defined metropolitan statistical areas, with approximately 65% of our multifamily assets, based on gross assets, in large markets and 35% of our multifamily assets in select secondary markets.
new supply of rental units has increased in several of our key markets and multifamily permitting increased in 2015 as compared to 2014. we believe this permitting will ultimately lead to a further increase in supply but also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years combined with demand from new households will help keep supply and demand in balance in most markets. also, we believe that more disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to favor rental demand at existing multi-family properties. furthermore, rental competition from single family homes has not been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio. in 2015, move outs attributable to single family rentals remained relatively consistent with prior years. we have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets. long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest) will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets.
our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system. as noted above, physical occupancy ended 2015 strong and also averaged 75 basis points higher in 2015 as compared to 2014. as we continue through the typically slower winter leasing season, the current level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to maximize pricing in the first quarter of 2016.
we continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues. the continued benefit of ancillary services (such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs), improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue. we also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses, such as new web-sites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively.
liquidity and capital resources our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources. the significant changes in cash from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 due to operating, investing, and financing activities are as follows:
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to $463.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from $385.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this change was a result of various items, including higher revenues, as discussed above.

the increase in cash outflows from purchases of real estate and other assets primarily resulted from the acquisition of seven apartment communities and three land acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the acquisition of eight apartment communities and no land acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2014. additionally, the apartment communities acquired during the year ended december 31, 2014 included debt assumptions, which reduced the amount of cash paid for these properties. the increase in proceeds from disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of 21 apartment communities, one commercial property, and one land parcel during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the sale of eight apartment communities, two commercial properties, and six land parcels during the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease in distributions from real estate joint ventures primarily resulted from the receipt of funds from the sale of two joint venture properties during the year ended december 31, 2014. no joint venture properties were sold during 2015. the decrease in cash inflows from the funding of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the funding of two 1031(b) transactions during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the funding of three 1031(b) transactions and the return of escrow related to two 1031(b) transactions during the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease in cash outflows for development resulted from the timing of development spending for two projects commencing during the year ended december 31, 2015.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased to $316.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from $244.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the primary drivers of this change are as follows:

the increase in cash outflows from the net change in credit lines from 2014 to 2015 was due to the timing of borrowings and repayments on our various lines of credit. the increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable is primarily due to the fact that during 2015 we paid off the principal balance due on unsecured public bond notes payable originally issued by colonial that matured during the year. the decrease in cash inflows from the exercise of stock options resulted from the exercise of approximately 7,000 stock options during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the exercise of approximately 270,000 stock options during the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in cash outflows
51
from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to $0.77 per share during the year ended december 31, 2015 from $0.73 per share during the year ended december 31, 2014.
equity as of december 31, 2015, maa owned 75,408,571 op units, comprising a 94.8% limited partnership interest in the operating partnership, while the remaining 4,162,996 outstanding op units were held by limited partners of the operating partnership. holders of op units (other than maa and its corporate affiliates) may require us to redeem their op units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per op unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of maa's common stock on the new york stock exchange over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of our common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each op unit so redeemed. in addition, we have registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended, the 4,162,996 shares of our common stock, which as of december 31, 2015, were issuable upon redemption of op units held by the operating partnership's limited partners so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets. to the extent that additional op units are issued to limited partners of the operating partnership, we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those op units under the securities act of 1933, as amended, so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets. if maa issues shares of common stock upon the redemption of op units in the operating partnership, sales of substantial amounts of such shares of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for maa common stock or may impair maa's ability to raise capital through the sale of common stock or other equity securities.
in connection with the merger, we issued approximately 31.9 million shares of maa common stock and approximately 2.6 million op units on october 1, 2013.

unsecured credit facility on october 15, 2015, our operating partnership entered into a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with keybank national association and fourteen other banks. this credit facility replaced our operating partnership's previous unsecured credit facility with keybank. interest rate is determined using an investment grade pricing grid using libor plus a spread of 0.85% to 1.55%. as of december 31, 2015, we had $75.0 million borrowed under this
53
facility. this facility serves as our primary source of short-term liquidity and has an accordion feature that we may use to expand its capacity to $1.5 billion.
unsecured term loans in addition to our unsecured credit facility, we maintain three unsecured term loans. we had total borrowings of $550.0 million outstanding under these term loan agreements at december 31, 2015.
the $250.0 million wells fargo term loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. the loan matures on august 1, 2018. as of december 31, 2015, this loan was bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 1.15%.
the $150.0 million u.s. bank term loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. the loan matures on march 1, 2020. as of december 31, 2015, this loan was bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 1.15%.
the $150.0 million term loan agreement with key bank bears interest at a rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.75% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. the loan matures on march 1, 2021. as of december 31, 2015, this loan was bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 1.10%.
senior unsecured notes we have also issued public and private unsecured notes.  as of december 31, 2015, we have approximately $1.2 billion of publicly issued bonds and $310 million of private placement notes.  in october 2013 we issued $350.0 million senior notes due 2023 with a coupon of 4.30%, paid semi-annually on april 15 and october 15.   in june 2014 we issued $400.0 million senior notes due 2024 with a coupon of 3.75%, paid semi-annually on june 15 and december 15.  in november 2015 we issued $400.0 million senior notes due 2025 with a coupon of 4.00%, paid semi-annually on may 15 and november 15.  we also assumed approximately $75.3 million in senior notes as part of the colonial merger.  as of december 31, 2015 all of these amounts remained outstanding.
on july 29, 2011, we issued $135.0 million of senior unsecured notes. the notes were offered in a private placement with three maturity tranches: $50.0 million at 4.7% maturing on july 29, 2018, $72.8 million at 5.4% maturing on july 29, 2021; and $12.3 million at 5.6% maturing on july 29, 2023; all of which is outstanding at december 31, 2015.

secured credit facilities we rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to refinance debt maturities, and on rate renewals for fannie mae. fannie mae provided credit enhancement for approximately $240.0 million of our outstanding debt through our fannie mae facilities, as defined below, as of december 31, 2015.
the interest rate markets for fannie mae discount mortgage backed securities, or dmbs, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month libor interest rates, are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. prudential mortgage capital, a delegated underwriting and servicing, or dus, lender for fannie mae, markets 90-day fannie mae dmbs monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us at dmbs rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between prudential and us.
approximately 7.0% of our outstanding obligations at december 31, 2015 were borrowed through a credit facility credit enhanced by fannie mae, which we also refer to as the fannie mae facility. the fannie mae facility has line limit of $240.0 million, of which $240.0 million was collateralized, available to borrow, and borrowed, at december 31, 2015. various fannie mae rate tranches of the fannie mae facility mature from 2016 through 2018. the fannie mae facility provides for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the fannie mae dmbs rate which are credit-enhanced by fannie mae and are typically sold every 90 days by prudential mortgage capital at interest rates approximating three-month london interbank offered rate, or libor, less a spread that has averaged 0.17%
54
over the life of the fannie mae facility, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.62%. we have seen more volatility in the spread between the dmbs and three-month libor since late 2007 than was historically prevalent.
secured property mortgages we also maintain secured property mortgages with fannie mae, freddie mac, and various life insurance companies. these mortgages are usually fixed rate and can range from 5 to 10 years in maturity. as of december 31, 2015, we have $1.0 billion of secured property mortgages.

off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2015, and 2014, we did not have any relationships, including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
in addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. as such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements, note 14.
as of december 31, 2015, we had a 25.0% ownership interest in the mckinney joint venture, which consists of undeveloped land.
as of december 31, 2015, we had a 33.3% ownership interest in the land title building joint venture, which consists of 29,971 square feet of commercial space.
our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method for the joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest.
insurance we renegotiated our primary insurance programs effective july 1, 2015. we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that
55
any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation.
inflation our resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable us to seek rent increases. almost all leases are for one year or less. the short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation.

impact of recently issued accounting standards the following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material effect on our financial statements:
standard                                                                                                 description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           date of adoption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       effect on the financial statements or other significant matters accounting standards update (asu) 2015-03 and asu 2015-15, interest -imputation of interest              asu 2015-03, requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. asu 2015-15 provides additional guidance to asu 2015-03, which did not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. asu 2015-15 noted that the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.   this asu is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2015; however, early adoption is permitted.                                                                                                                                                                         we adopted this asu on december 31, 2015. the adoption of this asu resulted in the reclassification of $13.3 million and $11.8 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the company's secured property mortgages, senior unsecured notes, and unsecured term loans from deferred financing costs, net to a reduction in unsecured and secured notes payable within its consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
asu 2014-15, disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern        this asu requires an entity's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. if substantial doubt exists, the entity must disclose the principal conditions or events that raised the substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of these conditions, and management's plan for alleviating the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.                                                                                                                         this asu is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted.                                                                                                                                                                         we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this asu, but do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole.
asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers                                                       this asu establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, as a result of a deferral of the effective date arising from the issuance of asu 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers - deferral of the effective date. early adoption is permitted.   the amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this asu on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations taken as a whole and plan on completing this assessment in the fourth quarter of 2016, but we do not expect the impact to be material. we have not yet determined which method will be used for initial application.
asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity   this asu raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations. it also requires additional disclosures for discontinued operations and new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years; however, early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2014.                                                                                         we adopted this asu on january 1, 2014. the adoption of this asu required us to not classify certain disposals occurring during 2014 as discontinued operations. the 2014 dispositions did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment and therefore the gains on these properties are presented as a component of continuing operations for 2014.

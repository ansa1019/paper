item 1a.  risk factors the company's business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the company's operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired.
security problems could damage our reputation and business. we rely on industry-standard encryption, network and internet security systems, most of which we license from third parties, to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet. computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks and other forms of cyber-terrorism. individual personal computers can be stolen, and customer data media can be lost in shipment. under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches, the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial. advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate. security risks may result in liability to our customers, damage to our reputation, and may deter
12
financial institutions from purchasing our products. we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches, and, in the event of a breach, we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by such breach. addressing security problems may result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service to users, any of which could harm our business.
operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims, increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers. damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers, expose us to damage claims, and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment. our back-up systems and procedures may not prevent disruption, such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services. in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours, we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption. any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue, have a negative impact on our reputation, result in damage claims, lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers, and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions, with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs.
failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss. the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is very large and continues to grow. we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. transactions facilitated by us include debit card, credit card, electronic bill payment transactions, automated clearing house ("ach") payments and check clearing that supports consumers, financial institutions and other businesses. if the continuity of operations, integrity of processing, or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions, this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us. in addition, we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products. if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. in addition, we may issue credit to consumers, financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement. a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us.
we recently restated our prior consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price. in june 2015 we restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended september 30, 2014, for the years ended june 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and for the quarterly periods within the fiscal years ended june 30, 2014 and 2013 (the "restated periods"). the determination to restate the financial statements for the restated periods was made by our audit committee upon management's recommendation following the identification of errors related to our method of accounting for revenue from certain bundled software multi-element agreements. due to the errors, our management concluded that the company's previously issued financial statements for the restated periods should no longer be relied upon.
as a result of these events, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the risk of potential stockholder litigation. if lawsuits are filed, we may incur additional substantial defense costs regardless of the outcome of such litigation. likewise, such events might cause a diversion of our management's time and attention. if we do not prevail in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs. in addition, the restatement may lead to a loss of investor confidence and have negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock.
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements. our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. in connection with the restated consolidated financial statements filed in june 2015, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting based upon our identification of certain errors related to our method of accounting for revenue from certain bundled software multi-element agreements. a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. as a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30, 2014. our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended june 30, 2014 and quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2014 were amended to, among other things, reflect the change in management's conclusion regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. the previously identified material weakness remains
13
unremediated as of june 30, 2015 and as a result our management has concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30, 2015.
we are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect the company's business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the company to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm its reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.
our business may be adversely impacted by u.s. and global market and economic conditions. we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry. if the economic environment worsens, we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees, which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending. deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and the company's related revenues.
changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products. cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions. unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions, including spending on computer software and hardware. such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgrade/complementary product sales to existing customers. the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure.
competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income. we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines. we compete on the basis of product quality, reliability, performance, ease of use, quality of support and services, integration with other products and pricing. some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size, product lines, greater marketing resources, or exclusive intellectual property rights. if competitors offer more favorable pricing, payment or other contractual terms, warranties, or functionality, or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services, we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete.
the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business. we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees. our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals. if we lose one or more of our key employees, we could suffer a loss of sales and delays in new product development, and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers.
the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business, increase costs, or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations. the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. as a supplier of services to financial institutions, portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency, the federal reserve board, the federal deposit insurance corporation, and the national credit union association, among other regulatory agencies. these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate, and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations.
in december 2013 we entered into an agreement with the comptroller of the currency, the federal deposit insurance corporation, and the federal reserve bank of st. louis, which together regulate the company's operations as the federal financial institutions examination council ("ffiec").  in 2012, operations at the company's lyndhurst, nj processing center were temporarily but significantly disrupted by super storm sandy, impacting the financial institutions served by that facility until the company was able to return to normal operations. the agreement commits the company to a process of assessing, improving and monitoring its disaster recovery and business continuity plans and the management of related risks across the company.  the agreement also commits the company to a process of reporting on corrective actions and to monitoring of its compliance with applicable regulations and guidance from the regulators and the ffiec. regular reports of progress have been made to clients and to the regulators.  the company has met all of the deadlines stipulated in the agreement and continues to mature the identified processes with the objective of achieving full compliance. failure to comply with the agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business.
14
in addition, existing laws, regulations, and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion. the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, signed into law in 2010, significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry, producing new regulatory agencies and voluminous new regulations, many of which are still being written. these new regulations may require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel. our customers are also regulated entities, and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions. concerns are growing with respect to the use, confidentiality, and security of private customer information. regulatory agencies, congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined.
the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation. we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations. in particular, numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010. substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving, complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment. our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers, for which we may bear ultimate liability.
our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations. while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions, as a provider of processing services to such institutions, we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities. if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation. such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers.
if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve, we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business. the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes. these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services. our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services. if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned, or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services, we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues.
our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions. we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses, products and services. this strategy depends on our ability to identify, negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions. substantial recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions. if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth.
if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes. we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others. infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services. such claims, whether with or without merit, are time-consuming, may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us. if our defense of such claims is not successful, we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications.
consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. our primary market consists of approximately 6,500 commercial and savings banks and 6,500 credit unions. the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures over the last few years and mergers and acquisitions over the last several decades and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs.
acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate. we have acquired a number of businesses in the last decade and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future. we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies. we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including: financial control and computer system compatibility; unanticipated costs; unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services; differing regulatory  and industry standards; diversion of management's attention; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; loss of key employees; and significant amortization expenses related to
15
acquired assets. to finance future acquisitions, we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public. if we fail to integrate our acquisitions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets.
we may not be able to manage growth. we have grown both internally and through acquisitions. our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative, operational, financial and management personnel and systems. we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines, manage costs, adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth.
expansion of services to non-traditional customers could expose us to new risks. some of our recent acquisitions include business lines that are marketed outside our traditional, regulated, and litigation-averse base of financial institution customers. these non-regulated customers may entail greater operational, credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs.
failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business. our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five or more years. because of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last five years, we will experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal over the next few years. renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us. if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms, our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following section provides management's view of the financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data, the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
overview jack henry & associates, inc. (jha) is headquartered in monett, missouri, employs approximately 5,900 associates nationwide, and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations. its solutions serve nearly 10,900 customers and are marketed and supported through three primary brands. jack henry banking® supports banks ranging from community to multi-billion dollar institutions with information and transaction processing solutions. symitar® is a leading provider of information and transaction processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes. profitstars® provides highly specialized products and services that enable financial institutions of every asset size and charter, and diverse corporate entities outside the financial services industry, to mitigate and control risks, optimize revenue and growth opportunities, and contain costs. jha's integrated solutions are available for in-house installation and outsourced and hosted delivery.
each of our brands share the fundamental commitment to provide high quality business solutions, service levels that consistently exceed customer expectations, integration of solutions and practical new technologies. the quality of our solutions, our high service standards, and the fundamental way we do business typically foster long-term customer relationships, attract prospective customers, and have enabled us to capture substantial market share.
through internal product development, disciplined acquisitions, and alliances with companies offering niche solutions that complement our proprietary solutions, we regularly introduce new products and services and generate new cross-sales opportunities across our three business brands. we provide compatible computer hardware for our in-house installations and secure processing environments for our outsourced and hosted solutions. we perform data conversions, software implementations, initial and ongoing customer training, and ongoing customer support services.
our primary competitive advantage is customer service. our support infrastructure and strict standards provide service levels we believe to be the highest in the markets we serve and generate high levels of customer satisfaction and retention. we consistently measure customer satisfaction using comprehensive annual surveys and randomly generated daily surveys we receive in our everyday business. dedicated surveys are also used to grade specific aspects of our customer experience, including product implementation, education, and consulting services.
a significant proportion of our revenue is derived from recurring outsourcing fees and transaction processing fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or greater at inception. support and service fees also include in-house maintenance fees on primarily annual contract terms. less predictable software license fees and hardware
19
sales complement our primary revenue sources. we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins.
during the last five fiscal years, our revenues have grown from $946,394 in fiscal 2011 to $1,256,190 in fiscal 2015. income from continuing operations has grown from $128,394 in fiscal 2011 to $211,221 in fiscal 2015. this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion.
we have two reportable segments: bank systems and services and credit union systems and services. the respective segments include all related license, support and service, and hardware sales along with the related cost of sales.
we continue to focus on our objective of providing the best integrated solutions, products and customer service to our clients. we are cautiously optimistic regarding ongoing economic improvement and expect our clients to continue investing in our products and services to improve their operating efficiencies and performance. we anticipate that consolidation within the financial services industry will continue. regulatory conditions and legislation such as the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act will continue to impact the financial services industry and could motivate some financial institutions to postpone discretionary spending.
a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows. all dollar amounts are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2014 and compare fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013.
results of operations fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
in fiscal 2015, revenues increased 7% or $83,017 compared to the prior year due primarily to growth in all components of support and service revenues, particularly our electronic payment services and our outsourcing services. cost of sales increased 6%, in line with revenue. the growth in revenue and the company's continued focus on cost management continued to drive up gross margins, which has resulted in a 9% increase in gross profit.
operating expenses increased 6% and the provision for income taxes increased 4% compared to the prior year-to-date period. the increased revenue and above changes resulted in a combined 13% increase in net income for fiscal 2015.
we move into fiscal 2016 following strong performance in fiscal 2015. significant portions of our business continue to come from recurring revenue and our healthy sales pipeline is also encouraging. our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address, and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency. our strong balance sheet, access to extensive lines of credit, the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities.

license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer, which are not part of a bundled arrangement. we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution.
non-bundled license revenue increased due mainly to an increase in standalone license sales in our credit union segment. such license fees will fluctuate as non-bundled license sales are sporadic in nature.

support and service revenues are generated from annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software, electronic payment services, outsourced data processing services, implementation services (including conversion, installation, configuration and training) and revenue from our bundled software multi-element agreements. there was growth in all components of support and service revenue in fiscal 2015.
in-house support and other services revenue increased due to annual maintenance renewal fee increases for both core and complementary products as our customers' assets grow.
electronic payment services continue to experience the largest dollar growth. the revenue increases are attributable to strong performance across debit/credit card transaction processing services, online bill payment services and ach processing.
outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions. we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future. revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multi-year service contracts and therefore provide a long-term stream of recurring revenues.
implementation services include implementation services for our outsourcing and electronic payment services customers as well as standalone customization services, merger conversion services, image conversion services and network monitoring services. implementation services revenue increased due mainly to increased implementations across our core, online banking, imaging solutions and payments products.
bundled products and services revenue is combined revenue from the multiple elements in our bundled arrangements, including license, implementation services and maintenance, which cannot be recognized separately due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value. bundled products and services revenue increased slightly from last year mainly due to increased revenues from our core and complementary banking products, furthered by an increase in core credit union products. the increase was partially offset by reduced revenues from our alogent® suite of remote deposit capture products.

percentage of total revenue           4    %                5    %
the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers and suppliers under which we sell computer hardware, hardware maintenance and related services to our customers. revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers.
hardware revenue decreased due to a decrease in complementary hardware products delivered. although there will be quarterly fluctuations, we expect an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales to continue due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts, which typically do not include hardware, and the general deflationary trend of computer prices.
21
cost of sales and gross profit cost of license represented the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements associated with non-bundled application software licenses. these costs were recognized when license revenue was recognized. cost of support and service represented costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts, ongoing support for our in-house customers, operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers, electronic payment services and direct operating costs. these costs were recognized as they were incurred or, for direct costs associated with obtaining and implementing our bundled arrangements, they are deferred and recognized ratably as the related revenues for these arrangements are recognized, typically beginning when pcs is the only remaining undelivered element, and ending at the end of the initial bundled pcs term. cost of hardware consisted of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers. these costs were recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue was recognized. ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers were recognized as they were incurred.

cost of license consists of the direct costs of third party software that are a part of a non-bundled arrangement. sales of these third party software products increased compared to last year, causing a decrease in gross profit margins. shifts in sales mix between the products that make up these costs cause fluctuations in the margins from period to period.
gross profit margins in support and service remained consistent with the prior year.
in general, changes in cost of hardware trend consistently with hardware revenue. for the fiscal year, margins were slightly higher due to increased sales of higher margin hardware upgrade products.

we devote significant effort and expense to develop new software, service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings. typically, we upgrade our various core and complementary software applications once per year. we believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customer-driven.
research and development expenses increased primarily due to increased headcount and related personnel costs, but were consistent with the prior year as a percentage of total revenue.

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
in fiscal 2014, revenues increased 6% or $65,649 compared to the prior year due primarily to strong growth in all components of support and service revenues, particularly our electronic payment services and our outsourcing services. the growth in revenue and the company's continued focus on cost management continued to drive up gross margins, which resulted in a 7% increase in gross profit.
operating expenses decreased 2% for the year mainly due to $12,436 of expenses in the prior year related to the impact of hurricane sandy flooding on our lyndhurst, new jersey item processing center. provision for income taxes increased over the prior year. the prior year provision for income tax was low due to the tax impact of the lyndhurst, new jersey expenses and the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits. increased revenue and gross margin, coupled with the above changes, resulted in a combined 11% increase in net income for fiscal 2014.

license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer, which are not part of a bundled arrangement. we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution.
non-bundled license revenue decreased due mainly to a decrease in standalone license sales in our banking segment. such license fees will fluctuate as non-bundled license sales are sporadic in nature.

support and service revenues are generated from annual support to assist the customer in operating their systems and to enhance and update the software, electronic payment services, outsourced data processing services, implementation services (including conversion, installation, configuration and training) and revenue from our bundled software multi-element agreements.
in-house support and other services revenue increased due to annual maintenance renewal fee increases for both core and complementary products as our customers' assets grew. the increase compared to the prior year was consistent across all four fiscal quarters.
electronic payment services continued to experience the largest dollar growth. the revenue increases were attributable to strong performance across debit/credit card transaction processing services, online bill payment services and ach processing. the increase compared to the prior year was consistent across all four fiscal quarters.
outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continued to drive revenue growth as customers continued to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions. we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to
24
benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future. revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multi-year service contracts and therefore provide a long-term stream of recurring revenues.
implementation services include implementation services for our outsourcing and electronic payment services customers as well as standalone customization services, merger conversion services, image conversion services and network monitoring services. implementation services revenue increased due mainly to increased implementations of our credit union core products, particularly in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year.
bundled products and services revenue is combined revenue from the multiple elements in our bundled arrangements, including license, implementation services and maintenance, which cannot be recognized separately due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value. bundled products and services revenue decreased from last year mainly due to decreased revenues from our core and complementary banking products, particularly image solutions, throughout the fiscal year. additionally, the decrease was furthered due to a decrease in core credit union products in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior year.

the company has entered into remarketing agreements with several hardware manufacturers under which we sell computer hardware, hardware maintenance and related services to our customers. revenue related to hardware sales is recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers.
hardware revenue decreased slightly. although there will be continuing quarterly fluctuations, we expect there to be an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts, which typically do not include hardware, and the general deflationary trend of computer prices.
cost of sales and gross profit cost of license represented the cost of software from third party vendors through remarketing agreements associated with non-bundled application software licenses. these costs were recognized when license revenue was recognized. cost of support and service represented costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts, ongoing support for our in-house customers, operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers, electronic payment services and direct operating costs. these costs were recognized as they were incurred or, for direct costs associated with obtaining and implementing our bundled arrangements, deferred and recognized ratably as the related revenues for these arrangements are recognized, which typically begins when pcs is the only remaining undelivered element, and ends at the end of the initial bundled pcs term. cost of hardware consisted of the direct and indirect costs of purchasing the equipment from the manufacturers and delivery to our customers. these costs were recognized at the same time as the related hardware revenue was recognized. ongoing operating costs to provide support to our customers were recognized as they were incurred.

in general, changes in cost of hardware trended consistently with hardware revenue. for the fiscal year, margins are slightly lower due to decreased sales of higher margin hardware upgrade products.

in fiscal 2015, revenue in the credit union systems and services reportable segment increased 7% due to increases in support & service revenue. support & service revenues grew 7% through increases in electronic payment services, in-house maintenance renewals, and outsourcing services. gross profit margins for the credit union segment increased mainly due economies of scale realized from growing transaction volume in our payment processing services.
in fiscal 2014, revenue in the credit union segment increased 3% over the prior year, driven by support & service revenue. in particular, electronic payment services increased due to the continuing growth of our transaction processing and debit/credit card processing services and in-house maintenance renewal revenues also increased. gross profit margins for the credit union segment increased mainly due to economies of scale realized from growing transaction volume in our payment processing services.
liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements. we expect this trend to continue in the future.
the company's cash and cash equivalents increased to $148,313 at june 30, 2015 from $70,377 at june 30, 2014. the increase from june 30, 2014 is primarily due to borrowings made on our revolving credit facility during the year and fewer repurchases of treasury stock in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year.

net cash provided by operating activities      $373,790              $341,659
cash provided by operating activities increased 9% compared to last year. cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase stock and for capital expenditures.
cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015 totaled $136,984 and included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of $54,409, which mainly included the purchase of aircraft and computer equipment, $76,872 for the development of software and $14,020 for the purchase and development of internal use software. these expenditures were partially offset by $8,317 proceeds received primarily from sale of aircraft. cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014 totaled $131,780 and included capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of $33,185, which mainly included the purchase of aircraft and computer equipment. other uses of cash included $27,894 of payments for the acquisition of banno, $62,194 for the development of software and
28
$16,288 for the purchase and development of internal use software. these expenditures were partially offset by $7,781 proceeds received primarily from sale of aircraft.
financing activities used cash of $158,870 during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. cash used was mainly dividends paid to stockholders of $76,410, $122,691 for the purchase of treasury shares, repayment of the revolving credit facility of $20,000, and repayment of capital leases of $10,783. cash used was partially offset by borrowings against the revolving credit facility of $90,000, and $1,915 net proceeds from the issuance of stock and taxes related to stock-based compensation. financing activities used cash of $267,407 during fiscal 2014. cash used was mainly dividends paid to stockholders of $71,251, $175,699 for the purchase of treasury shares, and repayments of capital leases of $22,158. cash used was partially offset by $1,701 net proceeds from the issuance of stock and taxes related to stock-based compensation. during the fourth quarter, the company also borrowed $25,000 against its revolving line of credit and the full amount of the borrowing was repaid in the same period.
the company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements. capital expenditures in the fiscal year were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities. these additions were funded from cash generated by operations. at june 30, 2015, the company had $19,790 of purchase commitments related to property and equipment. we anticipate that these commitments will be funded by cash generated by operations.
the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock. under this authorization, the company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or short-term borrowings on its existing credit facilities. the share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time. at june 30, 2015, there were 21,843 shares in treasury stock and the company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 8,148 additional shares. the total cost of treasury shares at june 30, 2015 is $700,472. during fiscal 2015, the company repurchased 2,048 treasury shares for $122,691. at june 30, 2014, there were 19,795 shares in treasury stock and the company had authority to repurchase up to 5,196 additional shares.
on august 21, 2015, the company's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share on its common stock, payable on september 25, 2015 to shareholders of record on september 4, 2015. current funds from operations are adequate for this purpose. the board has indicated that it plans to continue paying dividends as long as the company's financial picture continues to be favorable.
capital leases the company has entered into various capital lease obligations for the use of certain computer equipment. long term capital lease obligations were entered into of which $816 remains outstanding at june 30, 2015 and $714 will be maturing within the next twelve months. the company also has short term capital lease obligations totaling $1,881 at june 30, 2015. included in property and equipment are assets under capital leases totaling $16,833, which have accumulated depreciation totaling $4,563.
revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility allows for borrowings of up to $300,000, which may be increased by the company at any time until maturity to $600,000. the credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to (a) a rate based on libor or (b) an alternate base rate (the highest of (i) the prime rate for such day, (ii) the sum of the federal funds effective rate for such day plus 0.50% and (iii) the eurocurrency rate for a one month interest period on such day for dollars plus 1.0%), plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the company's leverage ratio. the credit facility is secured by pledges of capital stock of certain subsidiaries of the company and also guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the company. the credit facility is subject to various financial covenants that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement. as of june 30, 2015, the company was in compliance with all such covenants. the revolving loan terminates february 20, 2020 and at june 30, 2015, the outstanding revolving loan balance was $50,000.
other lines of credit the company renewed an unsecured bank credit line on march 3, 2014 which provides for funding of up to $5,000 and bears interest at the prime rate less 1%. the credit line was renewed through april 30, 2017. at june 30, 2015, no amount was outstanding.
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations at june 30, 2015, the company's total off balance sheet contractual obligations were $46,357. this balance consists of $26,567 of long-term operating leases for various facilities and equipment which expire from 2016 to 2021 and $19,790 of purchase commitments related to property and equipment. the contractual obligations table below excludes
29
$7,696 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement.

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014. the new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition. in august 2015, the fasb also issued asu no. 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year. the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning july 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. along with the deferral of the effective date, asu no. 2015-14 allows early application as of the original effective date. entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption. the company is currently evaluating the newly issued guidance, including which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb also issued asu no. 2015-03, interest-imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. this asu requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability (same treatment as debt discounts). asu 2015-3 is effective for the company in fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. the company will adopt these changes for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017.
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("u.s. gaap"). the significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.
we have identified several critical accounting estimates. an accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission. the application of these pronouncements requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements, and whether vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of fair value exists for those elements. customers receive certain elements of our products and services over time. changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and deferred revenue reflected in the financial statements.
license arrangements: for software license agreements, the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product or service has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable. for arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until
30
payments become due. the company's software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or "elements." generally, none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements.
for multiple element arrangements, which contain software elements and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the non-software deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement. for our non-software deliverables, we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price ("esp"). for our software elements, we use vsoe for this allocation when it can be established and esp when vsoe cannot be established.
the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vsoe if available, third party evidence ("tpe") if vsoe is not available, or esp if neither vsoe or tpe are available. generally, we are not able to determine tpe because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. esp is determined after considering both market conditions (such as the sale of similar products in the market place) and entity-specific factors (such as pricing practices and the specifics of each transaction).
for our non-software deliverables, a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has standalone value and if the customer has a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially within our control.
for our software licenses and related services, including the software elements of multiple-element software and non-software arrangements, u.s. gaap generally require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value. vsoe of fair value is determined for implementation services based on a rate per hour for stand-alone professional services and the estimated hours for the bundled implementation, if the hours can be reasonably estimated. vsoe of fair value is determined for post-contract support ("pcs") based upon the price charged when sold separately. for a majority of the elements within our software arrangements, we have determined that vsoe cannot be established; therefore, revenue on our software arrangements is generally deferred until the only remaining element is pcs. at that point, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period, assuming that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. the amounts deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as bundled products & services revenue within support & service revenue in the income statement.
for arrangements that include specified upgrades, such upgrades are accounted for as a separate element of the arrangement. for those specified upgrades for which vsoe of fair value cannot be determined, revenue related to the software elements within the arrangement is deferred until such specified upgrades have been delivered.
support and service fee revenue (non-software): maintenance support revenue contracted for outside of a license arrangement is recognized pro-rata over the contract period, typically one year.
outsourced data processing and atm, debit card, and other transaction processing services revenue is recognized in the month the transactions are processed or the services are rendered.
hardware revenue: hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer, when title and risk of loss are transferred. in most cases, we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell, but arrange for third-party suppliers to drop-ship the products to our customers on our behalf. the revenue related to these hardware sales is recorded gross. the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers. hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period.
revenue-based taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis (i.e. excluded from revenues).
deferred costs costs for certain software and hardware maintenance contracts with third parties, which are prepaid, are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract, generally one to five years, with the related revenue amortized from deferred revenues.
direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements subject to accounting standards codification ("asc") 985-605 (for which vsoe of fair value cannot be established) are deferred until the only remaining element in the revenue arrangement is pcs at which point the costs are recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period with the related revenue. deferred direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements not subject to asc 985-605 consist primarily of certain up-front costs incurred in connection with our software hosting arrangements and are recognized ratably over the contract period which typically ranges from 5-7 years. these costs include commissions, costs of third-party licenses and the direct costs of our implementation services, consisting of payroll and other fringe benefits.

depreciation and amortization expense the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists. we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term, but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company's future consolidated operating results. all long-lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis.
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products. significant estimates and assumptions include: establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized, determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations.
estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly. considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. also, liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our financial results.
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment. liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition, and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value. third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecast revenues or profits on contract-related intangibles. numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by company professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired.
as goodwill is not amortized, goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment. such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values. cash flow projections are based on management-approved estimates, which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance, operations and program management. key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. the company's most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value. however, significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

item 1a. risk factors our business and operations are subject to many risks. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. unless the context requires otherwise, "we," "us," "our" and "eog" refer to eog resources, inc. and its subsidiaries.
crude oil, natural gas and ngl prices are volatile, and the substantial and extended decline in commodity prices has had, and may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on us and the trading price of our common stock.
prices for crude oil and natural gas (including prices for natural gas liquids (ngls) and condensate) fluctuate widely. among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are:
•   the level of consumer demand;
•   domestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil, ngls and natural gas;
•   the price and quantity of imported and exported crude oil, ngls and natural gas;
•   domestic and international drilling activity;
•   the actions of other crude oil exporting nations, including the organization of petroleum exporting countries;
•   weather conditions and changes in weather patterns;
•   the availability, proximity and capacity of appropriate transportation facilities, gathering, processing and compression facilities and refining facilities;
•   worldwide economic and political conditions, including political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions;
•   the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources;
•   the nature and extent of governmental regulation, including environmental regulation, regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities, tax laws and regulations and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities;
•   the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; and
•   the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures.
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2015 and into 2016, crude oil prices have substantially declined. in addition, natural gas and ngl prices began to decline substantially in the second quarter of 2014, and such declines continued during 2015 and into 2016. the above-described factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict future crude oil, natural gas and ngl prices. as a result, we cannot predict how long these lower prices will continue, and there can be no assurance that the prices for crude oil, natural gas and/or ngls will not decline further.
our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices. accordingly, the recent substantial and extended decline in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations.
lower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil, natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically. substantial declines in the prices of these commodities can also render uneconomic a significant portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects, resulting in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. as a result, prolonged or substantial declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to finance our capital expenditures and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock.
in addition, significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values, which will require us to write down the value of our properties. such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
in fact, the substantial declines in crude oil, natural gas and ngl prices that began in 2014 and which have continued into 2016 have materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our results of operations during fiscal year 2015 and the trading price of our common stock.
13
as a result of the decreased cash flow available for capital expenditures, we have delayed our drilling and completion plans with respect to certain of our properties. these delays may result in impacts to our production volumes as well as cause us to potentially shut-in certain wells and incur associated lease payment obligations. such commodity price declines also resulted in an impairment charge (i.e., "write-down") of $6.3 billion in 2015 with respect to our proved oil and gas properties and related assets. such declines in commodity prices also resulted in our making a downward adjustment of 574 million barrels of oil equivalent to our estimated net proved reserves at december 31, 2015.
in addition, our 2016 financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be adversely affected if commodity prices remain at current levels or decline further. if commodity prices remain at current levels for an extended period of time or continue to decline, we may be limited in our ability to maintain our current level of dividends on our common stock. further, if commodity prices remain at current levels or decline further, we may be required to incur additional impairment charges and/or make significant additional downward adjustments to our proved reserve estimates. as a result, our financial condition and results of operations will be further adversely affected.
drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control.
drilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves (including "dry holes"). as a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells.
specifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including:
•   unexpected drilling conditions;
•   title problems;
•   pressure or irregularities in formations;
•   equipment failures or accidents;
•   adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and changes in weather patterns;
•   compliance with, or changes in, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, access to and use of water, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas, and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations;
•   the availability and timely issuance of required federal, state, tribal and other permits and licenses, which may be affected by (among other things) government shutdowns or other suspensions of, or delays in, government services;
•   the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including mineral licenses and leases, pipelines, rail cars, crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, transport and market crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; and
•   the costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing services, pressure pumping equipment and supplies, tubular materials, water, sand, disposal facilities, qualified personnel and other necessary facilities, equipment, materials, supplies and services.
our failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally, see the immediately following risk factor.
14
our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities, and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities.
our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for, and producing, gathering, processing, compressing and transporting, crude oil and natural gas, including the risks of:
•   well blowouts and cratering;
•   loss of well control;
•   crude oil spills, natural gas leaks and pipeline ruptures;
•   pipe failures and casing collapses;
•   uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, formation water or drilling fluids;
•   releases of chemicals, wastes or pollutants;
•   adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and other natural disasters;
•   fires and explosions;
•   terrorism, vandalism and physical, electronic and cyber security breaches;
•   formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures;
•   leaks or spills in connection with, or associated with, the gathering, processing, compression and transportation of crude oil and natural gas; and
•   malfunctions of, or damage to, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment and other facilities and equipment utilized in support of our crude oil and natural gas operations.
if any of these events occur, we could incur losses, liabilities and other additional costs as a result of:
•   injury or loss of life;
•   damage to, or destruction of, property, facilities, equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs;
•   pollution or other environmental damage;
•   regulatory investigations and penalties as well as clean-up and remediation responsibilities and costs;
•   suspension or interruption of our operations, including due to injunction;
•   repairs necessary to resume operations; and
•   compliance with laws and regulations enacted as a result of such events.
we maintain insurance against many, but not all, such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage, would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable.
the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties. these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. in particular, in certain newer plays, the capacity of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells. in addition, lack of financing, construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment by third parties or us, and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines, gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery.
any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering, processing, compression or transportation facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.
15
if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels.
the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced. except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration, exploitation and development activities, acquire additional properties containing reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our reserves will decline as they are produced. maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. to the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future cash flows and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.
we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future.
our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal, state, tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies, both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business, and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental, health, safety or other considerations. moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, health, safety and other regulations. further, the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
specifically, as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, tribal, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. these regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. moreover, we are subject to the united states (u.s.) environmental protection agency's (u.s. epa) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
local, state, national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years. for example, the u.s. epa recently proposed regulations that would require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds from crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations, gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations. in december 2015, the u.s. participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris, france. the paris agreement (adopted at the conference) calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and ghg emissions. if ratified, the paris agreement will take effect in 2020. it is possible that the paris agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil, natural gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for, and production of, crude oil, natural gas and other fossil fuel products. eog is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations, laws, regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions, but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations, laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect eog's operations, financial condition and results of operations.
the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements. in march 2015, however, the u.s. bureau of land management issued new regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and indian lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity, and handling of flow back and produced water. in addition, there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level. any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements, additional operating and compliance costs and additional operating restrictions. moreover, some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations. any such federal or state requirements, restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. accordingly, our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected. for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation, see climate change - united states and hydraulic fracturing - united states under item 1, business - regulation.
16
we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. we are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. for related discussion, see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities (such as eog) that participate in such transactions.
certain u.s. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may cease to be available in the future or may be otherwise modified as a result of future legislation.
legislation may be proposed in the future that could, if enacted into law, make significant changes to u.s. tax laws. such changes may include, but not be limited to, the elimination of certain u.s. federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, such as with respect to the intangible drilling costs deduction and bonus tax depreciation. we can give no assurance whether such changes or similar or other tax law changes will be proposed and, if enacted, how soon any such changes would become effective. the enactment of any such changes in u.s. federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us.
a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including, but not limited to, as a result of accidents, weather conditions, the unavailability of gathering, processing, compression, transportation or refining facilities or equipment or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic. if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in, our cash flows and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.
some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. as a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. in addition, a third-party operator could also decide to shut-in or curtail production from wells, or plug and abandon marginal wells, on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices. these limitations and our dependence on the operator and third-party working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
from time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems (such as title or environmental issues), nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. in addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. in addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.
17
we have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.
we make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas reserves. we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations, commercial paper borrowings, sales of non-core assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings.
lower crude oil and natural gas prices, however, reduce our cash flows. the lower commodity price environment could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned non-core asset sales and divestitures. further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. weakness and/or volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions and a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings. a reduction in our cash flows (for example, as a result of continued lower crude oil and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shut-ins) and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay. in addition, a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our ability to obtain financings and the terms of any financings are, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels; planned asset purchases or sales; near-term and long-term production growth opportunities; liquidity; asset quality; cost structure; product mix; and commodity pricing levels (including, but not limited to, the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices). in february 2016, standard & poor's ratings services (an independent credit rating agency), as a result of its lowered assumptions with respect to future commodity prices, lowered its credit ratings of several investment grade-rated u.s. oil and gas exploration and production companies, including its rating of our long-term debt. we expect moody's investors service, inc. (also an independent credit rating agency) will take similar action in the near future with respect to its ratings of our debt and its ratings of the debt of other u.s. oil and gas exploration and production companies. such ratings downgrades could increase our borrowing costs and may adversely impact our ability to access financings. in addition, we cannot provide any assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future, nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be further lowered.
the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us.
we have various customers for the crude oil, natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions. domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, while weakened in recent years, have improved somewhat. however, there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and a depressed commodity price environment, and there is the possibility that lenders may react by tightening credit. these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes.
moreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions. furthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil, natural gas or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production, the availability, proximity or capacity of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions.
the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
18
competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have.
we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and access to the facilities, equipment, materials, services and employees and other contract personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) necessary to explore for, develop, produce, market and transport crude oil and natural gas. in addition, many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services, facilities, equipment, materials and personnel. in addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels. we also face competition, to a lesser extent, from competing energy sources, such as alternative energy sources.
reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated.
estimating quantities of crude oil, ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process. it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants. any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. also, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil, ngl and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. we also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, gathering, processing, compression and transportation costs, severance, ad valorem and other applicable taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, many of which factors are or may be beyond our control. our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. any significant variance, including any significant revisions or "write-downs" to our existing reserve estimates, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. for related discussion, see item 2, properties - oil and gas exploration and production - properties and reserves and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements.
weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us.
demand for crude oil and natural gas is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities we produce and, in turn, our cash flows and results of operations. for example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, lower prices for natural gas production.
in addition, our exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment. such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.
19
our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk.
we use derivative instruments (primarily financial price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows. to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts. our forecasted natural gas production for 2016 is currently approximately 4% hedged at approximately $2.49 per million british thermal units, and none of our forecasted crude oil production for 2016 is currently hedged. as a result, a significant portion of our forecasted production for 2016 remains unhedged and subject to fluctuating market prices. if we are ultimately unable to hedge additional production volumes for 2016 and beyond, we will be impacted by further commodity price declines, which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities. in addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts.
federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities.
as discussed in the risk factor immediately above, we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows. in 2010, congress adopted the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (dodd-frank act), which, among other matters, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission (cftc), the securities and exchange commission (sec) and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors (the prudential regulators) adopt rules or regulations implementing the dodd-frank act and providing definitions of terms used in the dodd-frank act. the dodd-frank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities. although some of the rules necessary to implement the dodd-frank act are yet to be adopted, the cftc, the sec and the prudential regulators have issued numerous rules, including a rule establishing an "end-user" exception to mandatory clearing (end-user exception), a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps (margin rule) and a proposed rule imposing position limits (position limits rule).
we qualify as a "non-financial entity" for purposes of the end-user exception and, as such, we are eligible for, and expect to utilize, such exception. as a result, our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing. we also qualify as a "non-financial entity" for purposes of the margin rule; therefore, our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements. finally, we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted. however, many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants may not be eligible for the end-user exception, may be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties, and/or may be subject to the position limits rule. in addition, the european union and other non-u.s. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives (collectively, foreign regulations) which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations.
the dodd-frank act, the rules adopted thereunder and the foreign regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts, alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the dodd-frank act, related regulations or the foreign regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile, and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for, and fund, our capital expenditure requirements. any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team.
our business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. the loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
20
we operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks.
our operations in jurisdictions outside the u.s. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. these risks include, among other risks:
•   increases in taxes and governmental royalties;
•   changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies;
•   loss of revenue, loss of or damage to equipment, property and other assets and interruption of operations as a result of expropriation, nationalization, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks;
•   unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities;
•   difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and
•   currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations.
our international operations may also be adversely affected by u.s. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation. the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.
the reporting currency for our financial statements is the u.s. dollar. however, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the u.s. and have functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency. these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2015, less than 1% of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the u.s. dollar.
our business could be adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats.
as a producer of crude oil and natural gas, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable, and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering and processing facilities, refineries, rail facilities and pipelines. the potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruptions, or other disruptions to our operations.
our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information, systems, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. if any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of, or damage to, sensitive information or facilities, infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations, as well as data corruption, communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us.
terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. the u.s. government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview eog resources, inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, eog), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states, trinidad, the united kingdom and china.  eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries.  this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing eog to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves.  maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eog's strategy.
eog realized a net loss of $4,525 million during 2015 as compared to net income of $2,915 million for 2014. during 2015, impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other assets totaling $6,326 million, $4,141 million net of tax, were recognized primarily due to the decline in commodity prices. at december 31, 2015, eog's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,118 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), a decrease of 379 mmboe from december 31, 2014.  during 2015, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (ngls) reserves decreased by 126 million barrels (mmbbl), and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 1,517 billion cubic feet or 253 mmboe.
operations several important developments have occurred since january 1, 2015.
united states. eog's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, eog's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. during 2015, eog focused on increasing drilling and completion efficiencies, testing methods to improve the recovery factor of oil-in-place and reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions. these efficiency gains along with realized lower service costs resulted in lower drilling and completion costs and decreased operating expenses. eog continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. on a volumetric basis, as calculated using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and ngl production accounted for approximately 71% of united states production during 2015, consistent with 2014. during 2015, drilling occurred primarily in the eagle ford, delaware basin and north dakota bakken plays, where eog has built an inventory of uncompleted wells. in addition, eog continues to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins or tactical acquisitions and to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. in 2015, eog completed four transactions to acquire certain proved crude oil properties and related assets in the delaware basin. the aggregate purchase price of the transactions totaled approximately $400 million. eog's major producing areas in the united states are in new mexico, north dakota, texas, utah and wyoming.
during 2015, due to the decline in commodity prices, proved oil and gas properties and related assets in the united states were written down to their fair value resulting in pretax impairment charges of $6,130 million, $3,945 million net of tax. impairments were related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays.
trinidad. in trinidad, eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. several fields in the south east coast consortium (secc) block, modified u(a) block, block 4(a) and modified u(b) block and the sercan area (formerly known as the emz area) have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited. eog completed three net wells in 2015, finishing its secc block and modified u(b) block drilling program that was initiated in 2014. in 2016, eog expects to complete one net well and install infrastructure in the sercan area.
other international.  as previously reported, during the fourth quarter of 2014, eog completed the divestiture of substantially all its assets in canada (see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). at the time of the sales, production from the divested assets totaled approximately 7,050 barrels of crude oil per day, 580 barrels of ngls per day and 43.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. information related to eog's remaining canadian operations is presented in the "other international" segment.
29
in the united kingdom, eog continues to make progress in the development of its 100% working interest east irish sea conwy crude oil discovery. modifications to the nearby third-party owned douglas platform, which will be used to process conwy production, began in 2013 and continued throughout 2014 and 2015. first production from the conwy field is anticipated in march 2016. during 2015, eog recognized a pretax impairment charge of $186 million for the conwy project as a result of crude oil price declines.
in 2015, eog drilled four wells and completed three wells, one of which was drilled in 2014, in the sichuan basin, sichuan province, china. the successful completions extended the shaximiao development in the chuan zhong block and provides additional opportunities in the future.
eog's activity in argentina is focused on the vaca muerta oil shale formation in the neuquén province. management is currently evaluating options for its investment.
eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.
capital structure one of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in eog's peer group.  eog's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 34% at december 31, 2015 and 25% at december 31, 2014.  as used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. at december 31, 2015, $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.500% senior notes due 2016 (the 2016 notes) and $260 million principal amount of commercial paper borrowings were reclassified as long-term debt based upon eog's intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other long-term debt.
on january 14, 2016, eog closed its sale of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.15% senior notes due 2026 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.10% senior notes due 2036 (collectively, the new notes). interest on the new notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year, beginning july 15, 2016. proceeds from the issuance of the new notes totaled approximately $991 million and were used to repay the $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 notes when such notes came due on february 1, 2016 and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of future capital expenditures.
on july 21, 2015, eog entered into a new $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (2015 agreement) with domestic and foreign lenders (banks). the 2015 agreement replaced eog's $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which was canceled by eog upon the closing of the 2015 agreement. the 2015 agreement has a scheduled maturity date of july 21, 2020, and includes an option for eog to extend, on up to two occasions, the term for successive one-year periods, subject to certain terms and conditions. the 2015 agreement commits the banks to provide advances up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion at any one time outstanding, with an option for eog to request increases in the aggregate commitments to an amount not to exceed $3.0 billion, subject to certain terms and conditions.
on june 1, 2015, eog repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95% senior notes due 2015.
on march 17, 2015, eog closed its sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.15% senior notes due 2025 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.90% senior notes due 2035 (together, the notes). interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning on october 1, 2015. net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately $990 million were used for general corporate purposes.
during 2015, eog funded $5.2 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid at maturity $500 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $367 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $49 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities, net proceeds from the sale of the notes, commercial paper borrowings, net proceeds of $193 million from the sale of assets and $26 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation.
total anticipated 2016 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. the majority of 2016 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities. eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under the 2015 agreement and equity and debt offerings.
30
when it fits eog's strategy, eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eog's history.
results of operations the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2015, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f-1.
net operating revenues during 2015, net operating revenues decreased $9,278 million, or 51%, to $8,757 million from $18,035 million in 2014. total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of eog's production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, decreased $6,188 million, or 49%, to $6,404 million in 2015 from $12,592 million in 2014. revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2015 were approximately 83% of total wellhead revenues compared to 85% in 2014. during 2015, eog recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million compared to net gains of $834 million in 2014. gathering, processing and marketing revenues decreased $1,793 million during 2015, to $2,253 million from $4,046 million in 2014. net losses on asset dispositions totaled $9 million in 2015 compared to net gains on asset dispositions of $508 million in 2014.

2015 compared to 2014. wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2015 decreased $4,807 million, or 49%, to $4,935 million from $9,742 million in 2014, due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($4,677 million) and a decrease of 5 mbbld, or 2%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($131 million). the decrease in deliveries primarily reflects decreased production in the north dakota bakken, the fort worth barnett shale area and other international, partially offset by increased production in the permian basin and eagle ford. the decrease in other international is due to the sale of the canadian assets. eog's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2015 decreased 49% to $47.53 per barrel compared to $92.58 per barrel in 2014.
ngl revenues in 2015 decreased $526 million, or 56%, to $408 million from $934 million in 2014, due to a lower composite average price ($490 million) and a decrease of 3 mbbld, or 4%, in ngl deliveries ($36 million). eog's composite ngl price in 2015 decreased 55% to $14.49 per barrel compared to $31.91 per barrel in 2014.
wellhead natural gas revenues in 2015 decreased $855 million, or 45%, to $1,061 million from $1,916 million in 2014, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($730 million) and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($125 million). eog's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 41% to $2.30 per mcf in 2015 compared to $3.88 per mcf in 2014. natural gas deliveries in 2015 decreased 7% to 1,265 mmcfd as compared to 1,353 mmcfd in 2014. the decrease in production was due to decreased production in other international (40 mmcfd), the united states (34 mmcfd) and trinidad (14 mmcfd). in the united states, decreased production was due primarily to lower production in the upper gulf coast, fort worth barnett shale and south texas areas, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the eagle ford and permian basin. the decline in other international primarily reflects the sale of the canadian assets.
during 2015, eog recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $730 million. during 2014, eog recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $834 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $34 million.
gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, ngls, and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of eog-owned sand. purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eog-owned facilities. marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with eog-owned sand sold to third parties.
gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2015 declined $53 million compared to 2014, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and natural gas marketing activities and losses on sand sales.
2014 compared to 2013.  wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2014 increased $1,441 million, or 17%, to $9,742 million from $8,301 million in 2013, due to an increase of 68.5 mbbld, or 31%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($2,558 million), partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,117 million).  the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the eagle ford, the north dakota bakken and the permian basin.  eog's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2014 decreased 10% to $92.58 per barrel compared to $103.20 per barrel in 2013.
ngl revenues in 2014 increased $160 million, or 21%, to $934 million from $774 million in 2013, due to an increase of 15 mbbld, or 23%, in ngl deliveries ($179 million), partially offset by a lower composite average price ($19 million).  the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the eagle ford and the permian basin.  eog's composite ngl price in 2014 decreased 2% to $31.91 per barrel compared to $32.55 per barrel in 2013.
wellhead natural gas revenues in 2014 increased $235 million, or 14%, to $1,916 million from $1,681 million in 2013, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price.  eog's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 13% to $3.88 per mcf in 2014 compared to $3.42 per mcf in 2013.  natural gas deliveries in 2014 increased less than 1% to 1,353 mmcfd as compared to 1,347 mmcfd in 2013. increased production in the united states (12 mmcfd) and trinidad (8 mmcfd) was offset by lower production in canada (15 mmcfd). in the united states, increased production of associated natural gas in the eagle ford and permian basin areas was partially offset by lower production in the upper gulf coast and fort worth basin barnett shale areas.

during 2014, eog recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $834 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $34 million. during 2013, eog recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $116 million.
gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2014 declined $75 million compared to 2013, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities.
operating and other expenses
2015 compared to 2014.  during 2015, operating expenses of $15,444 million were $2,650 million higher than the $12,794 million incurred during 2014.  operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties, other property, plant and equipment and other assets of $6,326 million primarily due to commodity price declines. the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014:

the primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, dd&a, g&a and net interest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 are set forth below.  see "net operating revenues" above for a discussion of production volumes.
lease and well expenses include expenses for eog-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property.  lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses.  operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power.  workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.
each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations.  eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas.  operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors, fluctuate over time.
lease and well expenses of $1,182 million in 2015 decreased $234 million from $1,416 million in 2014 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the united states ($125 million), lower lease and well expenses in other international ($99 million) primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets and lower workover expenditures in the united states ($21 million), partially offset by increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states ($12 million).
transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale.  transportation costs include transportation fees, costs associated with crude-by-rail operations, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.
34
transportation costs of $849 million in 2015 decreased $123 million from $972 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the rocky mountain area ($81 million) and the eagle ford ($48 million) primarily due to an increase in the use of pipelines to transport crude oil production, partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production from the permian basin ($19 million).
dd&a of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  eog's dd&a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dd&a group calculations.  there are several factors that can impact eog's composite dd&a rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments.  changes to these factors may cause eog's composite dd&a rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period.  dd&a of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets.
dd&a expenses in 2015 decreased $683 million to $3,314 million from $3,997 million in 2014.  dd&a expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2015 were $691 million lower than in 2014 primarily due to lower unit rates in the united states ($513 million) and trinidad ($28 million), a decrease in production in the united states ($44 million) and lower dd&a expense in other international ($104 million) primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets.  unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to impairments of proved oil and gas properties (see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements), upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.
g&a expenses of $367 million in 2015 were $35 million lower than 2014 primarily due to lower employee-related expenses.
net interest expense of $237 million in 2015 was $36 million higher than 2014 primarily due to interest incurred on the notes issued in march 2015 ($28 million), as well as a decrease in capitalized interest ($15 million). this was partially offset by the reduction of interest on debt repaid in june 2015 and during 2014 ($11 million).
exploration costs of $149 million in 2015 decreased $35 million from $184 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states ($19 million) and lower exploration administrative expenses in other international ($10 million) primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets.
impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs; as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets.  unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dd&a group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards board's accounting standards codification (asc).  in certain instances, eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value.
impairments of $6,614 million in 2015 increased $5,870 million from $744 million in 2014 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the united states ($5,959 million), primarily due to commodity price declines; and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states ($112 million), which was caused by higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in eog's estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration; partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in the united kingdom ($156 million) and argentina ($43 million). proved property and other asset impairments in the united states were primarily related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays. eog recorded impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $6,326 million and $575 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes.  severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.
taxes other than income in 2015 decreased $336 million to $422 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) from $758 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) in 2014. the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in severance/production taxes ($307 million), primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues and lower ad valorem/property taxes ($17 million), both in the united states.
35
other income, net, was $2 million in 2015 compared to other expense, net, of $45 million in 2014. the increase of $47 million was primarily due to a decrease in net foreign currency transaction losses and decreased deferred compensation expense.
eog recognized an income tax benefit of $2,397 million in 2015 compared to an income tax expense of $2,080 million in 2014 primarily due to impairments recognized in the united states in 2015. the net effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 35% from 42% in the prior year primarily due to the effects of recording valuation allowances in the united kingdom and deferred tax in the united states related to undistributed foreign earnings in 2014.
2014 compared to 2013.  during 2014, operating expenses of $12,794 million were $1,982 million higher than the $10,812 million incurred during 2013.  the following table presents the costs per boe for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013:

the primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, dd&a, g&a and net interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013 are set forth below.  see "net operating revenues" above for a discussion of production volumes.
lease and well expenses of $1,416 million in 2014 increased $310 million from $1,106 million in 2013 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs ($209 million), increased workover expenditures ($69 million) and increased lease and well administrative expenses ($32 million), all in the united states.
transportation costs of $972 million in 2014 increased $119 million from $853 million in 2013 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the eagle ford ($99 million) and the rocky mountain area ($15 million).
dd&a expenses in 2014 increased $396 million to $3,997 million from $3,601 million in 2013.  dd&a expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2014 were $384 million higher than in 2013 primarily due to increased production in the united states ($630 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the united states ($191 million) and canada ($37 million) and a decrease in production in canada ($31 million).  unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.
g&a expenses of $402 million in 2014 were $54 million higher than 2013 primarily due to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations.
net interest expense of $201 million in 2014 was $34 million lower than 2013 primarily due to repayment of the $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% senior notes due 2013, the subsidiary debt and the floating rate notes ($31 million), as well as an increase in capitalized interest across the company ($8 million). this was partially offset by interest expense on the notes issued in march 2014 ($10 million).
gathering and processing costs increased $38 million to $146 million in 2014 compared to $108 million in 2013 primarily due to increased activities in the eagle ford.
exploration costs of $184 million in 2014 increased $23 million from $161 million in 2013 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states.
36
impairments of $744 million in 2014 increased $457 million from $287 million in 2013 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties in the united kingdom ($351 million), the united states ($145 million) and argentina ($39 million); and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states ($54 million); partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in canada ($67 million) and trinidad ($14 million); and lower impairments of other assets in the united states ($46 million). eog recorded impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $575 million and $172 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the 2014 and 2013 amounts include impairments of $503 million and $7 million, respectively, related to certain assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value.
taxes other than income in 2014 increased $134 million to $758 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) from $624 million (5.8% of wellhead revenues) in 2013.  the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($112 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valorem/property taxes ($34 million) in the united states, partially offset by an increase in credits available to eog in 2014 for texas high-cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($11 million).
other expense, net, was $45 million in 2014 compared to $3 million in 2013. the increase of $42 million was primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses.
income tax provision of $2,080 million in 2014 increased $840 million from $1,240 million in 2013 due primarily to higher pretax income.  the net effective tax rate for 2014 increased to 42% from 36% in the prior year. the net effective tax rate for 2014 exceeded the united states statutory tax rate (35%) due primarily to valuation allowances in the united kingdom and deferred tax in the united states related to eog's undistributed foreign earnings. eog no longer asserts that foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested abroad and therefore recorded deferred tax of $250 million on the accumulated balance of such earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014.
capital resources and liquidity cash flow the primary sources of cash for eog during the three-year period ended december 31, 2015, were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, proceeds from asset sales, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities.  the primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.
2015 compared to 2014.  net cash provided by operating activities of $3,595 million in 2015 decreased $5,054 million from $8,649 million in 2014 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($6,188 million), unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($591 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($25 million), partially offset by a decrease in cash operating expenses ($741 million), a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($696 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($302 million).
net cash used in investing activities of $5,320 million in 2015 decreased by $2,194 million from $7,514 million in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,795 million); and a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($439 million); partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($603 million); a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($377 million) and the release of restricted cash in 2014 ($60 million).
net cash provided by financing activities of $371 million in 2015 included net proceeds from the issuance of the notes ($990 million), net commercial paper borrowings ($260 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($26 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($23 million). cash used in financing activities in 2015 included repayments of long-term debt ($500 million), cash dividend payments ($367 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($49 million).
37
2014 compared to 2013.  net cash provided by operating activities of $8,649 million in 2014 increased $1,320 million from $7,329 million in 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,837 million), favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($391 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for interest expense ($38 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($662 million), an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($82 million) and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($48 million).
net cash used in investing activities of $7,514 million in 2014 increased by $1,199 million from $6,315 million in 2013 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($823 million); an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($364 million); and a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($191 million); partially offset by the release of restricted cash ($126 million) and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($52 million).
net cash used in financing activities of $328 million during 2014 included repayments of long-term debt ($500 million), cash dividend payments ($280 million), purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($127 million) and the settlement of a foreign currency swap ($32 million).  cash provided by financing activities in 2014 included net proceeds from the issuances of long-term debt ($496 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($99 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($22 million).

(1)   leasehold acquisitions included $5 million in both 2014 and 2013 related to non-cash property exchanges.
exploration and development expenditures of $4,875 million for 2015 were $2,834 million lower than the prior year primarily due to decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the united states ($2,189 million) and other international ($74 million); decreased facilities expenditures ($553 million), decreased leasehold acquisitions ($232 million), decreased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures ($19 million), and decreased capitalized interest ($11 million), all in the united states.  these decreases were partially offset by increased property acquisitions ($342 million) in the united states.  the 2015 exploration and development expenditures of $4,875 million included $4,007 million in development drilling and facilities, $481 million in property acquisitions, $345 million in exploration and $42 million in capitalized interest. the 2014 exploration and development expenditures of $7,709 million included $6,804 million in development drilling and facilities, $709 million in exploration, $139 million in property acquisitions and $57 million in capitalized interest. the 2013 exploration and development expenditures of $6,863 million included $5,952 million in development drilling and facilities, $742 million in exploration, $120 million in property acquisitions and $49 million in capitalized interest.
38
the level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors.  eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant.  while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog.

financing eog's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 34% at december 31, 2015, compared to 25% at december 31, 2014.  as used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.
at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, eog had outstanding $6,390 million and $5,890 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $6,524 million and $6,242 million, respectively.  the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to eog at year-end.  eog's debt is at fixed interest rates.  while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eog's senior notes, such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.
during 2015, eog funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of the notes, cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program and proceeds from asset sales.  while eog maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2015 was $641 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was $260 million.  there were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2015. the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were $81 million and zero, respectively, during the year 2015.  eog considers this excess availability, which is backed by its 2015 agreement described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.

(1)   this table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, eog's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to consolidated financial statements).
(2)   amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december 31, 2015. management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog.
(3)   amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. eog's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent eog utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if eog utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract).
off-balance sheet arrangements eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships.  such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (vie) or special purpose entities (spe), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.
foreign currency exchange rate risk during 2015, eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including trinidad, the united kingdom, china, canada and argentina.  the foreign currency most significant to eog's operations during 2015 was the british pound.  eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.

outlook pricing.  crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue.  as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, ngl and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future.  the market price of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in 2016 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact eog's financial position. as of february 12, 2016, the average 2016 u.s. new york mercantile exchange (nymex) crude oil and natural gas prices were $34.97 per barrel and $2.23 per mmbtu, respectively, representing declines of 28% and 17%, respectively, from the average nymex prices in 2015. see item 1a, risk factors.
based on eog's tax position, eog's price sensitivity in 2016 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in ngl price, is approximately $65 million for net income and $81 million for cash flows from operating activities.  including the impact of eog's 2016 natural gas derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on eog's tax position and the portion of eog's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2016 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, eog's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $15 million for net income and $18 million for cash flows from operating activities.  for information regarding eog's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at february 25, 2016, see "derivative transactions" above.
capital. eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states. in particular, eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford, delaware basin and bakken plays where it generates its highest rates-of-return. to further enhance the economics of these plays, eog expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs.
the total anticipated 2016 capital expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain eog's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows, net proceeds from the new notes and cash on hand. eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its 2015 agreement and equity and debt offerings.
operations. in 2016, both total production and total crude oil production are expected to decline slightly from 2015 levels. in 2016, eog expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements and lower service costs.

summary of critical accounting policies eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.  eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of eog's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application.  critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown.  management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies.  following is a discussion of eog's most critical accounting policies:
proved oil and gas reserves eog's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets.  proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made.  the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.  the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.  consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.  for related discussion, see item 1a, risk factors, and "supplemental information to consolidated financial statements."
oil and gas exploration costs eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting.  oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred.  the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves.  if proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed.  in some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed.  such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.  costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.
depreciation, depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eog's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.
depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  the reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves.  with respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves.  estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.
oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries - oil and gas topic of the asc.  the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.
depreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.
depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
42
impairments oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred.  unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  if the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties.  lease rentals are expensed as incurred.
when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  if the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on eog's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc.  in certain instances, eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value.  estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment.  crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future.  during the five years ended december 31, 2015, west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $34.55 per barrel to $113.39 per barrel, and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.63 per mmbtu to $8.15 per mmbtu.  eog's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available.  in the future, if actual crude oil and/or natural gas prices and/or actual production diverge negatively from eog's current estimates, impairment charges may be necessary.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach.  under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate.  significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates.  changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.
stock-based compensation in accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. assumptions regarding expected volatility of eog's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on eog's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility of the price of shares of eog's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

•   eog's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties;
•   the extent to which eog's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically;
•   competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for the acquisition of licenses, leases and properties, employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services;
•   the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water) and services;
•   the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise;
•   weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by eog or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression and transportation facilities;
•   the ability of eog's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to eog and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to eog;

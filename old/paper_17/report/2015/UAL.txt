item 1a.   risk factors.

the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the companys business and the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the companys business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report.
global economic, political and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable conditions may have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations.
the companys business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions. the airline industry is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the u.s. and global economies. the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives significant operating revenues. the companys international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network. volatile economic, political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the companys operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives.
robust demand for the companys air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions, including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies, low unemployment levels, strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit. air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times. in addition, during periods of unfavorable economic conditions, business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel, either due to cost-saving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel. during such periods, the companys business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand, particularly with respect to the companys business and premium cabin travelers, and a reduction in fare levels.
stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions, and any future volatility in u.s. and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the companys revenues, results of operations and liquidity. if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future, the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms (or at all) to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments.
in addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies may have a material adverse impact upon the companys liquidity, revenues, costs and operating results.
the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on the company.
the u.s. airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition including from low-cost carriers. the significant market presence of low-cost carriers, which engage in substantial price discounting, may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes.
airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity, including route systems and the number of markets served. several of the companys domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves, causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations. in addition, the company has implemented significant capacity reductions in recent years in response to high and volatile fuel prices and stagnant global economic growth. this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
11
terrorist attacks or international hostilities, or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities, even if not made directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect the company and the airline industry.
the terrorist attacks on september 11, 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as the prospects for the airline industry. among the effects experienced from the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faa-imposed temporary grounding of the u.s. airline industrys fleet, significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience, increased insurance costs, substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue.
additional terrorist attacks, even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks (including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights) could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry. wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. the companys financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities.
a significant data breach or the companys inability to comply with legislative or regulatory standards may adversely affect the companys business.
the company is subject to increasing legislative, regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security. a number of the companys commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that the company must meet and these standards continue to evolve. the company will continue its efforts to meet new and increasing privacy and security standards; however, it is possible that certain new standards may be difficult to meet and could increase the companys costs. additionally, any compromise of the companys technology systems could result in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to customers, employees or business partners information. any such loss, disclosure, misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information. any significant data breach or the companys failure to comply with applicable u.s. and foreign privacy or data security regulations or security standards imposed by the companys commercial partners may adversely affect the companys reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business.
the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business, including computerized airline reservation systems, flight operations systems, revenue management systems, accounting systems, telecommunication systems and commercial websites, including www.united.com. uniteds website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information, as well as process critical financial transactions. these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events, some of which are beyond the companys control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment or software failures, computer viruses or cyber security attacks. substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions, including failures or disruptions related to the companys complex integration of systems, could reduce the attractiveness of the companys services versus those of its competitors, materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights, result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, result in increased costs, lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data, and may adversely affect the companys business, results of operations and financial condition.
current or future litigation and regulatory actions could have a material adverse impact on the company.
from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies, including as described in part i, item 3 legal
12
proceedings of this annual report. no assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. an adverse resolution of lawsuits, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of non-monetary remedies. defending ourselves in these matters may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of managements time and attention from the operation of our business, which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives. additionally, any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment, settlement, fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance. under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into (and may in the future enter into) with our officers, directors and certain third parties, we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions, suits, investigations and other proceedings. there can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material.
disruptions to the companys regional network and united express flights provided by third-party regional carriers could adversely affect the companys operations and financial condition.
the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express. these regional operations are an extension of the companys mainline network and complement the companys operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. the companys business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network, with regional capacity accounting for approximately 12% of the companys total as of december 31, 2015.
although the company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics, the company does not control the operations of these carriers. a number of factors may impact the companys regional network, including weather-related effects and seasonality. in addition, the decrease in qualified pilots driven by federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the companys regional flying. for example, the faas expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards, including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1,500 total flight hours, as well as the faas revised pilot flight and duty time rules, effective january 2014, have contributed to an increasing need for pilots for regional carriers. the decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking u.s. military from which to hire qualified pilots, could adversely impact the companys operations and financial condition, and also require the company to reduce regional carrier flying.
if a significant disruption occurs to the companys regional network or flights or if one or more of the regional carriers with which the company has relationships is unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, there could be a material adverse effect on the companys business, financial condition and operations.
the companys business relies extensively on third-party service providers. failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in the companys relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company, could have an adverse effect on the companys financial position and results of operations.
the company has engaged an increasing number of third-party service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business, including regional operations, operation of customer service call centers, distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, provision of information technology infrastructure and services, transmitting or uploading of data, provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs, provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations, among other vital functions and services. the company does not directly control these third-party service providers, although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance. any of these third-party service providers, however, may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company, may suffer disruptions to their systems that could impact their services, or the agreements with such providers may be terminated. for example, flight reservations booked by customers and travel agencies via third-party gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators. such disruptions, including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to
13
renegotiation, may cause the companys flight information to be limited or unavailable for display, significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users, and impair the companys relationships with its customers and travel agencies. the failure of any of the companys third-party service providers to perform their service obligations adequately, or other interruptions of services, may reduce the companys revenues and increase its expenses, prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to its brand. in addition, the companys business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory.
the company could experience adverse publicity, harm to its brand, reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident, catastrophe, or incident involving its aircraft, the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners, which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial position.
an accident, catastrophe, or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates, or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the companys regional carriers, could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident, catastrophe, or incident created a public perception that the companys operations, or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers, are not safe or reliable, or are less safe or reliable than other airlines. such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company, cause harm to the companys brand and reduce travel demand on the companys flights, or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers.
in addition, any such accident, catastrophe, or incident could expose the company to significant tort liability. although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe, and the companys codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations, if the companys liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it, the company could incur substantial losses from an accident, catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial position.
if we experience changes in, or are unable to retain, our senior management team or other key employees, our operating results could be adversely affected.
much of our future success depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge, including our senior management team and other key employees. if we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key employees, or if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, our business may be adversely affected.
high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the companys strategic plans, operating results, financial position and liquidity.
aircraft fuel is critical to the companys operations and is one of its largest operating expenses. aircraft fuel has also been the companys most volatile operating expense for the past several years. the company generally sources adequate supplies of fuel at prevailing market prices and has some ability to store fuel close to major hub locations to ensure supply continuity in the short term. timely and adequate supply of aircraft fuel depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources and delivery infrastructure. although the company has some ability to cover short-term supply and infrastructure disruptions at its major demand locations, it can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the companys system.
market prices for aircraft fuel depend on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the companys control. these factors include changes in global crude oil prices, aircraft fuel supply-demand balance, inventory levels and fuel production and transportation capacity, as well as indirect factors, such as geopolitical events, economic
14
growth indicators, fiscal/monetary policies, fuel tax policies and financial investments. both actual changes as well as changes in market expectations of these factors can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel price levels and price volatility.
given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, the company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices, especially if these increases are significant, rapid and sustained. further, such fare and fee increases may not be sustainable, may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the companys strategic growth and investment plans for the future. in addition, decreases in fuel prices for an extended period may result in increased industry capacity, increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general. if fuel prices were subsequently to rise quickly, there may be a lag between improvement of revenue and the adverse impact of higher fuel prices.
to protect against increases in the market prices of fuel, the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements. however, the companys hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs, and any price protection provided may be limited due to choice of hedging instruments and market conditions, including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties. to the extent that the company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly, such hedge contracts may limit the companys ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future. if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the company enters into a hedge contract, the company may be required to post collateral (margin) beyond certain thresholds. there can be no assurance that the companys hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the companys hedging arrangements. additionally, deterioration in the companys financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future and may potentially require the company to post increased amounts of collateral under its fuel hedging agreements.
the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and regulations promulgated by the commodity futures trading commission (the cftc) require centralized clearing for over-the-counter derivatives and record-keeping and reporting requirements that are applicable to the companys fuel hedge contracts. the ual board of directors (board of directors) has approved the companys election of the cftcs end-user exception, which permits the company as a non-financial end user of derivatives to hedge commercial risk and be exempt from the cftc mandatory clearing requirements. however, several of the companys hedge counterparties are also subject to these requirements, which may raise the counterparties costs. those increased costs may in turn be passed on to the company, resulting in increased transaction costs to execute hedge contracts and lower credit thresholds to post collateral (margin).
see note 10 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on the companys hedging programs.
union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions, as well as the integration of uniteds workforces in connection with the companys merger transaction in 2010, could adversely affect the companys operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance.
united is a highly unionized company. as of december 31, 2015, the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 84,000 active employees, of whom approximately 80% were represented by various u.s. labor organizations.
the successful integration of uniteds workforces in connection with the companys merger transaction in 2010 and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combined company depend in part on integrating employee groups and maintaining productive employee relations. in order to fully integrate the companys pre-merger represented employee groups, the company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group. the process for integrating the labor groups is governed by a combination of the rla, the mccaskill-bond amendment, and where applicable, the existing provisions of collective bargaining agreements
15
and union policies. a delay in or failure to integrate employee groups presents the potential for increased operating costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect the companys operations.
the company has reached joint collective bargaining agreements with the majority of its employee groups since the merger transaction in 2010 with only two groups remaining without combined collective bargaining agreements. we continue to negotiate for a joint flight attendant collective bargaining agreement and its technician and related employees are in the process of submitting a recent company proposal for ratification by its membership. the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of these labor negotiations will be achieved.
there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the companys merger transaction in 2010. there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns, work-to-rule campaigns, sick-outs or other actions designed to disrupt the companys normal operations, in an attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations. although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to self-help, and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature self-help, such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined. in addition, joint collective bargaining agreements with the companys represented employee groups increase the companys labor costs, which increase could be material for any applicable reporting period.
see notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on labor negotiations and costs.
an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the companys business, financial position and results of operations.
an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand or travel behavior, or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat in the future, could have a material adverse impact on the companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
extensive government regulation could increase the companys operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business.
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight. compliance with u.s. and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company. laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges, both domestically and internationally, have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue.
united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot. if the dot altered, amended, modified, suspended or revoked these certificates, it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business. the faa regulates the safety of uniteds operations. united operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa. in january 2014, the faas more stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations took effect, which has increased costs for all carriers. in july 2014, minimum qualifications took effect for air carrier first officers. these regulations impact the company and its regional partner flying, as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots, while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire. although this is an industry issue, it directly affects the company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying, as several regional partners have experienced difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced pilot availability. from time to time, the faa also issues orders, airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company. these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design, manufacturing, maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action. faa requirements cover, among other things, retirement of older aircraft, collision avoidance
16
systems, airborne windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement and other environmental concerns, aircraft operation and safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft. these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company.
in addition, the companys operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated air traffic control (atc) system utilized by the u.s. government. during peak travel periods in certain markets, the current atc systems inability to handle atc demand has led to short-term capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic. in addition, the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth. imposition of these atc constraints on a long-term basis may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations. failure to update the atc system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations.
access to landing and take-off rights, or slots, at several major u.s. airports and many foreign airports served by the company are, or recently have been, subject to government regulation. certain of the companys major hubs are among the most congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights and/or increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day. the faa may limit the companys airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports, which could affect the companys ownership and transfer rights, and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to their facilities, which could have an adverse effect on the companys business. the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines slot holdings that airlines have challenged; if the faa were to take actions that adversely affect the companys slot holdings, the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots. further, the companys operating costs at airports, including the companys major hubs, may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund, directly or indirectly. such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the companys approval and may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition.
the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between the united states and other countries may be subject to change. applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time, government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised, and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change. the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements, regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes, the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes, the airports at which carriers may operate international flights, or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports. any further limitations, additions or modifications to such arrangements, regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and results of operations. additionally, a change in law, regulation or policy for any of the companys international routes, such as open skies, could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets. in addition, competition from revenue-sharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the companys business and assets on the open skies routes. the companys plans to enter into or expand u.s. antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable u.s. federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements. there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied.
many aspects of the companys operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws protecting the environment. future environmental regulatory developments, such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry. there are certain climate change laws and regulations that have already gone into effect
17
and that apply to the company, including the european unions emissions trading scheme, the state of californias ghg cap and trade regulations, environmental taxes for certain international flights, limited ghg reporting requirements and land-use planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances. in addition, there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of ghgs by the aviation industry. the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict, but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant.
in 2016, the u.s. congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the faa, which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy related issues. as with previous reauthorization legislation, the u.s. congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact the companys operations and costs.
see part i, item 1, businessindustry regulation, of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company.
the airline industry may undergo further change with respect to alliances and joint ventures, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company.
the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to the modification of alliances and formation of new joint ventures. carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances, slot swaps and/or joint ventures. certain types of airline joint ventures further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes, pool revenues and costs, and enjoy other mutual benefits, achieving many of the benefits of consolidation. open skies agreements, including the agreements between the united states and the european union and between the united states and japan, may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers. movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for joint ventures and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment. there is ongoing speculation that further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future, especially if new open skies agreements between brazil and the united states and mexico and the united states are fully implemented. the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position, including current and potential alliances, asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities. if other airlines participate in such activities, those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities, thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the companys ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships.
inadequate liquidity or a negative impact on the companys liquidity from factors beyond the companys control may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and business.
the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations, including aircraft lease and debt financings, leases of airport property and other facilities, and other material cash obligations. in addition, the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines.
although the companys cash flows from operations and its available capital, including the proceeds from financing transactions, have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date, the companys future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this item 1a., including, but not limited to, substantial volatility in the price of fuel, adverse economic conditions, disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events.
if the companys liquidity is constrained due to the various risk factors noted in this item 1a. or otherwise, the company might not be able to timely pay its debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations. these covenants require the company or united, as applicable, to maintain minimum liquidity and/
18
or minimum collateral coverage ratios, depending on the particular agreement. the companys ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, including the overall industry revenue environment, the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of certain collateral.
if the company does not timely pay its debts or comply with such covenants, a variety of adverse consequences could result. these potential adverse consequences include an increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements, withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers, loss of undrawn lines of credit, the occurrence of one or more events of default under the relevant agreements, the acceleration of the maturity of debt and/or the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and results of operations. the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such debt if it were accelerated. in addition, an event of default or acceleration of debt under certain of its financing agreements could result in one or more events of default under certain of the companys other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions.
furthermore, constrained liquidity may limit the companys ability to withstand competitive pressures and downturns in the travel business and the economy in general.
the companys substantial level of indebtedness and non-investment grade credit rating, as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms, or at all.
see part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, of this report for additional information regarding the companys liquidity.
increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the companys results of operations and financial condition.
the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event, including aircraft accidents. if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance (including but not limited to aviation hull and liability insurance, workers compensation, and property and business interruption coverage) to cover such liabilities or losses, whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
following the terrorist attacks on september 11, 2001, the companys insurance costs increased significantly and the availability of third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance decreased significantly. from september 2001 through may 2014, the company obtained third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance through a faa-administered program. in anticipation of the government discontinuing this program, effective may 2014, the company terminated its faa-administered insurance and returned to the commercial insurance markets to obtain third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance. the government subsequently discontinued the faa-administered program in december 2014. if the company is unable in the future to obtain third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance with acceptable terms, or if the coverage obtained is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the company experiences, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
the companys results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry.
due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year, which are periods of lower travel demand. the companys results of operations generally reflect this seasonality, but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including, among others, the imposition of excise and similar taxes, extreme or severe weather, atc control congestion, geological events, natural disasters, changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation,
19
general economic conditions and other factors. as a result, the companys quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its long-lived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations.
in accordance with applicable accounting standards, the company is required to test its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 of each year, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. in addition, the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
the company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to, among other factors, extreme fuel price volatility, tight credit markets, a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets, unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment, as well as other uncertainties. the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period. the value of the companys aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers. an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and results of operations.
the companys ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for u.s. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.
as of december 31, 2015, ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss (nol) carryforwards of approximately $8.0 billion.
the companys ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an ownership change as defined in section 382 (section 382) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporations stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change.
there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards. potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock, including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of any convertible debt that ual may issue in the future, the repurchase of such debt with ual common stock, any issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5% or more of ual common stock, or a combination of such transactions, may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382.
under section 382, a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of pre-ownership change nols that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporations stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. any unused annual limitation may, subject to certain limits, be carried over to later years, and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by built-in gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change. this limitation could cause the companys u.s. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause all or a portion of the companys nol carryforwards to expire unused. similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. the companys ability to use its nol
20
carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full.
uals amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits certain transfers of its stock, which limits are intended to preserve our ability to use our nol carryforwards, and these limits could have an effect on the market price of ual common stock.
to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the companys ability to use its nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes, uals amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a 5% ownership limitation. this limitation generally remains effective until february 1, 2017, or until such later date as may be approved by the board of directors in its sole discretion. the limitation prohibits (i) an acquisition by a single stockholder of shares that results in that stockholder owning 5% or more of ual common stock and (ii) any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns 5% or more of ual common stock, unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors.
any transfer of common stock in violation of these restrictions will be void and will be treated as if such transfer never occurred. this provision of uals amended and restated certificate of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell ual common stock. in addition, this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company, creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial, which could also adversely affect the market price of the ual common stock. the company cannot predict the effect that this provision in uals amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the ual common stock. for additional information regarding the 5% ownership limitation, please refer to uals amended and restated certificate of incorporation available on the investor relations section of the companys website at http://ir.united.com.

(together with its consolidated subsidiaries, ual or the company) is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is united airlines, inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, united). as ual consolidates united for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of united also apply to ual, unless otherwise noted. uniteds operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of uals revenues and operating expenses. in addition, united comprises approximately the entire balance of uals assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. when appropriate, ual and united are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of ual and united are separately disclosed and explained. we sometimes use the words we, our, us, and the company in this report for disclosures that relate to all of ual and united.
2015 financial highlights
                                                 2015 net income was $7.3 billion, or $19.47 diluted earnings per share, which reflects $3.1 billion of income tax benefits primarily due to the release of the income tax valuation allowance. non-gaap net income was $4.5 billion for 2015, or $11.88 diluted earnings per share, which excludes $2.6 billion of special items and reflects $249 million of hedge program adjustments. see part ii, item 6
of this report for a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap net income.

   uniteds consolidated prasm decreased 4.4% in 2015 compared to 2014.

   aircraft fuel cost decreased 36% year-over-year due mainly to lower fuel prices.

   2015 consolidated casm, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, decreased 0.7% year-over-year on a consolidated capacity increase of 1.6%. 2015 casm, including those items, decreased 11.9% year-over-year.

                                           the company used $1.2 billion of cash to purchase 21 million shares of its common stock during 2015 under its share repurchase programs. as of december 31, 2015, the company has $2.4 billion remaining to spend under the 2015 program. see part ii, item 5, market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities
of this report for additional information.

   ual ended the year with $6.5 billion in unrestricted liquidity, which consisted of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and available capacity under the revolving credit facility of the companys credit agreement.

                                                                                                                                                                     ual, united and mileage plus holdings, llc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ual and united, entered into a second amended and restated co-branded card marketing services agreement (the co-brand agreement) with chase bank usa, n.a. (chase), pursuant to which members of the companys mileageplus® loyalty program earn frequent flyer miles for making purchases using a mileageplus® credit card issued by chase. the co-brand agreement also provides for joint marketing and other support for the mileageplus® credit card. this increased 2015 operating revenues by approximately $200 million from the combined impact of the co-brand agreement, agreements ancillary to the co-brand agreement and updated accounting assumptions for accounting purposes.

2015 operational highlights
   consolidated rpms for 2015 increased 1.5% as compared to 2014, and consolidated asms increased 1.6% from the prior year, resulting in a consolidated load factor of 83.4% in 2015.

   for 2015 and 2014, the company recorded a dot on-time arrival rate of 78.1% and 76.0%, respectively, and a system completion factor of 98.7% and 98.6%, respectively.

                                                        the company took delivery of 11 new boeing 787-9 dreamliners in 2015, bringing its total dreamliner fleet to 25 aircraft. the company also took delivery of 23 new boeing 737-900ers, 11 new embraer e175s and four used boeing 737-700 aircraft in 2015. united exited from scheduled service 13 boeing 757-200s, 46 embraer erj 145s and one boeing 747-400. the company also exited one boeing 747-400
operating exclusively in charter service.

                                                      effective march 1, 2015, the company modified its mileageplus program for most tickets from the prior model in which members earn redeemable miles based on distance traveled to the current model, which is based on ticket price (including base fare and carrier imposed surcharges). members are now able to earn between five and eleven miles per dollar spent based on their mileageplus status. the modified program enhances the rewards for customers who spend more with united and gives them improved mileage-earning opportunities.

2016 outlook set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results and/or from our anticipated results of operations described in the forward-looking statements in this report. see item 1a., risk factors, of this report and the factors described under forward-looking information below for additional discussion of these and other factors that could affect us.
the company is committed to improving the efficiency and quality of all aspects of its business in 2016. key initiatives for the year include improving our operational reliability and the handling of customers during irregular operations, such as adverse weather, refurbishing aircraft interiors, investing in our airports and taking delivery of more than 30 new, highly-efficient and customer-pleasing aircraft.
economic conditions. the economic outlook for the aviation industry in 2016 is characterized by expected slow or modest u.s. and global economic growth. in such conditions, we expect a modest increase in the demand for air travel. continuing economic uncertainty, along with the strengthening u.s. dollar, is providing uncertainty in key asian and european markets, and along with continued political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the middle east, may result in diminished demand for air travel. the global economy is also being impacted by declining oil prices, putting pressure on certain geographic markets.
capacity. over the past three years, the company leveraged the flexibility of its fleet to better match capacity with market demand. in 2016, the company expects consolidated asms to grow between 1.5% and 2.5% year-over-year.
fuel. the companys average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was $1.94 in 2015 as compared to $2.99 in 2014. since 2014, the price of jet fuel has declined and remains volatile. based on projected fuel consumption in 2016, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the companys annual fuel expense by approximately $94 million. to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel, the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements.
labor. as of december 31, 2015, united had approximately 80% of employees represented by unions. we are in the process of negotiating joint collective bargaining agreements with our technicians and flight attendants and negotiating extensions to the iam represented employees agreements. the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups, although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have a material financial impact on the company. the cost associated with the ratification of the pilots agreement will add an additional approximate 1.5 points of non-fuel unit cost in both the first-quarter and full-year 2016 versus 2015.
casm. in 2016, the company expects casm, excluding fuel, third-party business expense, profit sharing, special charges and the impact of the recently ratified pilot agreement to be up between 0.5% and 1.5% year-over-year. we are unable to project casm on a gaap basis as the nature and amount of special charges are not determinable at this time.
32
the companys cost initiative project that began in 2014 has a goal to reduce the companys annual costs by $2 billion and generate an incremental $700 million in additional ancillary revenue by the end of 2017. the anticipated savings are comprised of $1 billion in annual fuel savings, based on fuel prices in 2013, and $1 billion of non-fuel savings. in 2015, the company achieved approximately $555 million in fuel savings and $851 million in non-fuel savings.
income taxes. the company anticipates its effective tax rate will be approximately 37%, which reflects a more normalized rate after the release of the tax valuation allowance in 2015 and is based on the companys relative mix of domestic, foreign and state income tax expense.
results of operations in this section, we compare results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 with results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014, and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 with results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2013. non-gaap financial measures are presented because they provide management and investors with the ability to measure and monitor the companys performance on a consistent basis.

consolidated passenger revenue in 2015 decreased $977 million, or 2.9%, as compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in consolidated yield of 4.3% year-over-year. yields were impacted by a competitive domestic fare environment, unfavorable foreign currency results due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, international surcharge declines, travel reductions from corporate customers in the energy sector and increased industry capacity in certain regions. the decline in yields was partially offset by a 1.5% year-over-year increase in traffic.

salaries and related costs increased $778 million, or 8.7%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a $463 million increase in profit sharing costs as a result of improved profitability, higher pay rates driven by new collective bargaining agreements, an increase in medical and dental costs and an increase in pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions.
the decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices partially offset by losses from fuel hedging activity and a 1.6% increase in capacity. the table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):

depreciation and amortization increased $140 million, or 8.3%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to additions in owned property and equipment, specifically related to new aircraft, information technology assets and several aircraft capital lease conversions from operating leases.
34
aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased $128 million, or 7.2%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a year-over-year decrease in significant airframe maintenance visits as a result of the cyclical timing of these visits, improvements in the efficiency of in-house maintenance programs, a reduced volume of seat and landing gear maintenance and a reduction of flying hours under certain power-by-the-hour engine maintenance agreements, partially offset by increases in expenses related to aircraft reliability projects and wi-fi systems maintenance.
aircraft rent decreased $129 million or 14.6% in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lease expirations, the purchase or capital lease conversion of several operating leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft.

the decrease in interest expense of $66 million, or 9.0%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the prepayment of certain debt issuances and declining balances of other debt, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued for the acquisition of new aircraft.
miscellaneous, net included losses of $80 million and $462 million from fuel derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting in 2015 and 2014, respectively. foreign currency losses were approximately $129 million and $41 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. foreign currency results included $61 million and $10 million of foreign exchange losses for 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the companys cash holdings in venezuela. miscellaneous, net for 2015 includes a $134 million special charge related to the write-off of unamortized non-cash debt discounts for the early redemption of the 6% notes due 2026 (2026 notes) and the 6% notes due 2028 (2028 notes). 2014 miscellaneous, net includes a $64 million debt extinguishment charge related to the retirement of the $248 million 6% convertible junior subordinated debentures due 2030.

(a) see part ii, item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics.
consolidated passenger revenue in 2014 increased $640 million, or 1.9%, as compared to 2013. this increase was primarily due to an increase in consolidated yield of 1.7% and an increase in average fare per passenger of 2.8%. there was also an increase in capacity and traffic of 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, as compared to 2013. the 2014 average fare increase was due in part to a strong domestic demand environment and a number of new long-haul routes that generated higher fares than the system average. also in 2014, the company improved its revenue management demand forecast process related to close-in bookings which improved yields. 2013 consolidated passenger revenue was negatively impacted by factors including additional competitive capacity in china and the japanese yen weakening against the u.s. dollar, resulting in lower pacific yields.
cargo revenue increased by $56 million, or 6.3%, in 2014 as compared to 2013, which was primarily due to higher freight volumes and an improvement in mail revenue year-over-year, partially offset by lower yield on freight.
other operating revenue decreased $74 million, or 1.7%, in 2014 as compared to 2013, which was primarily due to the companys decision to discontinue sales of aircraft fuel to a third party, partially offset by increases in ancillary, mileageplus and contract services revenue.

salaries and related costs increased $310 million, or 3.6%, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher pay rates driven by collective bargaining agreements, increased medical and dental costs and costs associated with crew shortages and new crew rest rules, partially offset by lower post-employment benefit costs.
landing fees and other rent increased $184 million, or 8.8%, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to a transition from paying regional carriers for landing fees to paying airports directly. landing fees also increased due to airport security services and modernization projects at certain airport locations.
aircraft rent decreased $53 million, or 5.7%, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to aircraft lease expirations and terminations of several boeing 757-200 aircraft leases resulting from the companys purchase of the leased aircraft.

the decrease in interest expense of $48 million, or 6.1%, in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the companys extinguishment of certain of its debt instruments and the refinancing of certain of its debt instruments at lower interest rates.
in 2014, miscellaneous, net included a mtm loss of $462 million from fuel derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting as compared to a gain of $79 million in 2013. miscellaneous, net also included foreign currency losses of $41 million and $29 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. 2014 miscellaneous, net includes a $64 million debt extinguishment charge related to the retirement of the $248 million 6% convertible junior subordinated debentures due 2030.
uniteds nonoperating expense also included a net gain of $19 million associated with marking to market the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities related to agreements that provide for uniteds convertible debt to be settled with ual common stock as compared to a net gain of $70 million in 2013. these net gains and related derivatives are reflected only in the united stand-alone financial statements as they are eliminated at the consolidated level. see note 9 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2015, the company had $5.2 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, an increase of $0.8 billion from december 31, 2014. the company had its entire commitment capacity of $1.35 billion under the credit agreement available for letters of credit or borrowings as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, the company had $206 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, which is primarily collateral for performance bonds, letters of credit and estimated future workers compensation claims. we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to provide security for obligations. restricted cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2014 totaled $320 million.
38
as is the case with many of our principal competitors, we have a high proportion of debt compared to capital. we have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations. at december 31, 2015, the company had approximately $11.8 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $1.4 billion that are due within the next 12 months. in addition, we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. as of december 31, 2015, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $4.6 billion. however, approximately $5.9 billion of our current liabilities are related to our advance ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue, both of which largely represent revenue to be recognized for travel in the near future and not actual cash outlays. the deficit in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows, liquidity or operations. the company made principal payments of debt and capital lease obligations totaling $2.3 billion in 2015.
the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to prepay its debt, including open market repurchases, to reduce its indebtedness and related interest.
for 2016, the company expects between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion of gross capital expenditures. see notes 11 and 15 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on commitments.
as of december 31, 2015, a substantial portion of the companys assets, principally aircraft, route authorities and loyalty program intangible assets, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. see note 11 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the company.
although access to the capital markets improved in recent years as evidenced by our financing transactions, we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. we must sustain our profitability and/or access the capital markets to meet our significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines.
the following is a discussion of the companys sources and uses of cash from 2013 through 2015.
cash flows from operating activities
2015 compared to 2014
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $6.0 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the same period in 2014. the $3.4 billion increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $3.1 billion in income before income taxes and a $0.4 billion increase in non-cash items for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by $0.1 billion year-over-year in 2015 as compared to 2014. the following were significant working capital items in 2015: cash flow increased by $0.2 billion from the return of hedge collateral net of the impact of changes in fuel derivative positions. cash flow from other liabilities, including accrued wages, decreased $0.2 billion, which included $0.8 billion in pension contributions offset by $0.7 billion in profit sharing accruals to be paid in 2016. frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles decreased $0.2 billion.
2014 compared to 2013
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $2.6 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the same period in 2013. the $1.2 billion increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $0.6 billion in income before income taxes and $0.6 billion of changes in working capital items year-over-year in 2014 as compared to 2013. the following were significant working capital items in 2014: cash flow from advance ticket sales increased by $0.3 billion. accounts receivable decreased by $0.2 billion mainly due to the timing of settlements with airline partners for interline billing. cash flow from other liabilities, including accrued
39
wages, decreased $0.2 billion, which included $0.5 billion in pension contributions offset by $0.2 billion in profit sharing accruals. in 2014, cash flow decreased by $0.1 billion from the posting of fuel hedge collateral, net of changes in fuel derivative positions. accounts payable decreased by $0.3 billion primarily due to the timing of settlements with airline partners for interline billing along with changes in various accruals.
cash flows from investing activities
2015 compared to 2014
the companys capital expenditures were $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the companys capital expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, facility and fleet-related costs. in 2015, the company announced a strategic partnership with azul linhas aereas brasileiras s.a. (azul). through a wholly-owned subsidiary, the company invested $100 million for an economic stake of approximately five percent in azul, brazils largest carrier by cities served, which provides a range of customer benefits including codesharing of flights, joint loyalty program participation and expanded connection opportunities on routes between the u.s. and brazil, a key market for united, in addition to other points in north and south america.
2014 compared to 2013
the companys capital expenditures were $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the companys capital expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, facility and fleet-related costs.

contractual obligations. the companys business is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. in the past, the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. the company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.

(a)                                            long-term debt presented in the companys financial statements is net of $145 million of debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs which are being amortized over the debt terms. contractual payments are not net of the debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs. contractual long-term debt includes $20 million of non-cash obligations as these debt payments are made directly to the creditor by a company that leases one aircraft from united. the creditors only recourse to united is repossession of the aircraft.

(b)   includes interest portion of capital lease obligations of $71 million in 2016, $55 million in 2017, $45 million in 2018, $39 million in 2019, $37 million in 2020 and
$309 million thereafter. future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve.

(c)                                           represents our estimates of future minimum noncancelable commitments under our cpas and does not include the portion of the underlying obligations for aircraft and facility rent that is disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. amounts also exclude a portion of uniteds capital lease obligation recorded for certain of its cpas. see note 13 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for the significant assumptions used to estimate the payments.

(d)   amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2025. benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded.

(e)                               represents estimate of the minimum funding requirements as determined by government regulations for uniteds material pension plans. amounts are subject to change based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of assets in the plan and bond rates. see critical accounting policies, below, for a discussion of our current year assumptions regarding uniteds pension plans.

(f)                                           represents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft and spare engines only and noncancelable commitments to purchase goods and services, primarily information technology support. in january 2016, ual entered into a purchase agreement amendment with boeing for a firm narrowbody aircraft order of 40 boeing 737ng aircraft and the table above is adjusted to include that impact. see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for a discussion of our purchase commitments.

off-balance sheet arrangements. an off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements. the companys primary off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in contractual obligations, above, and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below.
as of december 31, 2015, united had cash collateralized $70 million of letters of credit. united also had $437 million of performance bonds relating to various real estate, customs and aircraft financing obligations at december 31, 2015. most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the performance bonds have expiration dates through 2019.
as of december 31, 2015, united is the guarantor of approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. these bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing
43
bodies. the leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases. the leasing arrangements associated with a portion of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases. the annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above.
eetcs. in november 2015 and august 2014, united completed two separate eetc offerings for a total principal amount of $1.5 billion. united has received and recorded all of the proceeds from these offerings as debt as of december 31, 2015. see notes 11 and 14 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on eetc pass-through trusts and variable interest entity consideration.
increased cost provisions. see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the companys debt.
fuel consortia. united participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. the consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. in general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. as of december 31, 2015, approximately $1.3 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates, as to which united and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt. as of december 31, 2015, the companys contingent exposure was approximately $224 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. the companys contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases. the guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2017 to 2041. the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made. see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information related to the companys fuel consortia.
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with gaap, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements.
revenue recognition. the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage. the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines. differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate. when necessary, the company records a reserve against our interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different. non-refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date.
fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred. the fare on the changed ticket, including any additional collection of fare, is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided. change fees related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the companys additional service to modify a previous sale. therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes.
44
the company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused. these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends. refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance.
in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) amended the fasb accounting standards codification and created a new topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers. this amendment prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the amendment supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in topic 605, revenue recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the codification. the amendment will become effective for the companys annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. under the new standard, certain airline ancillary fees directly related to passenger revenue tickets, such as airline change fees and baggage fees, are likely to no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the passenger travel component. in addition, the change fees which were previously recognized when received, will likely be recognized when transportation is provided. the company is evaluating other impacts on its consolidated financial statements.
frequent flyer accounting. the companys mileageplus program is designed to increase customer loyalty. program participants earn miles by flying on united and certain other participating airlines. program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in the companys loyalty program. we sell miles to these partners, which include credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels, car rental companies and our participating airline partners. miles can be redeemed for free (other than taxes and government imposed fees), discounted or upgraded air travel and non-travel awards. the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model.
in the case of the sale of air services, the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement. the miles are recorded in frequent flyer deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheet and recognized into revenue when the transportation is provided.
the company determines the estimated selling price of air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis. the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis.
the companys estimated selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount, which incorporates the expected redemption of miles, as the best estimate of selling price for these miles. the equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12 months weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern, cabin class, loyalty status and geographic region. the estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by a fulfillment discount that considers a number of factors, including redemption patterns of various customer groups.
united has a significant contract to sell mileageplus miles to its co-branded credit card partner, chase. united identified the following significant revenue elements in the co-brand agreement: the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile (generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above); use of the united brand and access to mileageplus member lists; advertising; and other travel related benefits.
the fair value of the elements is determined using managements estimated selling price of each element. the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, volume discounts, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the co-brand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered. we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis, which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis.

the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered. the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned.
the company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members, which we refer to as breakage. the company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns. miles expire after 18 months of member account inactivity. the companys estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs.
the following table summarizes information related to the companys frequent flyer deferred revenue liability:

impact of 1% change in outstanding miles or weighted average ticket value on deferred revenue (in millions)         $60
effective march 1, 2015, the company modified its mileageplus program for most tickets from a model in which members earned redeemable miles based on distance traveled to one based on ticket price (including base fare and carrier imposed surcharges). members now earn between five and eleven miles per dollar spent based on their mileageplus status. the updated program enhances the rewards for customers who spend more with united and gives them improved mileage-earning opportunities. this modification had no material impact to the frequent flyer deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheet.
long-lived assets. the net book value of operating property and equipment for the company was $22 billion and $19 billion at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. the assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges.
the company records assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost. depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. as aircraft technology has improved, useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years. residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the companys fleet plan and other relevant information. a one-year increase in the average depreciable life of the companys flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately $50 million.
the company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. for purposes of this testing, the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment. an impairment charge is recognized when the assets carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. the amount of the charge is the difference between the assets carrying value and fair market value.
defined benefit plan accounting. we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets.
uniteds pension plans under-funded status was $1.5 billion at december 31, 2015. funding requirements for tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. in 2016, we anticipate contributing at least $400 million to our pension plans. the fair value of the plans assets was $3.0 billion at december 31, 2015.
46
when calculating pension expense for 2016, the company assumed that its plans assets would generate a long-term rate of return of approximately 7.0%. the expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. our projected long-term rate of return reflects the active management of our plans assets. the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.
the defined benefit pension plans assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts. return generating investments include primarily equity securities, fixed-income securities and alternative investments (e.g. private equity and hedge funds). risk mitigating investments include primarily u.s. government and investment grade corporate fixed-income securities. the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31, 2015:
percent of total      expected long-term rate of return equity securities                        38 %                   9.5 %
fixed-income securities                    37                     5.0
alternatives                               18                     7.3
other                                       7                     7.0
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points (from 7.0% to 6.5%) would increase estimated 2016 pension expense by approximately $15 million.
future pension obligations for uniteds plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 4.58% at december 31, 2015. the company selected the discount rate for substantially all of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31, 2015 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments.
the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points (from 4.58% to 4.08%) would increase the pension liability at december 31, 2015 by approximately $477 million and increase the estimated 2016 pension expense by approximately $55 million.
future changes in plan asset returns, plan provisions, assumed discount rates, pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.
actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans, those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees. all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of $844 million and $982 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
other postretirement benefit plan accounting. uniteds postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits, primarily in the united states, to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as certain life insurance
47
benefits to certain retirees reflected as other benefits. united also has retiree medical programs that permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility. eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits, which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement. plan benefits are subject to co-payments, deductibles, and other limits as described in the plans.
the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plans funded status, in its financial statements. other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. united has not been required to pre-fund its plan obligations, which has resulted in a significant net obligation, as discussed below. the companys benefit obligation was $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. the company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. the companys weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31, 2015 was 4.49%, as compared to 4.07% for december 31, 2014. the health care cost trend rate assumed for 2015 was 7.00%, declining to 5.0% in 2023, as compared to assumed trend rate for 2016 of 6.75%, declining to 5.0% in 2023. a 1% increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the companys total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31, 2015 by $13 million; whereas, a 1% decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the companys total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31, 2015 by $11 million. a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the companys postretirement benefit liability by approximately $227 million and increase the estimated 2015 benefits expense by approximately $12 million.
actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans. under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans, actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the company had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of $236 million and $233 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
income taxes. the companys income tax benefit was $3.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. a discrete tax benefit of $3.1 billion for the reduction to the u.s. net federal and state deferred tax asset valuation allowance was included in the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2015.
during 2015, after considering all positive and negative evidence and the four sources of taxable income, the company concluded that its deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. in evaluating the likelihood of utilizing the companys net federal and state deferred tax assets, the significant relevant factors that the company considered are: (1) its recent history and forecasted profitability; (2) growth in the u.s. and global economies; and (3) future impact of taxable temporary differences. although the company was not in a three-year cumulative loss position at december 31, 2014, management concluded that the low level of cumulative pre-tax income, coupled with the companys history of operating losses resulted in a determination that a valuation allowance was still necessary. we considered past profitability and future expectations of profitability to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets. management placed significant weight on past performance (i.e., losses or near break-even results in 2009 to 2013) as it is more objectively verifiable than projections of future taxable income. however, during 2015, the companys pre-tax profit of $4.2 billion benefited from lower oil prices and improved efficiency that resulted in significant taxable income. additionally, based upon current projection of future
48
earnings, the company evaluated the nols expiration periods and change in ownership limitations under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, and determined the nols would be realized before expiring beginning in 2025. therefore, the company released almost all of its valuation allowance in 2015, resulting in a $3.1 billion benefit in its provision for income taxes. the valuation allowance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci) in prior years was released through the income statement and resulted in remaining debits within aoci of $285 million and $180 million related to pension and derivatives, respectively, which will not be recognized into income tax expense until either the plans are exited or the company no longer has any outstanding derivatives.
the company has retained a valuation allowance of $48 million against certain state and local nols and credit carryforwards at the end of 2015. the company expects these nols and credits will expire unused due to limited carryforward periods. the ability to utilize these state nols and credits will be evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if there are any significant events or any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would affect the companys ability to realize these deferred tax assets.
the company has a net deferred tax asset totaling $2.0 billion as of december 31, 2015 that relates primarily to its federal and state nol carryforwards. the federal and state nol carryforwards relate to prior years nols, which may be used to reduce tax liabilities in future years. these tax benefits are mostly attributable to federal pre-tax nol carryforwards of $8.0 billion for ual. if not utilized, these federal pre-tax nols will expire as follows (in billions): $2.1 in 2025, $2.0 in 2026, $1.4 in 2027 and $2.5 after 2028. in addition, the majority of tax benefits of the state net operating losses of $103 million for ual will expire over a five to 20-year period. additionally, the company has $232 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards which do not expire.

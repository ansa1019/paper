issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall and/or result in harm to the company's reputation, negatively impacting our operating results.
in order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers. issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company's image and reputation. negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption. in addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages. costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results.
increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results.
we use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, corn sweeteners, natural gas and fuel oil.
commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including:
   commodity market fluctuations;
   currency exchange rates;
   imbalances between supply and demand;
   the effect of weather on crop yield;
   speculative influences;
   trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;
   supplier compliance with commitments;
   political unrest in producing countries; and
   changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.
although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs. if
6
we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity.
we may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption. if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
market demand for new and existing products could decline.
we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. to generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers. our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:
   effective retail execution;
   appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;
   our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;
   our ability to drive innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories;
   changes in product category consumption;
   our response to consumer demographics and trends, including trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing e-commerce channel; and
   consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.
there continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively. our largest customer, mclane company, inc., accounted for approximately 26% of our total net sales in 2015. mclane company, inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including wal-mart stores, inc.
increased marketplace competition could hurt our business.
the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues. some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations. we continue to experience increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which pressured confectionery category growth. in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products. due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. in addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment.
disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.
approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states. disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following:
7
   natural disaster;
   pandemic outbreak of disease;
   weather;
   fire or explosion;
   terrorism or other acts of violence;
   labor strikes or other labor activities;
   unavailability of raw or packaging materials; and
   operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers.
we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions. we have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy. if we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.
our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.
from time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives. the success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval. these activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management's attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. if the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
during 2015, we faced a number of challenges in connection with the ongoing integration of sgm. since its acquisition in 2014, the sgm business has performed below expectations, with net sales and earnings well below pre-acquisition levels. in addition, issues with the quality of sgm's accounts receivables and existing distributor networks have affected our ability to fully realize many of the acquisition benefits that we believe will help accelerate our growth in china and enhance our ability to serve chinese consumers. as a result of sgm's poor performance and these other contributing factors, in the second and third quarters of 2015 we recorded a goodwill write-down of approximately $266 million, representing all of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit. while we believe we have appropriate strategies in place that will allow us to accelerate the sgm integration in 2016, additional challenges that impede further integration could jeopardize our growth strategy in china and could have a negative impact on the results of operations and cash flows of our international and other reportable segment.
changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products.
changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment. these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws and environmental laws, among others. it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
political, economic and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results.
our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. volatility in food and energy costs, sustained
8
global recessions, rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.
changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company, our customers and our suppliers. a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.
our expanding international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations.
in 2015, we derived approximately 17% of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states, versus 19% in 2014 and 18% in 2013. additionally, approximately 32% of our total long-lived assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31, 2015. as part of our global growth strategy, we have made investments outside of the united states, particularly china and asia, mexico and brazil. as a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:
   unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand;
   inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;
   difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;
   unexpected changes in regulatory environments;
   political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;
   nationalization of our properties by foreign governments;
   tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;
   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;
   the imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
   increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;
   the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies;
   failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; and
   failure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce.
if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.
information technology is critically important to our business operations. we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions. these processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others.
we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company's data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack. our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings. additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.
9
we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness. we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology.
while we believe that our security technology and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our company, our employees, and those with whom we do business.
we might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies.
our people continue to be our most important asset, and our future success depends upon our ability to identify, hire, develop, engage and retain talented personnel across the globe. competition for global talent is intense, and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business. in particular, if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill the new senior management positions created as a result of the productivity initiative we announced in june 2015, our business performance may be impacted.
activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. we may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments.
in addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets, channels and categories. this may require significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. if we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is intended to provide an understanding of hershey's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. the md&a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly in item 1a. "risk factors."
the md&a is organized in the following sections:
•   overview and outlook
•   non-gaap information
•   consolidated results of operations
•   segment results
•   financial condition
•   critical accounting policies and estimates overview and outlook we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. we market, sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide. we report our operations through two segments: north america and international and other.
we continued to make progress against our strategic initiatives in 2015, including margin expansion in our north america segment which fuels our earnings per share and enables us to make investments in other parts of the business, a demonstrated commitment to transparency and simple ingredients to satisfy evolving consumer preferences, additional investments in our snacks business, and a continued focus on insights and knowledge to identify and respond to changing consumer and retail trends and practices.
our 2015 financial performance was impacted by a continued slow-down in u.s. retail take-away, an increase in competitive activity and poor performance in china. for the full year 2015, our u.s. cmg retail takeaway increased 2.4%, which was largely in line with the category growth rate but continues to be down from long-term historical average of 3-4%. we believe the category is being impacted by changing consumer shopping habits like channel shifting and e-commerce, increased competitive activity and higher levels of merchandising and display, and a proliferation of broader snacking options in the marketplace, which appears to be adversely impacting purchases of non-seasonal candy products.
our shanghai golden monkey ("sgm") business has performed below expectations since its initial acquisition in 2014, with net sales and earnings levels well below pre-acquisition levels. in addition, as part of our ongoing integration process, we assessed the quality of sgm's accounts receivable and existing distributor networks. based on the declining performance levels and the results of our integration assessments, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of july 5, 2015, which resulted in a preliminary $249.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, representing a write-down of all of the goodwill related to the sgm reporting unit as of july 5, 2015. during the third quarter, we updated our estimates of the acquisition-date fair values of the net assets acquired, which increased the value of acquired goodwill by $16.6 million. we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit, which resulted in a write-off of this additional goodwill, for a total impairment of $266.4 million. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with the selling sgm shareholders to reduce the originally-agreed purchase price for the remaining 20% of sgm, and we completed the purchase on february 3, 2016. we are directing our efforts currently on developing an integration plan that is focused on the optimal structure for top-line growth.
macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer shopping behavior adversely impacted our china chocolate business during 2015. the china chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical compound annual growth rate of 11-12% as marketplace trends continue to slow across all channels. as a result of the declining
16
performance in our china chocolate business, during the third quarter we also wrote-off $14.4 million of goodwill that resulted from the sgm acquisition and was assigned to our existing china chocolate business, as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkey-branded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks. in light of the declining results in our china business and challenges impacting the overall retail landscape in asia, we will continue to assess the impact of potential excess capacity on the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the asia region.
in june, we announced a new productivity initiative intended to simplify the organizational structure to enhance our ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer. in 2015, we incurred charges totaling $105.8 million, representing employee severance and related separation benefits, pension settlement charges, and incremental third-party costs related to the design and implementation of the new organizational structure. excluding pension settlement charges, we currently estimate total pre-tax charges and costs for the program to be approximately $120 million, the majority of which are cash. the remaining costs for this program are expected to be incurred within the first three quarters of 2016.
giving consideration to the aforementioned impacts, our 2015 net sales decreased 0.5%, to $7,386.6 million in 2015 from $7,421.8 million in 2014, while our net income and earnings per share-diluted declined by 39.4% and 38.5%, respectively. excluding a 1.6% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates, our net sales increased 1.1%. on a non-gaap basis, our net income increased by 1.5%, driven by positive u.s. gross margin expansion, while our non-gaap eps also benefited from recent share buybacks, increasing a total of 3.5%.
entering 2016, we expect changing shopping habits in the u.s. and volatile international markets to remain a headwind. despite these issues, we will continue to invest in our core brands in the u.s. and key international markets and build on the strategies we have established as they will benefit the company over the long term. we also plan to make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform to drive additional growth. these initiatives should enable us to achieve net sales and earnings growth. we expect to achieve long-term net sales growth of 3-5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and, given the scale advantages of our north america business and a balanced approach to international investments, we expect to generate long-term non-gaap earnings per share-diluted growth of 6-8%.
for 2016, we expect net sales growth of approximately 3%, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which is estimated to be approximately 1.0% unfavorable. north america net sales are expected to be driven by confectionery and snacks growth, including krave meat snacks distribution gains. we have many exciting new products that will bring variety, news and excitement to the category, including reese's snack mix and hershey's snack bites canisters, cadbury chocolates in a stand-up pouch targeting the mass premium market and the introduction of allan candy sugar confectionery peg bag items and some other yet to be announced new candy and snacking products. we expect gross margin to approximate the 2015 level and are focused on managing non-essential selling, marketing and administrative as we continue to leverage existing resources. additionally, implementation of the business productivity initiative announced in june is on track, and we will continue to invest in advertising and related consumer marketing, including a greater shift to digital and mobile communication. as a result, we expect 2016 full-year reported earnings per share-diluted to improve significantly, on the basis of lower unusual charges, and adjusted earnings per share-diluted to increase approximately 6%, as reflected in the reconciliation of reported to adjusted projections for 2016 that follows.
our 2016 outlook reflects information currently available to us; however, it is subject to risks and uncertainties, particularly pertaining to the macroeconomic uncertainties and evolving consumer dynamics in china. while further volatility could evolve in that market, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated cash flows or financial position.
17
non-gaap information the comparability of certain of our financial measures is impacted by business realignment charges, including the 2015 productivity initiative; asset impairment charges; costs relating to business and asset acquisitions and disposals; loss on early extinguishment of debt; and non-service related components of our pension expense (income).
to provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present performance, we use non-gaap financial measures within md&a that exclude the financial impact of these activities. these non-gaap financial measures are used by management in evaluating results of operations internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business, but they are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap. a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures referenced in md&a to their nearest comparable gaap financial measures as presented in the consolidated statements of income is provided below.

details of the activities impacting comparability that are presented as reconciling items to derive the non-gaap financial measures in the tables above are as follows:
2015 productivity initiative in june 2015, we announced a new productivity initiative, which is intended to move decision making closer to the customer and the consumer, to enable a more enterprise-wide approach to innovation, to more swiftly advance our knowledge agenda, and to provide for a more efficient cost structure, while ensuring that we effectively allocate resources to future growth areas. the project is intended to simplify the organizational structure to enhance the company's ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer. we recorded pre-tax charges related to this program of $105.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
other business realignment activities we periodically undertake restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of ongoing efforts to enhance long-term profitability. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded pre-tax charges of $12.6 million relating to programs commenced in 2014 to rationalize certain non-u.s. manufacturing and distribution activities and to establish our own sales and distribution teams in brazil in connection with our purchase of the non-controlling interest from our joint venture partner. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred pre-tax charges of $12.0 million and $19.1 million, respectively, primarily relating to the demolition of the company's former manufacturing facility, representing the final phase of the project next century program. this program was substantially complete as of december 31, 2014.
acquisition and integration costs for the year ended december 31, 2015, we incurred costs related to integration of the 2014 acquisitions of sgm and allan candy and the 2015 acquisition of krave totaling $22.5 million as we incorporate these businesses into our operating practices and information systems. this includes charges incurred to write-down approximately $6.4 million of expired or near-expiration work-in-process inventory at sgm, in connection with the implementation of our global quality standards and practices. in addition, integration costs for the year were benefited by a $6.8 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration paid to the krave shareholders. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred pre-tax acquisition and integration costs of $13.3 million and charges of $4.1 million, respectively. the 2014 and 2013 charges were largely related to sgm acquisition and integration costs. the 2014 charges were also offset by a $4.6 million gain relating to the acquisition of a controlling interest in lotte shanghai food company.

non-service related pension expense (income)
non-service-related pension expense (income) includes interest costs, the expected return on pension plan assets, the amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits. the non-service-related pension expense (income) can fluctuate from year-to-year as a result of changes in market interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets. we believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from year-to-year. therefore, we exclude the non-service-related pension expense (income) from our internal performance measures. our most significant defined benefit pension plans were closed to most new participants in 2007, resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable. we recorded pre-tax non-service related pension expense (income) of $18.1 million, $(1.8) million and $10.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the 2015 expense adjustment includes approximately $9.6 million in settlement charges relating to lump-sum distributions to participants that did not separate in connection with the 2015 productivity initiative; settlement charges relating to individuals separating in connection with the 2015 productivity initiative are included within the "2015 productivity initiative" costs noted above.
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in the second and third quarters of 2015, we recorded a total $280.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, representing a write-down of all of the goodwill resulting from the sgm acquisition, including $14.4 million relating to the portion of goodwill that had been allocated to our china chocolate reporting unit, based on synergies to be realized by this business. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges totaling $15.9 million associated with our business in india.
loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2015, we recorded within interest expense a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $28.3 million relating to a cash tender offer. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
loss on mauna loa divestiture in december 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell mauna loa, at which time the entity was recorded as held for sale and we recorded an estimated loss of $22.3 million to reflect the disposal entity at its fair value, less an estimate of the selling costs. the transaction closed in the first quarter of 2015, resulting in the recording of an additional loss on sale of $2.7 million, based on updates to the selling expenses and tax benefits.
gain on sale of trademark in 2015, we recorded a $9.9 million gain relating to the sale of a non-core trademark.

net sales
2015 compared with 2014
net sales decreased 0.5% in 2015 compared with 2014, reflecting volume declines of 3.4% and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.6%, substantially offset by favorable net price realization of 3.5% as well as a 1.0% benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures. the favorable net price realization, primarily in the u.s., was attributed to the price increase announced in mid-2014. the volume declines were attributed to volume elasticity relating to the pricing action in the u.s. as well as lower everyday product sales given the challenging shopper environment in north america, coupled with lower sales in china. excluding foreign currency, our net sales increased 1.1% in 2015.
2014 compared with 2013
net sales increased 3.9% in 2014 compared with 2013, reflecting volume growth of 4.4% and favorable net price realization of 0.2%, offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 0.7%. the volume growth was driven by incremental sales of new products in our north america and international and other segments, coupled with almost 1% of growth from the recent sgm acquisition. the pricing benefit from the 2014 mid-year price increase was largely offset by higher trade promotions and lower core volumes associated with near-term volume elasticity related to the price increase.

consumer takeaway and the change in market share are provided for measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our u.s. confectionery retail business. these channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers, and convenience store channels, plus wal-mart stores, inc., partial dollar, club and military channels.
these metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by nielsen and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category. in 2015, the category and hershey growth rates continue to be impacted by changing consumer shopping habits and increased levels of distribution and in-store activity of items such as salty, bakery and meat snacks, by both mainstream and newer contemporary niche manufacturers, which has been driving broader snacking category growth in 2014 and 2015. despite these market dynamics, for the full year 2015, our u.s. cmg retail takeaway increased 2.4%, which was in line with category growth. our market share decreased by 10 basis points; however, we maintained an industry leading 31.3% u.s. market share.
cost of sales and gross margin
2015 compared with 2014
cost of sales decreased 2.0% in 2015 compared with 2014. supply chain productivity and volume declines reduced cost of sales by approximately 6.6%. these declines were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs, and unfavorable sales mix, which together increased total cost of sales by approximately 4.1%. in addition, cost of sales was impacted by acquisition and integration costs of $7.3 million, business realignment charges of $8.8 million and non-service related pension expense of $2.5 million, which collectively increased cost of sales by approximately 0.5%. in comparison, cost of sales benefited by $1.1 million in 2014, primarily due to non-service related pension income.
gross margin increased by 80 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014. favorable net price realization as well as supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives collectively improved gross margin by 330 basis points. however, these benefits were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs as well as unfavorable sales mix, which collectively reduced gross margin by approximately 250 basis points. on a non-gaap basis, excluding the business realignment and acquisition and integration charges, 2015 gross margin increased by 110 basis points.
2014 compared with 2013
cost of sales increased 5.7% in 2014 compared with 2013. higher costs associated with sales volume increases, higher commodity and other incremental supply chain costs and unfavorable sales mix increased total cost of sales by approximately 7.8%. the higher commodity costs were largely driven by higher dairy ingredient costs, which cannot be effectively hedged, while the unfavorable sales mix resulted from a greater proportion of seasonal sales volumes, which are typically at lower margins than non-seasonal products. these cost increases were offset in part by supply chain productivity improvements and lower pension costs, which together reduced cost of sales by approximately 2.1%.
gross margin decreased by 90 basis points in 2014 compared with 2013. supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives, favorable net price realization, and operating leverage from the higher sales volumes collectively improved gross margin by 150 basis points. the impact of lower pension expenses in 2014 in comparison with 2013 benefited 2014 gross margin by 20 basis points. however, these benefits were more than offset by higher commodity and other input costs and unfavorable sales mix which together reduced gross profit margin by approximately 260 basis points.
selling, marketing and administrative
2015 compared with 2014
selling, marketing and administrative ("sm&a") expenses increased $70.9 million or 3.7% in 2015. advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 1.0% during this period. excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs, selling and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by 6.7% as compared to 2014, driven by incremental increases from acquired businesses. excluding the impact of acquisition costs, sm&a expenses for 2015 declined as a result of our continued focus on non-essential spending. sm&a expenses in 2015 were also
24
impacted by charges of $13.6 million attributed to the 2015 productivity initiative, acquisition and integration costs of $13.6 million, non-service related pension expense of $15.6 million and other business realignment charges of $3.7 million. in 2014, sm&a expenses included acquisition and integration costs of $12.4 million, other business realignment charges of $2.9 million and non-service related pension expense of $0.9 million.
2014 compared with 2013
sm&a expenses decreased $25.7 million or 1.3% in 2014. this includes a 3.1% reduction in advertising and related consumer marketing expenses due to the timing of new product launches, a reduction in media production costs and a decision to shift resources to other more productive areas. excluding advertising and related consumer marketing expenses, selling and administrative expenses were relatively flat compared to 2013 due to lower incentive compensation costs and discretionary cost containment efforts, offset in part by higher employee-related costs, including additional headcount in our china business and additional focused selling resources, as well as transaction costs associated with the acquisition of sgm. selling and administrative expenses in 2014 also benefited from the $5.6 million in foreign currency gains realized on forward contracts related to the manufacturing facility under construction in johor, malaysia.
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges as discussed in the overview and outlook section as well as note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the sgm business performed below expectations throughout 2015, with net sales and earnings levels well below pre-acquisition levels. as of result of this declining performance, in the second quarter we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of $249.8 million relating to the sgm reporting unit. during the third quarter, we updated our estimates of the acquisition-date fair values of the net assets acquired, which increased the value of acquired goodwill by $16.6 million. we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit, which resulted in an additional $16.6 million write-off of this increase to goodwill. during the third quarter, we also wrote off $14.4 million of goodwill that resulted from the sgm acquisition and was assigned to our existing china chocolate business, as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkey-branded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks. this goodwill impairment was driven by the continued declining performance in our china chocolate business through the third quarter, as a result of macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer shopping behavior mentioned previously.
in 2014, the annual impairment testing of our india reporting unit resulted in a $11.4 million goodwill impairment charge and a $4.5 million pre-tax write-down of a trademark associated with the india business. these impairment charges were largely a result of our decision to exit the oils portion of the india business and realign our approach to regional marketing and distribution in india.
the assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets is based on management estimates and assumptions, as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k. these estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.

2015 productivity initiative on june 19, 2015, we announced a new productivity initiative (the "2015 productivity initiative") intended to move decision making closer to the customer and the consumer, to enable a more enterprise-wide approach to innovation, to more swiftly advance our knowledge agenda, and to provide for a more efficient cost structure, while ensuring that we effectively allocate resources to future growth areas. overall, the 2015 initiative is intended to simplify the organizational structure to enhance the company's ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer.
the 2015 productivity initiative was executed throughout the third and fourth quarters, resulting in a net reduction of approximately 300 positions, with the majority of the departures taking place by the end of 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we incurred charges totaling $105.7 million, representing employee severance and related separation benefits as well as incremental third-party costs related to the design and implementation of the new organizational structure. this also includes a pension settlement cost of $10.2 million relating to lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the company as a result of the 2015 productivity initiative.
total pre-tax charges and costs for this program are expected to be approximately $120 million, the majority of which are cash. this excludes the 2015 pension settlement costs and any additional pension settlement costs that could be triggered by additional lump sum withdrawals in 2016. the remaining costs are expected to be incurred within the first three quarters of 2016.
other international restructuring programs other 2015 charges for business realignment activities relate principally to accelerated depreciation and amortization and employee severance costs for programs commenced in 2014 to rationalize certain non-u.s. manufacturing and distribution activities and to establish our own sales and distribution teams in brazil in connection with our purchase of the non-controlling interest from our joint venture partner. remaining costs relating to these programs are not expected to be significant.
divestiture of mauna loa in december 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell the mauna loa macadamia nut corporation ("mauna loa").
26
as a result of the expected sale, in 2014 we recorded an estimated loss on the anticipated sale of $22.3 million to reflect the disposal entity at fair value, less an estimate of the selling costs. the sale was completed in the first quarter of 2015, resulted in an additional loss on sale of $2.7 million based on updates to the selling expenses and tax benefits.
next century program the 2014 and 2013 charges shown above relate primarily to the demolition of the company's former manufacturing facility, representing the final phase of the project next century program ("next century program"). this program was substantially complete as of december 31, 2014.
the restructuring charges discussed above for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 relate predominantly to initiatives undertaken by the north america segment, with the exception of the international programs, which relate to the international and other segment. segment operating results do not include business realignment and related charges as these initiatives are generally centrally managed and are not included within our internal measures of segment performance.
operating profit and operating profit margin
2015 compared with 2014
operating profit decreased 25.5% in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to the goodwill impairment charges, higher selling, marketing and administrative costs related to acquisitions as well as higher business realignment charges, offset in part by the higher gross profit.
operating profit margin decreased to 14.0% in 2015 from 18.8% in 2014 due to the goodwill impairment charges, higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent of sales, and higher business realignment charges.
on a non-gaap basis, 2015 operating profit and operating profit margin increased 1.8% and 40 basis points, respectively.
2014 compared with 2013
operating profit increased 4.1% in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to the higher level of gross profit and lower overall selling, marketing and administrative costs, offset in part by higher business realignment and impairment charges in 2014.
operating profit margin increased to 18.8% in 2014 from 18.7% in 2013 due to lower sm&a expenses as a percent of sales, partially offset by higher business realignment and impairment charges.
interest expense, net
2015 compared with 2014
net interest expense was $22.3 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 due primarily to the premium paid to repurchase long-term debt as part of a cash tender offer. this increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest expense coupled with savings resulting from fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements put in place towards the end of 2014.
2014 compared with 2013
net interest expense was $4.9 million lower in 2014 than in 2013 due primarily to a greater level of capitalized interest in 2014 as well as higher interest income earned on short-term investments.
27
other (income) expense, net
2015 compared with 2014
other (income) expense, net was $27.4 million higher in 2015 than 2014, due primarily to the write-down of equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits, partially offset by the gain on the sale of a non-core trademark.
2014 compared with 2013
other (income) expense, net reflected a net expense of $2.7 million in 2014 compared to a net gain of $1.6 million in 2013, due primarily to the foreign exchange loss related to our strategy to cap the u.s. denominated acquisition price of sgm, offset in part by the gain realized on the acquisition of a controlling interest in lotte shanghai food company.
income taxes and effective tax rate
2015 compared with 2014
our effective income tax rate was 43.1% for 2015 compared with 35.2% for 2014. the 2015 tax rate was significantly impacted by the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and other non-gaap charges, the 2015 effective income tax rate was 130 basis points lower than the 2014 rate. the 2015 rate benefited from tax credits realized from the investment tax strategy initiated in the second quarter of 2015, which was partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against the sgm net operating loss carryforwards.
2014 compared with 2013
our effective income tax rate was 35.2% for 2014 compared with 34.4% for 2013. the 2014 effective income tax rate was higher due to unfavorable tax return true-up adjustments, unfavorable shifts of taxable income to higher tax jurisdictions, and the impact of business realignment and impairment charges with minimal tax benefit, partly offset by favorable settlement of canadian assessments and favorable settlement of u.s. audits.
net income and net income per share
2015 compared with 2014
net income decreased $333.9 million, or 39.4%, while earnings per share-diluted ("eps") decreased $1.45, or 38.5%, in 2015 compared with 2014. the decreases in both net income and eps were driven by the goodwill impairment charges, higher selling, marketing and administrative costs related to acquisitions as well as higher business realignment charges, as noted above. our 2015 eps also benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding, as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our board-approved repurchase programs.
on a non-gaap basis, net income increased $13.8 million in 2015, or 1.5%, and eps increased $0.14, or 3.5%, as compared with 2014. the increases in 2015 non-gaap net income and eps were primarily driven by gross margin expansion and lower net interest expense.
2014 compared with 2013
net income increased $26.4 million, or 3.2%, while eps-diluted increased $0.16, or 4.4%, in 2014 compared with 2013. the increases in both net income and eps were driven by higher sales, offset by higher commodity costs and unfavorable sales mix, as noted above. our 2014 eps also benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding, as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our board-approved repurchase programs.
on a non-gaap basis, net income increased $51.6 million in 2015, or 6.1%, and eps increased $0.26, or 7.0%, as compared with 2013. the increases in 2014 non-gaap net income and eps were primarily driven by lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent of sales.

segment results the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments: north america and international and other. the segments reflect our operations on a geographic basis. for segment reporting purposes, we use "segment income" to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, as well as business realignment initiatives, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, the non-service related portion of pension expense and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. these items of our operating income are managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the codm and used for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-gaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not integral to our ongoing operations. for further information, see the non-gaap disclosures at the beginning of this item 7.

north america the north america segment is responsible for our chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position, as well as our grocery and growing snacks market positions, in the united states and canada. this includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, pantry, food service and other snacking product lines. north america accounted for 87.6%, 85.6% and 86.8% of our net sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. north america results for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:

net sales of our north america segment increased $115.4 million or 1.8% in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting net price realization of 4.8% and the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 0.3%, substantially offset by volume declines of 2.5% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 0.8%. the volume decline was due to elasticity related to the 2014 pricing action as well as lower everyday product sales, which have been impacted by changing consumer shopping habits, such as channel shifting and e-commerce, an increase in competitive activity and a proliferation of broader snacking options in the marketplace. our canada operations were impacted by the stronger u.s. dollar, which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact.
our north america segment income increased $157.8 million or 8.2% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by gross margin expansion, primarily due to favorable price realization and supply chain productivity which offset volume declines and input cost increases.
2014 compared with 2013
net sales of our north america segment increased $152.6 million or 2.5% in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting volume growth of 2.4%, net price realization of 0.5% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 0.4%. 2014 new product introductions, including york and kit kat minis, nutrageous relaunch, brookside crunchy clusters, lancaster soft cremes and hershey's spreads, drove the volume growth, as sales volumes for core, everyday products were unfavorably impacted by increased levels of distribution and in-store activity from confection and other snacking categories. higher levels of trade promotion reduced the benefit from the 2014 mid-year pricing action. our canada operations were impacted by the stronger u.s. dollar, which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact.
our north america segment income increased $53.6 million or 2.9% in 2014 compared to 2013, principally due to higher sales volumes and supply chain productivity improvements, which offset input cost increases and unfavorable sales mix. our core product mix in 2014 was more heavily weighted toward seasonal offerings which typically generate lower margins than our core, everyday instant consumable products. additionally, advertising, consumer promotions and marketing expenses decreased 2.8% in 2014 due to the timing of new product launches, a reduction in media production costs, and a decision to shift resources to other more productive areas.
international and other the international and other segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture, import, market, sell or distribute chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and other products. currently, this includes our operations in china and other asia markets, latin america, europe, africa and the middle east, along with exports to these regions. while a less significant component, this segment also includes our global retail operations, including hershey's chocolate world stores in hershey, pennsylvania, new york city, chicago, las vegas, shanghai, niagara falls (ontario), dubai and singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world. international and other accounted for 12.4%, 14.4% and 13.2% of our net

sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. international and other results for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:

2015 compared with 2014
net sales of our international and other segment decreased $150.6 million or 14.1% in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting volume declines of 9.0%, the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 6.2%, and unfavorable net price realization of 4.0%, partially offset by incremental revenue from the acquisition of sgm representing an increase of 5.1% to 2015 net sales. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the net sales of our international and other segment declined approximately 7.9%.
the net sales decline was driven by volume declines in our china chocolate business. in 2015, chocolate category growth in china was flat relative to the prior year; however our 2015 chocolate retail takeaway in china declined by 11%, resulting in a market share decline in china of 1.1%. we believe that the category continues to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer shopping behavior as accelerated e-commerce and on-line purchases of broader consumer staples are leading to lower trips to tier 1 hypermarkets, where the majority of our chocolate sales are derived, adversely impacting the impulse-oriented chocolate category.
performance in our focus markets of mexico and brazil improved and, on a constant currency basis, net sales in 2015 in these countries increased by approximately 6% and 3%, respectively, versus 2014. constant currency net sales in india declined in 2015, primarily due to the planned discontinuance of edible oil products.
our international and other segment loss was $98.1 million in 2015 compared to segment income of $40.0 million in 2014. the decline was primarily attributable to lower net sales of chocolate products in china, coupled with losses at sgm as that business has also been impacted by the uncertain macroeconomic conditions in china as well as incremental integration-related costs.
2014 compared with 2013
net sales of our international and other segment increased $123.1 million or 13.0% in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting volume growth of 17.0%, unfavorable net price realization of 1.7%, and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 2.3%. the sales volume increase was primarily due to increased demand for new and existing products in china as well as $54 million of incremental sales from the newly acquired sgm business. excluding sgm, our 2014 chocolate net sales grew 35% in china and we increased our market share to almost 10% of the chocolate category. our 2014 sales in mexico were unfavorably impacted by the challenging economic environment, while our brazil performance improved sequentially as the year progressed, finishing 2014 up approximately 7% from the prior year, excluding the impact of unfavorable currency. the unfavorable price realization reflects increased trade promotions and allowances, particularly in china and mexico where we have made additional investments to drive sales volume growth.
our international and other segment income decreased $4.6 million or 10.3% in 2014 compared to 2013, as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by higher trade promotions and a 5.9% higher investment in advertising to support core brands and the introduction of new products in our international markets. the most significant portion of this investment was focused on our china and mexico markets. we also increased headcount, particularly in china in support of sales growth.

unallocated corporate items unallocated corporate administration includes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and (d) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance.
in 2015, unallocated corporate items totaled $497.4 million compared to $503.2 million in 2014, with the reduction driven primarily by the implementation of the 2015 productivity initiative discussed previously.
in 2014, unallocated corporate items totaled $503.2 million compared to $535.1 million in 2013, with the reduction driven by lower incentive compensation expense as well as discretionary cost containment measures intended to mitigate the higher commodity and other input costs in 2014.
32
financial condition we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, repurchase of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. we generate substantial cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment, payment of dividends and strategic acquisitions.
cash flow summary the following table is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows:
in millions of dollars                                         2015                  2014                               2013

operating activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper.
cash provided by operating activities in 2015 increased $370.0 million relative to 2014. this increase was driven by the following factors:
•   working capital (comprised of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable) generated cash of $22 million in 2015, while it consumed cash of $169 million in 2014. this fluctuation was mainly driven by lower inventory purchases in the 2015 period, since certain raw material inventory had been built up at the preceding year-end to take advantage of favorable pricing.
•   our hedging activities favorably impacted cash flow by $55 million in 2015 versus an unfavorable impact of $78 million in 2014, due principally to market gains and losses on our commodity futures. our cash receipts typically increase when futures market prices are increasing.
•   2015 cash flow was favorably impacted by approximately $30 million from the timing of tax payments in 2015 compared to 2014.
cash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased $347.0 million as compared to 2013, primarily due to a $140 million incremental investment in working capital to support the high sales volumes, partially offset by increased net earnings in 2014. derivative activities had a $78 million unfavorable impact on 2014 operating cash flow and $101 million favorable impact on 2013 operating cash flow.
pension and post-retirement activity. we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $66.8 million, $37.3 million and $55.0 million 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans). the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including discount rates used to value plan obligations, expected returns on plan assets, the service and interest costs, and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses. the 2015 costs also include net settlement and curtailment charges of $22.4 million, that were triggered by the 2015 productivity initiative.
33
the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and the level of funding. we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled $53.3 million, $53.1 million and $57.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
investing activities our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, purchases of short-term investments and acquisitions of businesses, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment and short-term investments. we used cash of $477.2 million for investing activities in 2015 compared to $862.6 million in 2014, with the decrease driven by less business acquisition activity and proceeds from the sale of short term investments. we used cash of $351.6 million for investing activities in 2013, which was primarily driven by capital expenditures relating to the malaysia facility and the next century program.
primary investing activities include the following:
•   capital spending. capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation, and cost savings, were $329.7 million in 2015, $345.9 million in 2014 and $323.6 million in 2013. our 2015 expenditures included approximately $80 million relating to the construction of a manufacturing facility in malaysia, compared to $115 million in 2014. capital expenditures in 2013 included $40 million relating to the malaysia facility and $11.8 million relating to the next century program. capitalized software additions were primarily related to ongoing enhancements of our information systems. we expect 2016 capital expenditures, including capitalized software, to approximate $285 million to $295 million.
•   acquisitions. in 2015, we spent $218.7 million to acquire krave. in 2014, we spent $396.3 million to acquire three businesses, including $379.7 million for sgm and $26.6 million for allan, partially offset by net cash received of $10.0 million relating to the lsfc acquisition, whereby cash acquired in the transaction exceeded the $5.6 million paid for the controlling interest. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our recent acquisitions.
financing activities our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. we used cash of $755.2 million for financing activities in 2015 compared to $719.3 million in 2014, with the increase due mainly to higher dividend payments and repayments of long term debt and short term borrowings, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of long term borrowings. our cash used in 2014 exceeded our cash used for financing activities in 2013 by $272.7 million, primarily due to higher dividend payments and share repurchases.
the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following:
•   short-term borrowings, net. in addition to utilizing cash on hand, we use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. in 2015, we generated cash flow of $10.7 million from higher borrowings at certain of our international businesses. in 2014, we generated additional cash flow from the issuance of $55.0 million in commercial paper.
•   long-term debt borrowings and repayments. in 2015, we used $355 million to repay long-term debt, including $100.2 million to repurchase $71.6 million of our long-term debt as part of a cash tender offer. additionally, in 2015, we issued $300 million of 1.60% notes due in 2018 and $300 million of 3.20% notes due in 2025. we had no repayment activity in 2014. in 2013, we repaid $250 million of 5.0% notes due in 2013 and issued $250 million of 2.625% notes due in 2023.
•   share repurchases. we repurchase shares of common stock to offset the dilutive impact of treasury shares issued under our equity compensation plans. the value of these share repurchases in a given period varies based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price. in addition, we periodically repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to board-authorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder value. we used cash for total share repurchases of $582.5 million in 2015, compared to $576.5 million in
34
2014. this includes purchases pursuant to authorized programs of $402.5 million to purchase 4.2 million shares in 2015 and $202.3 million to purchase 2.1 million shares in 2014. we had no share repurchases under these programs in 2013. as of december 31, 2015, approximately $20 million remained available under the $250 million share repurchase authorization approved by the board in february 2015. in january 2016, our board of directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization, to commence after the existing 2015 authorization is completed.
•   dividend payments. total dividend payments to holders of our common stock and class b common stock were $476.1 million in 2015, $440.4 million in 2014 and $393.8 million in 2013. dividends per share of common stock increased 9.6% to $2.236 per share in 2015 compared to $2.04 per share in 2014, while dividends per share of class b common stock increased 10.3% in 2015.
•   proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including tax benefits. we received $97.6 million from employee exercises of stock options, including excess tax benefits, in 2015, as compared to $175.8 million in 2014 and $195.7 million in 2013. variances are driven by the number of shares exercised and the share price at the date of grant.
•   other. in september 2015, we acquired the remaining 49% interest in hershey do brasil under a cooperative agreement with pandurata netherlands b.v. ("bauducco") for approximately $38.3 million. additionally, in december 2015, we paid $10.0 million in contingent consideration to the shareholders of krave.
liquidity and capital resources at december 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $346.5 million. at december 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $374.9 million, and we held short-term investments in the form of term deposits with original maturities of one-year totaling $97.1 million. in total, our cash and short-term investment holdings at the end of 2015 declined $125.5 million compared to the 2014 year-end balance as a result of the net uses of cash outlined in the previous discussion.
approximately half of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2015 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states. if these amounts held outside of the united states were to be repatriated, under current law they would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states. the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is expected to be used to finance foreign operations and investments. we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs, including our cash needs in the united states.
we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders' equity. our total debt was $2.4 billion at december 31, 2015 and $2.2 billion at december 31, 2014. our total debt increased in 2015 mainly due to the additional debt issued mid-year to repay commercial paper that had been used to fund the krave acquisition in the first quarter of 2015.
in october 2011, we entered into a five-year agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $1.1 billion, with an option to increase borrowings by an additional $400 million with the consent of the lenders. in november 2013, this agreement was amended to reduce the amount of borrowings available under the unsecured revolving credit facility to $1.0 billion, maintain the option to increase borrowings by an additional $400 million with the consent of the lenders, and extend the termination date to november 2018. as of december 31, 2015, the termination date of this agreement has been extended to november 2020. as of december 31, 2015, $1.0 billion was available to borrow under the agreement and no borrowings were outstanding. the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties and events of default. we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31, 2015. we may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions.
in addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks. as of december 31, 2015, we had available capacity of $203.4 million under these lines of credit.
35
furthermore, we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the united states securities and exchange commission that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements, including reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions, and funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements.
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.
equity structure we have two classes of stock outstanding - common stock and class b common stock ("class b stock"). holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share. holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share. holders of the common stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our board. with respect to dividend rights, holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock.
hershey trust company, as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school, maintains voting control over the hershey company. in addition, hershey trust company currently has three representatives who are members of the company's board, one of whom is the lead independent director. these representatives, from time to time in performing their responsibilities on the company's board, may exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management. hershey trust company, as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school, in its role as controlling stockholder of the company, has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and that the company board, and not the hershey trust company board, is solely responsible and accountable for the company's management and performance.
pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company, as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school, no longer having voting control of the company. the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the hershey trust company, as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school, to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company.
guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.

(1) includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. interest associated with variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward curve as of december 31, 2015.
(2) includes the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases primarily for offices, retail stores, warehouses and distribution facilities, and certain equipment. we do not have material capital lease obligations.
(3) represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ("erisa"), federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006. we fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. for more information, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
(4) purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business. amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31, 2015. the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at year-end 2015, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.
in entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults.
asset retirement obligations we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. costs associated with the removal of asbestos related to the closure of a manufacturing facility under the next century program were recorded primarily in 2012 and included in business realignment and impairment charges. the costs associated with the removal of asbestos from the facility were not material. with regard to other facilities, we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos.
income tax obligations liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions. we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
l   accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities l   pension and other post-retirement benefits plans l   goodwill and other intangible assets l   commodities futures and options contracts l   income taxes management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board. while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities we promote our products with advertising, trade promotions and consumer incentives. these programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred. we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past.
our trade promotional costs totaled $1,122.3 million, $1,125.5 million and $995.7 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant. over the three-year period ended december 31, 2015, actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount for a given year by more than approximately 3%.
pension and other post-retirement benefits plans we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans. the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees, which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most u.s. employees hired prior to january 1, 2007. we also sponsor two primary other post-employment benefit ("opeb") plans, consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees. the health care plan is contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory.
for accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations.

the net periodic benefit costs relating to our pension and opeb plans were as follows:
for the years ended december 31,                                                        2015   2014                         2013
in millions of dollars pension plans service cost and amortization of prior service cost (1)                            $27.1             $26.3             $31.8
interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of net loss           5.9              (1.9   )          11.2
curtailment and settlement loss (credit)                                            22.4                 -              (0.4   )
net periodic pension benefit cost                                                  $55.4             $24.4             $42.6
opeb plans net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost                                    $11.5             $12.9             $12.4
(1) we believe that the service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost reflect the ongoing operating cost of our pension plans, particularly since our most significant plans were closed to most new entrants after 2007.
actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans' obligations. we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of a respective plan's projected benefit obligation, or the fair market value of assets, if greater. the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2016 is $35.2 million. the 2015 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was $30.5 million.
the weighted-average assumptions for our pension and opeb plans were as follows:
2015        2014        2013
pension plans expense discount rate                 3.7   %     4.5   %     3.7   %
benefit obligation discount rate      4.0   %     3.7   %     4.5   %
expected return on plan assets        6.3   %     7.0   %     7.8   %
expected rate of salary increases     4.1   %     4.0   %     4.0   %
opeb plans expense discount rate                 3.7   %     4.5   %     3.7   %
benefit obligation discount rate      4.0   %     3.7   %     4.5   %
to determine the expected return on our pension plan assets, we consider the current asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets. the historical average return over the 28 years prior to december 31, 2015 was approximately 8.3%. the actual return on assets was (2.3%), 8.4% and 16.7% for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our investment policies specify target allocation percentages for each asset class. the current estimated asset return is based upon the following targeted asset allocation for our domestic pension plans as of december 31, 2015:
asset class         target asset allocation equity securities                       50%
debt securities                         49%
cash                                     1%

sensitivity of assumptions since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. the discount rate used for our pension and opeb plans is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the estimated payouts of the plans. a 100 basis point decline in the weighted average pension discount rate would increase net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $4.7 million. a decrease in the opeb discount rate by 100 basis points would decrease annual opeb expense by approximately $0.5 million. for the opeb plans, a decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a decrease in benefit cost because of the lower interest cost, which would more than offset the impact of the lower discount rate assumption on the post-retirement benefit obligation.
the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since certain of our defined benefit pension plans are partially funded. for 2016, we reduced the expected rate of return assumption to 6.1% from the 6.3% assumption used in 2015, to reflect lower expected long-term returns due to slowing growth in developed and emerging markets. the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the rate of return for pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $11.0 million.
for year-end 2015, we adopted the society of actuaries updated rp-2014 mortality tables with mp-2015 generational projection scales; however, adoption of these tables did not have a significant impact on our pension obligations or net period benefit cost since our primary plans are cash balance plans and most participants take lump-sum settlements upon retirement.
funding we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by erisa, federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006. we fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. the annual minimum cash funding requirements for our plans are not material. however, we made contributions of $32.9 million in 2015 and $29.4 million in 2014, including $22.9 million in 2015 and $22.0 million in 2014 to maintain the funded status of our domestic plans as well as contributions to pay benefits under our non-qualified pension plans in both years. these contributions were fully tax deductible. we expect to make additional contributions of approximately $18.5 million to our domestic plans in 2016.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
we use a two-step process to quantitatively evaluate goodwill for impairment. in the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record. in the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference. we test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value with the book values of each asset.
we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach. under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value. our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending. additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses. we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for
40
similar valuation purposes. such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.
we also have intangible assets, consisting primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions, that are expected to have determinable useful lives. the costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finite-lived assets may not be recoverable. undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. if an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets.
as discussed in note 2, based on the declining performance levels and the results of our post-acquisition assessment, we determined that an interim impairment test of the sgm reporting unit was required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. we performed the first step of this test as of july 5, 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business. the results of this test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying amount as of the measurement date, suggesting that a goodwill impairment was probable, which required us to perform a second step analysis to confirm that an impairment existed and to determine the amount of the impairment based on our reassessed value of the reporting unit. although preliminary, as a result of this reassessment, in the second quarter of 2015 we recorded an estimated $249.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, representing a write-down of all of the goodwill related to the sgm reporting unit as of july 5, 2015. during the third quarter, we increased the value of acquired goodwill by $16.6 million, with the corresponding offset principally represented by the establishment of additional opening balance sheet liabilities for additional commitments and contingencies that were identified through our post-acquisition assessment. we also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the sgm reporting unit, which resulted in a write-off of this additional goodwill in the third quarter, for a total impairment of $266.4 million. we also tested the other long-lived assets of sgm for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group, and no impairment was indicated.
in connection with the sgm acquisition, we assigned approximately $15 million of goodwill to our existing china chocolate business, as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of golden monkey-branded product through its tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks. as the net sales and earnings of our china business continued to be adversely impacted by macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer shopping behavior through the third quarter, we determined that an interim impairment test of the goodwill in this reporting unit was also required. we performed the first step of this test in the third quarter of 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business. the results of this test suggested that a goodwill impairment was probable, and the conclusions of the second step analysis resulted in a write-down of $14.4 million, representing the full value of goodwill attributed to this reporting unit as of october 4, 2015. we also tested the other long-lived assets of the china asset group for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group, and no impairment was indicated.
at december 31, 2015, after considering the impairments noted above, the remaining net book value of our goodwill totaled $684.3 million and related to seven reporting units. as it relates to our annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter, no additional goodwill impairment was indicated, and the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value was at least 50% for each of our tested reporting units, with the exception of our krave reporting unit, which includes goodwill of $147.1 million. this reporting unit comprises a recently acquired business whose estimated fair value approximates its carrying value.
during our 2014 annual testing, the fair value of our india reporting unit approximated its carrying value. as a result and given the sensitivity of the india impairment analysis to changes in the underlying assumptions, we performed a step two analysis which indicated a goodwill impairment of $11.4 million. in addition, our 2014 annual test of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in a $4.5 million pre-tax write-down of a trademark, also associated with the india business. also in 2014, in connection with the anticipated sale of our mauna loa business (as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, we recorded estimated impairment charges totaling $18.5 million to write-down goodwill and an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, based on the valuation of these assets as implied by the agreed-upon sales price.

commodities futures and options contracts as discussed in note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, we use derivative financial instruments to manage a number of our market risks. specifically, we use commodities futures and options contracts, in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities, to manage our commodity price risk, which represents a significant market risk exposure for us.
we have historically applied hedge accounting to our commodity derivative instruments. in order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. we must formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. we must also maintain certain operational processes and controls that support the conduct of our commodities hedging program. additionally, since these are typically hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transactions will occur. if it is no longer probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.
because we generally have designated these commodity future and option contracts as derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships, our mark-to-market gains (losses) were deferred to accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci"). the amounts deferred and reclassified from aoci were as follows:
for the years ended december 31,                                                             2015                2014              2013
in millions of dollars net gains (losses) deferred to aoci for commodity cash flow hedging derivatives         $84.4              $(11.2   )         $84.7
gains (losses) reclassified from aoci to earnings                                        40.6                68.5              (8.4   )
hedge ineffectiveness gains recognized in income, before tax                              1.0                 2.5               3.2
as discussed in item 9a. controls and procedures, our cocoa commodity derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2015. therefore, changes in the fair value of cocoa commodity derivatives for the third and fourth quarters of 2015 were recorded as incurred within cost of sales in the income statement.
effective january 1, 2016, we are no longer electing to designate any of our existing or new cocoa or other commodity derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. additionally, we have revised our definition of segment income and redefined non-gaap income and earnings per share measures to exclude gains and losses on commodity derivatives until the related inventory is sold. this change to our definition of segment income and non-gaap income and non-gaap earnings per share will continue to reflect the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our reported segment income as well as non-gaap income and non-gaap earnings per share.
income taxes we base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our company, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved. from time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. we maintain reserves for such assessments.
we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change. while it is often difficult to predict the final
42
outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash. favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. our valuation allowances are primarily related to u.s. capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions' net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit.

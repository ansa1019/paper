item 1a.   risk factors

risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.
as of december 31, 2015, we had $3.29 billion in total consolidated indebtedness. in addition, we had $1.7 billion undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility. subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions.
our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. for example, our indebtedness could:
●   place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources;

●   limit our ability to borrow additional funds;

●   limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;

●   limit our ability to pay dividends;

●   limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and

●   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness.

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business.
several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, canadian dollars, british pounds or danish kroner. sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar represented 20% of our total net sales for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 23% for the year ended december 31, 2014. unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings.
we export a significant portion of our products. difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business.
sales to customers outside the u.s. by our businesses located in the u.s. account for a significant portion of our net sales. these sales accounted for 13% of our net sales for each of the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets. such risks include, without limitation, the following:
●   unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export requirements;

●   restrictions on the export of technology and related products;

●   unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with u.s. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries, including russia;

●   unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and

●   a general economic downturn in our foreign markets.

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and, therefore, could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings.
economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business.
as of and for the year ended december 31, 2015, 21% of our net sales and 14% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the u.s. we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the u.s. including, without limitation, the following:
●   adverse changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in russia and emerging markets;

●   oil price shocks;

●   trade protection measures and import or export requirements;

●   subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations;

●   partial or total expropriation;

●   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

●   difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;

●   differing labor regulations;

●   differing protection of intellectual property; and

●   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements.

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business.
our growth strategy includes acquisitions. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully.
our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. there are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability.
9
acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
product liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results.
our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our products. in addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. we currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. we also maintain other insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. however, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.
our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers.
in some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows. additionally, many of our customers are government entities. in many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency.
we face intense competition. if we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.
we face intense competition from numerous competitors. our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities. we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. in addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner. we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive.
changes in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business.
the availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. in addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.
our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change.
10
we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. in connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. in addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy.
some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. accordingly, a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business.
our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization.
our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2015, goodwill totaled $5.8 billion compared to $5.3 billion of stockholders' equity, and represented 57% of our total assets of $10.2 billion. the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating earnings. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material.
we depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business.
the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. this product development may require substantial internal investment. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology.  actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.
11
we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations.
our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors. a shutdown of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.
any business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance.
if terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the u.s. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with "selected financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report.
overview we are a diversified technology company.  we operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and software-as-a-service) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets; including healthcare, transportation, food, energy, water, education and academic research.
16
we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms.
in 2015, we acquired strata decision technologies llc ("strata"), softwriters inc., data innovations llc, on center software llc ("on center"), rf ideas, inc., atlantic health partners llc ("ahp"), aderant holdings, inc. ("aderant"), and atlas database software corp. ("atlas").  the acquisitions both expanded and complemented our existing technologies.  we also divested abel pumps and black diamond advanced technologies in the current year.
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 included in this annual report.
gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements.
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.
the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec. although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. if an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment.
our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. these issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting.
accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. at december 31, 2015, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $10.0 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $2.4 million, for a total of $12.4 million, or 2.5% of total gross accounts receivable.  this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. the total allowance at december 31, 2015 was $1.3 million lower than at december 31, 2014.  the allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business, the write-off of uncollectible receivables, and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses.
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. when we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. at december 31, 2015, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $34.0 million, or 15.2% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $38.9 million, or 16.7% of gross inventory cost, at december 31, 2014. the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory.
17
most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
revenues related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we recognized revenue of $253 million, $266 million and $205 million, respectively, using this method.  percentage-of-completion is used primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application projects.  at december 31, 2015, $276 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods.
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the u.s., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner.  during 2015, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which was 70 basis points higher than the 2014 rate of 29.9%.  the taxable gain on the divestiture of abel pumps led to an increase of 130 basis points, and was offset in part by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters. we expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2016 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the u.s.
we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter, (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).
when testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.
we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. the first step utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.  to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations.   if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized.  if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit.  if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized.
key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit.  various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples.  while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.
18
we have 32 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $1.2 billion.  in 2015, we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. we conducted our analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. we determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 29 of our reporting units and thus we were not required to perform a quantitative analysis for these reporting units. for the remaining three reporting units we performed our quantitative analysis and concluded that the fair value of each of these three reporting units was in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of december 31, 2015.   negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.
business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value.  we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if necessary, we conduct a quantitative review using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets.  this methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets.  the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of capital.  each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates.  sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables.  reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth.
the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management.  although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units.  changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2015.
we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. if an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.

our medical & scientific imaging segment reported a $135 million or 12.5% increase in net sales for the year ended december 31, 2015 over the year ended december 31, 2014.  acquisitions contributed 11.5%, organic sales increased 3.8% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 2.8%. the increase in organic sales was due to increased sales in our medical businesses, led by verathon and managed health care associates ("mha").  gross margin increased to 74.0% in the year ended december 31, 2015 from 72.1% in the year ended december 31, 2014, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses as a percentage of net sales were relatively unchanged at 37.7% in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 37.4% in the year ended december 31, 2014.  operating margin was 36.4% in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 34.8% in the year ended december 31, 2014.
in our rf technology segment, net sales for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased by $84 million or 9% over the year ended december 31, 2014. organic sales increased by 6%, acquisitions along with the divestiture of the black diamond advanced technology business added 4% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. the increase in organic sales was due primarily to growth in our toll and traffic and freight matching businesses.  gross margin was 53.4% in 2015 as compared to 52.8% in the prior year due to leverage on higher sales volume and product mix.  sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended december 31, 2015 were 23.3%, a decrease from 24.3% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume.  operating margin was 30.2% in 2015 as compared to 28.5% in 2014.
net sales for our industrial technology segment decreased by $82 million or 10% for the year ended december 31, 2015 from the year ended december 31, 2014. organic sales decreased by 4%, the  negative foreign exhange impact was 4% and the divestiture of the abel pumps business accounted for a negative 2%.  the decrease in organic sales was due primarily to decreased sales in those fluid handling businesses that serve oil and gas markets.  gross margin decreased to 49.8% for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 50.5% in the year ended december 31, 2014 due to negative leverage on lower sales volume.  sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales were 21.0%, as compared to 20.5% in the prior year, due primarily to negative leverage on lower sales volume.  the resulting operating margin was 28.8% in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 29.9% in the year ended december 31, 2014.
in our energy systems & controls segment, net sales for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased by $104 million or 15% from the year ended december 31, 2014.  organic sales decreased by 10% due to decreased sales in oil and gas products, including safety systems and valves, and the negative foreign exchange impact was 5%.  gross margin was relatively unchanged at  58.1% in the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 58.3% in the year ended december 31, 2014. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales were 30.5% as compared to 28.9% in the prior year due negative leverage on lower sales volume. operating margin was 27.6% in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 29.3% in the year ended december 31, 2014.
corporate expenses increased by $4.6 million to $102.8 million, or 2.9% of sales, in 2015 as compared to $98.2 million, or 2.8% of sales, in 2014. the increase was due primarily to increased costs related to acquisitions.
interest expense increased $5.6 million, or 7.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.  the increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances offset in part by lower average interest rates throughout 2015.
other income of $58.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 was composed primarily of the $70.9 million gain from the divestiture of abel pumps (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report), offset in part by a $9.5 million impairment charge on a minority investment.  other income of $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 was composed of royalty income and foreign exchange gains at our non-u.s. based companies, offset in part by losses from asset disposals.
during 2015, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which was 70 basis points higher than the 2014 rate of 29.9%.  the taxable gain on the divestiture of abel pumps led to an increase of 130 basis points, and was offset in part by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters.
at december 31, 2015, the functional currencies of most of our non-u.s. subsidiaries were weaker against the u.s. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31, 2014. the net result of these changes led to a pre-tax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $146 million in the year ended december 31, 2015. approximately $62 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. for the entire year of 2015, operating profit decreased by approximately 2% due to fluctuations in non-u.s. currencies.

net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $3.55 billion as compared to sales of $3.24 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of 10%. the increase was the result of organic sales growth of 7% and contributions from acquisitions of 3%.
our medical & scientific imaging segment reported a $178 million or 20% increase in net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 over the year ended december 31, 2013.  acquisitions added $91 million in sales, and organic sales increased 10% due to  increased sales in our medical businesses.  gross margin increased to 72.1% in the year ended december 31, 2014 from 69.3% in the year ended december 31, 2013, due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 37.4% in the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 39.5% in the year ended december 31, 2013 due to leverage on higher sales volume.  operating margin was 34.8% in the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 29.7% in the year ended december 31, 2013.
in our rf technology segment, net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by $46 million or 5% over the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was due primarily to growth in our toll and traffic, university card systems and security solutions businesses.  gross margin was 52.8% in 2014 as compared to 53.7% in the prior year due to product mix.  sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended december 31, 2014 were 24.3%, a decrease from 25.6% in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume.  operating margin was 28.5% in 2014 as compared to 28.0% in 2013.
net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by $48 million or 6% for the year ended december 31, 2014 over the year ended december 31, 2013. organic growth was 7%, and there was a negative 1% impact from foreign currency exchange.  the organic growth was due primarily to increased sales in our water meter, fluid handling and materials testing  businesses.  gross margin was 50.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 51.1% in the year ended december 31, 2013 due to product mix.  sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales were 20.5%, as compared to 22.5% in the prior year, due primarily to the non-recurrence of a $9.1 million pretax charge for warranty expense in 2013.  the resulting operating margin was 29.9% in the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 28.6% in the year ended december 31, 2013.
in our energy systems & controls segment, net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by $40 million or 6% over the year ended december 31, 2013.  organic sales increased by 5% due to sales of new instruments for refinery applications and increased sales in the fluid properties testing equipment market.  gross margin was 58.3% in the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 57.4% in the year ended december 31, 2013, due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales were 28.9% as compared to 29.2% in the prior year due to product mix. operating margin was 29.3% in the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 28.2% in the year ended december 31, 2013.

corporate expenses increased by $12.1 million to $98.2 million, or 2.8% of sales, in 2014 as compared to $86.1 million, or 2.7% of sales, in 2013. the increase was due to higher compensation costs, including increased equity compensation (see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report).
interest expense decreased $9.4 million, or 10.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.  the decrease is due primarily to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates throughout 2014.
other income of $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 was composed of royalty income and foreign exchange gains at our non-u.s. based companies, offset in part by losses from asset disposals.  other expense for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $0.2 million due to foreign exchange losses at our non-u.s. based companies, offset in part by proceeds from a legal settlement.
during 2014, our effective income tax rate was 29.9% versus 28.6% in 2013. the increase was due to one-time discrete tax benefits in 2013 that did not recur in 2014  as well as increased revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the u.s.
at december 31, 2014, the functional currencies of most of our non-u.s. subsidiaries were weaker against the u.s. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31, 2013. the net result of these changes led to a pre-tax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $118.9 million in the year ended december 31, 2014. approximately $50.5 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. for the entire year of 2014, operating profit decreased by less than 1% due to fluctuations in non-u.s. currencies.

operating activities - the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was primarily due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions and the collection of $49 million of receivables due from the puerto rico highways and transportation authority, offset in part by higher deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products.  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was primarily due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions offset in part by tax payments.
investing activities - cash used in investing activities during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was primarily for business acquisitions.  cash received from investing activities in 2015 was primarily proceeds from the sale of the abel pumps business.
financing activities - cash used in financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments as well as dividends paid to stockholders.  cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily from the issuance of $900 million of senior notes and revolving debt borrowings for acquisitions. cash provided by financing activities during 2014 was primarily revolving debt borrowing for acquisitions, offset in part by debt payments made using cash from operations.
net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $126 million at december 31, 2015 compared to $285 million at december 31, 2014, due primarily to a net reduction in net working capital of $50 million due to the reclassification of current deferred tax assets and liabilities (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) and a $49 million decrease in receivables related to the collection of amounts due from the puerto rico highways and transportation authority. we acquired negative net working capital of $13 million through business acquisitions during 2015.  the negative acquired working capital was due primarily to $69 million in deferred revenue balances.
total debt was $3.3 billion at december 31, 2015 (38.3% of total capital) compared to $2.2 billion at december 31, 2014 (31.8% of total capital). our increased debt at december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014 was due to debt borrowings for 2015 acquisitions.
on december 7, 2015, we completed a public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% senior unsecured notes due december 15, 2020, issued at 99.962% of their principal amount, and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85% senior unsecured notes due december 15, 2025, issued at 99.362% of their principal amount.  net proceeds of $894 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under our $1.85 billion revolving credit facility. the senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank senior in right of payment with all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. the notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. the notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.00% and 3.85% per year, respectively, payable semi-annually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year, beginning june 15, 2016.
we may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to u.s. treasury securities.
at december 31, 2015, we had $3.1 billion of senior unsecured notes, $180 million of outstanding revolver borrowings and $4 million of senior subordinated convertible notes. in addition, we had $4 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-u.s. businesses. we had $43 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31, 2015, of which $39 million was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.
we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.
see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding our credit facility, senior notes and senior subordinated convertible notes.
24
cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2015 totaled $688 million.  repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes.  we consider this cash to be permanently reinvested.  we expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by our u.s. operations, our unsecured credit facility, as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the u.s. for the foreseeable future.
capital expenditures of $36.3 million, $37.6 million and $42.5 million were incurred during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales.

1    we have excluded $26 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term portion of the liability. see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.

as of december 31, 2015, we had $505 million of outstanding surety bonds. certain contracts, primarily those involving public sector customers, require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations.
we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources.
we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. however, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2016 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. none of these factors can be predicted with certainty.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

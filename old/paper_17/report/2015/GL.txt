item 1a. risk factors risks related to our business product marketplace and operational risks:
the insurance industry is a regulated industry, populated by many firms. we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks.
the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. as our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance, and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and globe life direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical. adequate compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical. in globe life direct response, continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits.
economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. we serve primarily the middle-income market for individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer's disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited, as a result of a significant, sustained economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under investment risks below.
variations in expected to actual rates of mortality, morbidity, and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity, and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could require policy obligations to be increased and negatively affect our profit margins and income.
a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer's ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies.
rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could potentially have a negative effect on our operations, by limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries, or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries.
ratings reflect only the rating agency's views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company's control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated
6
index to financial statements company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models could impact the rating agencies' judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
reputational risk:
damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business. negative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media, and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products, and the persistency of our block of inforce policies.
life insurance marketplace risk:
our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via globe life direct response solicitation. deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public's receptivity to unsolicited globe life direct response marketing could negatively affect this business.
health insurance marketplace risks:
the health insurance market is subject to substantial legislative scrutiny. legislative changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health businesses. the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business.
competition in the health market can be significant. sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers, such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors. in addition, some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or under price new sales in order to gain market share. we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms. accordingly, changes in the competitive landscape, including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors, could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products.
an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability.
investment risks:
our investments are subject to market and credit risks. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixed-maturity and short-term investments. a significant portion of our fixed-maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer, and other factors beyond our control. additionally, because the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant
7
index to financial statements unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders' equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income.
difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. a default by an issuer could result in a significant other-than-temporary impairment of that investment, causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income. the risk of default is higher for bonds with longer-term maturities, which we acquire in order to match our long-term insurance obligations. we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment. we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. significant downgrades of issuers could negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios, leading to potential downgrades by our rating agencies, potential reduction in future dividend capacity, and/or higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required. material other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower risk-based capital ratios, potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. while we intend to hold our investments until maturity, a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments, resulting in substantial realized losses from the write downs of impaired investments. current net income would be negatively impacted by the write downs, and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income.
declines in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates.
liquidity risks:
our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity also include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing, and reinsurance.
the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries' liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments, and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income, excluding capital gains, on an annual noncumulative basis or 10% of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval. accordingly, impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries' operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow.
we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain
8
index to financial statements the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability, and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock.
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. should credit spreads widen in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business.
in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. therefore, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets.
regulatory risks:
our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our investors. state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. should these changes to our business occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority's interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines.
we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. these actions can result in substantial fines, penalties, or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulatory authority's interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow, impact regulatory capital requirements, or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business.
currently, the u.s. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. however, the dodd-frank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 has established a federal insurance office (fio) within the
9
index to financial statements department of the treasury, and the affordable care act and a financial stability oversight council (fsoc) created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight (cciio), originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms). the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry. we cannot predict what impact, if any, the fio, fsoc and cciio, as well as any other proposals for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products it offers, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, or negatively affect our ability to sell some of our products.
changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may affect our financial statements, reduce our reported profitability, and change the timing of profit recognition. our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (gaap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability.
if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba) and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief.
litigation risk:
litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers' sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit.
our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects.
10
index to financial statements catastrophic event risk:
our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity, caused by events such as a pandemic, hurricane, earthquake, or man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or war, which may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition.
information security and technology risk:
a security breach, the introduction of malware in our computing environment, employee error or malfeasance, unauthorized access, a natural or man-made disaster, or other unanticipated event could compromise the information security systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries, and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
a failure in our information security systems could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation, loss of cash flow and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively. in some cases we may not become aware of such incident for some time after it occurs, which could increase our exposure.
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could access, view, misappropriate, alter or delete confidential information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information. in addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of their information. any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, result in the loss of existing customers, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses.
in the event of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and if existing contingency plans cannot function as designed.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
results of operations how torchmark views its operations: torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life, and supplemental health insurance to middle income households throughout the united states. we view our operations by segments, which are the insurance product lines of life, health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment.
insurance product line segments. as fully explained in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the insurance product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and the administration of policies. each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:
premium revenue less:
policy obligations policy acquisition costs and commissions investment segment. the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:
net investment income less:

torchmark's operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.
summary of operations: net income was $527 million in 2015, compared with $543 million in 2014. net income increased in 2014 from $528 million in 2013. on a diluted per share basis, 2015 net income rose 2% to $4.16 after an 8% increase in 2014. net income per diluted share in 2014 rose to $4.09 from $3.79 in 2013. the per-share results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program. also, each year's per share net income was affected by realized investment gains, which were $(0.05), $0.12, and $0.03, in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses in this report where there is a more complete discussion. also, as explained in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. additionally, we do not consider non-operating items which are not related to the current ongoing reporting performance of our segments to be part of our segment operating income.
management has committed to a plan to sell the medicare part d business in 2016. torchmark no longer emphasizes its medicare part d business due to declining margins, increased risks, higher drug costs, and increased administrative and compliance costs. management believes this sale will allow the company to better focus on its core protection life and health insurance businesses as well as provide additional capital to invest. the medicare part d business met the criteria for discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, and as such, the business is reflected as discontinued operations in the financial statements. as this business has been classified as held for sale and its operations are discontinued, the financial results of this business are excluded from torchmark's continuing operations. for more information, refer to note 6-discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
as shown in the above chart, after-tax segment results of continuing operations rose each year over the prior year from $509 million in 2013 to $520 million in 2014 to $523 million in 2015. the primary contributor to the growth in both 2015 and 2014 was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment, in which margins rose $13 million in 2015 and $11 million in 2014. the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings
17
index to financial statements in each year presented. also contributing to growth in income in both years was our health insurance segment, which provided $5 million of additional margin in 2015 and $3 million in 2014.
excess investment income, the measure of profitability of our investment segment, decreased to $220 million or 2% from the prior year amount of $224 million. in 2014, excess investment income increased 3%. although interest rates increased slightly in 2015, the low interest rate environment continued to pressure investment yields and spreads related to required interest on net policy liabilities throughout the three-year period. excess investment income has also been hampered by a lag in government reimbursements of medicare part d costs. the impact of the lost investment income from delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting rules. as noted previously, the medicare part d business has been classified as discontinued operations. in 2015 and 2014, the timing of cash flows in the medicare part d business had a negative impact on excess investment income, pre-tax of approximately $8 million and $5 million, respectively.
total revenues rose 4% in 2015 to $3.8 billion, or $146 million over the prior year total of $3.6 billion. life premium rose 5% or $107 million in 2015 to $2.1 billion. life premium increased $81 million in 2014 to $2.0 billion. net investment income rose $24 million or 3% in 2014, and rose 2% or $16 million in 2015. health premium increased 6% to $926 million in 2015 and contributed $56 million to 2015 revenue growth, after having gained 1% to $869 million in 2014. health premium contributed $6 million to 2014 revenue growth.
life insurance premium and underwriting margins have grown steadily in each of the three years ended december 31, 2015. the increase in life premium was driven by sales growth and improvements in persistency. while premium and underwriting margins grew, margin as a percent of premium fell slightly in 2015 to 27%, after decreasing from 29% to 28% from 2013 to 2014. these fluctuations were due primarily to higher than expected claims. net life sales increased 9% in 2015 to $412 million after increasing 12% in 2014. the life insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance.
with regard to health insurance, we primarily market medicare supplement insurance and limited-benefit products including critical illness and accident products. in 2013 and 2014, the limited-benefit health premiums have exceeded the medicare supplement premiums due to the inclusion of family heritage at the end of 2012. in late 2014, we experienced an unusually large volume of group sales of our medicare supplement product. as a result of increased growth in group sales, the medicare supplement premiums increased $43 million, which exceeded the limit-benefit premiums. health insurance premium income increased 6% to $926 million in 2015. health net sales fell 13% to $156 million during 2015, as a result of a 29% decrease in medicare supplement sales. first-year collected health premium rose 32% to $157 million from the prior year total of $119 million. the decrease in 2015 health net sales and increase in 2015 first-year collected premium was reflective of the previously mentioned large volume of group sales in 2014. health margins declined to 22%, with underwriting income increasing to $204 million for 2015. margins were $199 million for the same period in 2014. the 2015 change was due to lower pricing margins on the group business sold in 2014.
we do not currently market annuities. see the caption annuities for discussion of the annuity segment.
the investment segment's pretax profitability, or excess investment income, is based on three major components: net investment income, required interest on net policy liabilities (interest applicable to insurance products), and financing costs. in 2015, net investment income rose 2%, compared with 3% in 2014. at the same time, our investment portfolio grew 3% in both 2015 and 2014. in recent years, net investment income has not grown as fast as the portfolio due to new investments being made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. also, there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested, during which the funds are held in cash. growth in total investment income is also somewhat negatively affected by torchmark's share repurchase program (described later under this caption), which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments. in 2015 and 2014, net investment income was negatively impacted by our medicare part d business. under the program, we are required to cover certain claim costs in the current period that are the federal government's responsibility, but are not reimbursed until late in the next calendar year. this delay in reimbursement reduced our funds available for investment in 2015 and 2014, resulting in reduced investment income in both periods.
the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income, and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets. the lower new-money yields resulting from the
18
index to financial statements low-interest-rate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow at approximately the same rate that net policy liabilities have grown. financing costs, which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short-term debt, are also deducted from net investment income. financing costs in 2015 were up slightly to $77 million from $76 million in 2014. this increase was primarily the result of increased short term borrowings coupled with slightly higher short term interest rates. the 2014 decline resulted from the maturity and repayment in 2013 of our $94.5 million principal amount 7.375% notes.
torchmark's current investment policy regarding fixed maturities limits new fixed maturity acquisitions to investment-grade securities generally with longer maturities (often exceeding twenty years) that meet our quality and yield objectives. approximately 96% of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which 96% were investment grade at december 31, 2015. the average quality rating of the portfolio was a-. the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alt-a mortgages, no direct investment in residential mortgages, no credit default swaps, or other derivative contracts. see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and note 4-investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this segment.
insurance administrative expenses were up 6.5% in 2015 when compared with the prior year period. the primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology and employee costs, including pension-related costs. stock compensation expense declined $4 million in 2015 to $28.7 million compared with an increase of $7 million in 2014 to $32.2 million. the decline in stock compensation expense in 2015 resulted primarily from lower expense associated with performance shares as well as lower option values on 2015 option awards.
in each of the years 2013 through 2015, net income was affected by certain significant, unusual, and nonrecurring nonoperating items. we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. accordingly, as described in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods.
torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986. with no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company's excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow. additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. the board of directors has authorized the company's share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the board, determines to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the last three years.

index to financial statements a discussion of each of torchmark's segments follows. the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
life insurance. life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with 2015 life premium representing 69% of total premium. life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 73% of the total in 2015. additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.
life insurance premium rose 5% to $2.1 billion in 2015 after having increased 4% in 2014 to $2.0 billion. life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows:

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: "annualized premium in force," "net sales," and "first-year collected premium." annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. net sales is annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of globe life direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued. first-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. first-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.
annualized life premium in force was $2.15 billion at december 31, 2015, an increase of 5% over $2.04 billion a year earlier. annualized life premium in force was $1.96 billion at december 31, 2013.

the american income exclusive agency has historically marketed primarily to members of labor unions. while labor unions are still the core market for this agency, american income has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help ensure sustainable growth. the life business of this agency is torchmark's highest-margin life business and it is the largest contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at 40% of torchmark's 2015 total. this group produced premium income of $831 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year total of $766 million, after having risen 7% in 2014. first-year collected premium was $156 million compared to $134 million in 2014, an increase of 16%. first-year collected premium rose 5% in 2014. net sales increased 15% to $198 million in 2015 over the 2014 total of $172 million. net sales increased 13% in 2014 over the 2013 total of $153 million. sales growth in our captive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force. the american income agency's average agent count rose 11% to 6,529 for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared with 5,868 for the same period in 2014. the average agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the period. the american income agency has been focusing on growing and strengthening middle management to support sustainable growth of the agency force. to accomplish this, we have placed an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train personnel. the agency continues to provide more home-office and webinar training programs. these programs are designed to provide each agent, from new recruits to top level managers, coaching and instruction specifically designed for each individual's level of experience and responsibility.
the globe life direct response unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing approaches, which include direct mailings, insert media, and electronic media. these different approaches support and complement one another in the unit's efforts to reach the consumer. the globe life direct response channel's growth has been fueled by constant innovation. in recent years, electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology, and
21

while the juvenile market is an important source of sales, it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders, who are more likely to respond favorably to a globe life direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. also, both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time.

life insurance underwriting income before insurance administrative expense was $569 million in 2015 compared with $556 million in 2014 and $545 million in 2013. as a percentage of premium, underwriting margins declined to 27% in 2015 from 28% in 2014. the decrease in underwriting margin as a percentage of premium in 2015 and 2014 was due primarily to higher than expected globe life direct response policy obligations and to increases in non-deferred acquisition costs in the globe life direct response and american income units. non-deferred acquisition expense

index to financial statements increased primarily as a result of additional investments made to support our distribution channels which are expected to result in increased sales and premium income in future periods. the higher than expected claims in the globe life direct response unit primarily relate to policies issued since 2011 where prescription information was used in the underwriting process for certain policies in order to improve the overall mortality of the policies written. to date, improvements in the actual mortality on such policies have been less than expected, causing an increase in our net policy obligations.
health insurance. health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement insurance, critical illness coverage, accident coverage, and other limited-benefit supplemental health products. in this analysis, all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement are classified as limited-benefit plans.
health premium accounted for 31% of our total premium in 2015, while the health underwriting margin accounted for 26% of total underwriting margin, reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percent of premium for health compared with life insurance. as noted under the caption life insurance, we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health, due to life's superior profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income.

health premium increased 6% to $926 million in 2015 compared with $869 million in 2014 after an increase of 1% in 2014 over the 2013 total of $864 million. medicare supplement premium increased 10% to $466 million, while other limited-benefit health premium increased 3% to $459 million.
health net sales declined 13% to $156 million in 2015 from $181 million in 2014. net sales in 2013 totaled $111 million. medicare supplement net sales decreased 29% to $76 million in 2015. a decrease in 2015 medicare supplement net sales was expected due to the unusually high level of group sales and individual sales in late 2014. group sales can vary significantly from period to period due to the impact of large groups that can occur from time to time. limited-benefit net sales increased 8% to $81 million. health first-year collected premium rose 32% to $157 million due to the aforementioned high level of group sales in 2014. health first-year collected premium was up 18% during 2014. first year medicare supplement premium was up 53% as a result of an increase in the ua independent agency individual sales and the 2014 group sales noted above. as a result of the medicare supplement sales activity occurring in the fourth quarter, the full impact of this activity on collected premium is seen in the following year.

index to financial statements we do not expect recent health care reform activity to have a significant impact on our operations. the affordable care act (aca) imposes an annual fee to health insurance issuers offering commercial health insurance as well as another fee for premium stabilization. these taxes totaled $1.2 million and $1.8 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the ua independent agency consists of independent agencies appointed with torchmark who may also sell for other companies. the ua independent agency was torchmark's largest health agency in terms of health premium income. in 2015, premium income was $345 million, representing 37% of torchmark's total health premium. net sales were $72 million, or 46% of torchmark's health sales. this agency is torchmark's largest producer of medicare supplement insurance, with medicare supplement premium income of $330 million. the ua independent agency represents approximately 71% of all torchmark medicare supplement premium and 93% of medicare supplement net sales. medicare supplement premium in this agency rose 15%. total health premium increased 13% in 2015 and 2% in 2014. medicare supplement net sales decreased 15% in 2015 from prior year. individual sales were up 36% due to the high volume of sales in late 2014 and 2015. as previously discussed, group sales significantly increased in late 2014 resulting in a 42% decline in the current year, which is consistent with historical fluctuation from period to period.
the family heritage exclusive agency primarily markets limited-benefit supplemental health insurance in non-urban areas. most of their policies include a cash-back feature, such as a return of premium whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy. management expects to grow this agency through geographic expansion and continuing incorporation of torchmark's recruiting programs. the family heritage agency contributed $50 million in net sales in 2015, compared with $47 million in 2014 and $44 million in 2013. health premium income was $221 million in 2015, representing 24% of torchmark's health premium. this compared with $205 million or 24% of health premium in 2014 and $191 million or 22% in 2013. the average agent count was 882 for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with 740 for the same period in 2014, an increase of 19%.
the liberty national exclusive agency represented 23% of all torchmark health premium income at $209 million in 2015. the liberty agency markets limited-benefit supplemental health products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance. much of liberty's health business is now generated through work site marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees. in 2015, health premium income in the agency declined 6% from prior year premium of $222 million after declining 8% during 2014. liberty's health premium decline has been due primarily to its declining medicare supplement block.
other distribution. certain of our other distribution channels market health products, although their main emphasis is on life insurance. on a combined basis, they accounted for 16% of health premium in 2015. the american income exclusive agency primarily markets accident plans. the direct response group markets primarily medicare supplements to employer or union-sponsored groups. direct response added $5 million of medicare supplement net sales in 2015 compared with $23 million in 2014. the higher net sales in 2014 were due to the addition of a large new group in the third quarter of 2014.
as presented in the following table, torchmark's health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense increased 3% to $204 million in 2015, after an increase of 1% to $199 million in 2014. as a percentage of health premium, margins were down slightly to 22% in 2015, due to increased benefit ratios in the direct response and ua channels. the group business sold in 2014 was priced at higher benefit ratios.

annuities. our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $1.32 billion, $1.36 billion, and $1.38 billion, respectively. underwriting income was $4.6 million, $4.3 million, and $3.9 million in each of the respective years.
while the fixed annuity account balance has been declining slightly year over year, underwriting income has increased each year over the prior year. policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year. the majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are based on a function of account size and time lapsed since deposit. a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which can result in negative net policy obligations. in the three-year period, however, spreads tended to level as crediting rates reached guaranteed minimums.
we do not currently market annuity products, favoring instead protection-oriented life and health insurance products. therefore, we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward.

insurance administrative expenses were up 6.5% in 2015 when compared with the prior year after declining slightly during 2014. as a percentage of total premium, insurance administrative expenses were flat during 2015 when compared to 2014 at 6.2% and down when compared to 2013 which stood at 6.4%. total operating expenses increased 2.9%, consistent with the 2014 increase over 2013. the primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology and employee costs, including pension-related costs. the decline in stock compensation expense is primarily due to lower expense associated with performance share awards and lower option values on the 2015 grants. the decline in legal settlement expense was attributable to certain legal and administrative settlements that occurred in 2014. as described in note 14-business segments in the notes on the consolidated financial statements, we recorded legal accruals involving non-insurance matters, partially offset by proceeds for investment litigation. litigation not related to our direct insurance operations is not considered an insurance administrative expense by torchmark management and is removed from its analysis of core insurance operations in its segment reporting.

index to financial statements investments. we manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or "financing costs."
we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company. since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used over $6.5 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.

excess investment income decreased $5 million or 2% in 2015 over the prior year. excess investment income increased $6 million or 3% in 2014. excess investment income has been pressured over the past three years as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on net investment income coupled with the increase in required interest on net policy liabilities discussed later under this caption. on a per diluted share basis, excess investment income increased 2% to $1.73 in 2015. excess investment income increased 8% to $1.69 per share in 2014, after having declined 3% in the prior year. the significant increase in the 2014 per share amount over 2013 and the increase in the 2015 per share amount over 2014, versus the decrease in dollar amount of excess investment income, is a result of the share repurchase program.
the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, which rose 2% to $774 million in 2015. it increased 3% to $758 million in 2014 from $735 million in 2013. growth in net investment income has generally been slower than growth in mean invested assets in recent years due to the declining interest rate environment. in 2015, fixed maturity yields averaged 5.84% on a tax-equivalent and effective-yield basis, compared with 5.91% in 2014 and 5.94% in 2013. even though mean invested assets have increased each period, net investment income has grown at a slower pace as a result of the decline in average yields. the overall average portfolio yield decreased in the 2013
29
index to financial statements to 2015 periods as new money is being invested at lower prevailing yields, and from the result of reinvesting proceeds from bonds that matured or were called at yield rates less than the rates we earned on the bonds before they matured or were called. a significant amount of calls were a negative factor on net investment income in 2013, but calls and maturities were very limited in their affect in 2014 and 2015. during 2014 and 2015, the proceeds from all dispositions have been reinvested at yield rates closer to the yield rates on the disposed assets.
net investment income has also been negatively affected in 2014 and 2015 by the cms requirement for us to pay certain medicare part d claims costs during the current period that are ultimately the responsibility of the government, but are not reimbursed until the following year. because of the overall design of the program and higher part d claims due to the approval of new hepatitis c drugs and higher overall drug costs, we have incurred extensive upfront costs that are not reimbursed by cms until late in the following respective year. these delays in reimbursements have caused a delay in cash flows available for new investments that resulted in a loss of approximately $5 million and $8 million of pre-tax net investment income in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and will cause us to lose approximately $9 million of additional investment income in 2016.
presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets.
2015                                                                2014        2013
growth in net investment income                      2.1   %     3.2   %     2.6   %
growth in mean invested assets (at amortized cost)   3.2   %     3.4   %     9.3   %
while net investment income in recent years has been negatively impacted by the factors discussed above, we would expect to see only modest declines in the average portfolio yield rate over the next few years. we anticipate that less than 2% of fixed maturities on average are expected to run off each year over the next five years and the average yield rate on assets acquired with the proceeds of dispositions is not expected to be significantly less than the yield rate earned on the assets prior to their disposal. accordingly, we believe it is unlikely that dispositions will have a significant negative impact on net investment income and the growth rate of net investment income in the next few years.
required interest on net insurance policy liabilities reduces net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to "fund" the required interest included in the insurance segments. as such, it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments. as discussed in note 14-business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, management believes this provides a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments. required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force. the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest-rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be "locked in" for the life of that block of business. each calendar year, we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year. that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year, and cannot be changed. the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in. as such, the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business. business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weighted-average discount rate due to the size of our in force business.
because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business, benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs. due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weighted-average discount rate of our in force block, we don't expect an extended low-interest-rate environment to cause a loss recognition event.

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. the table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations.

financing costs                 $76,642             $76,126             $80,461
financing costs increased slightly from 2014 to 2015. the decrease of $4 million or 5% in 2014 was related to the maturity and repayment of our $94 million par amount 7.375% notes during the third quarter of 2013. in 2015, interest on short-term debt increased primarily because of the increase in the weighted-average interest rate and the average balance on short-term debt. more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial condition section of this report and in note 11-debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
as previously noted, growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs as has been the case in recent years. in an extended low-interest-rate environment, the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower long-term rates. we believe, however, the decline would be relatively slow as on average less than 2% of fixed maturities are expected to run off each year over the next five years.
31
index to financial statements in response to the lower interest rates, we raised the premium rates for new business on major life products in early 2012 and again in late 2013. the increased premium provides additional margin on these policies to help offset higher mandatory cash values and the possible future reductions in excess investment income. despite these increases in premium rates, we have continued to see growth in net sales.
excess investment income benefits from increases in long-term rates available on new investments and decreases in short-term borrowing rates. of these two factors, higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short-term rates. therefore, torchmark would benefit if rates, especially long-term rates, were to rise.
investment acquisitions. torchmark's investment policy calls for investing in fixed maturities that are investment grade and meet our quality and yield objectives. we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. we believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable. if longer-term securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available, we do not relax our quality objectives, but instead, consider investing in shorter term or lower yielding securities, taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors.
during calendar years 2013 through 2015, torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities, primarily in corporate bonds with longer-term maturities. the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases for the last three years. the effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield, commonly referred to as the "worst call date." for non-callable bonds, the worst-call date is always the maturity date. for callable bonds, the worst-call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield, typically the first call date.

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. for investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment. however absent sales, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.
during the three years 2013 through 2015, acquisitions consisted of securities spanning a diversified range of issuers, industry sectors, and geographical regions. all of the acquired securities were investment grade. in addition to the fixed maturity acquisitions, torchmark invested $30 million in a limited partnership in 2015. the limited partnership is a diversified investment fund that currently invests opportunistically in global credit assets with the potential for attractive returns relative to risk. it is classified within long-term investments.
32
index to financial statements new cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations and coupons received on existing investments. in some years, a significant amount of new investments can be derived from proceeds from dispositions including issuer calls. issuer calls, as a result of the low-interest environment experienced during the past three years were an important factor, especially in 2013. calls increase funds available for investment, but as noted earlier in this discussion, they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than those of the bonds that were called. issuer calls were $178 million in 2015, $160 million in 2014, and $344 million in 2013. the higher level of acquisitions in 2013 was primarily due to the additional funds available from the higher level of 2013 calls. the lower level of acquisitions in 2014 was primarily due to the delay in receiving cms reimbursements as discussed earlier.

approximately 96% of our investments at book value are in a diversified fixed maturity portfolio. policy loans, which are secured by policy cash values, make up approximately 4% of our investments. we also have insignificant investments in equity securities and other long-term investments. because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio, the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities.

index to financial statements at december 31, 2015, fixed maturities had a fair value of $13.8 billion, compared with $14.5 billion at december 31, 2014. the net unrealized gain position in the fixed maturity portfolio decreased from $1.7 billion at december 31, 2014 to $506 million at december 31, 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in market interest rates. the december 31, 2015 net unrealized gain consisted of gross unrealized gains of $1.1 billion offset by $564 million of gross unrealized losses, compared with the december 31, 2014 net unrealized gain which consisted of a gross unrealized gain of $1.7 billion and a gross unrealized loss of $79 million. as described in note 4-investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the increase in gross unrealized losses was partially attributable to rising interest rates in the financial markets, but also resulted from deteriorating conditions in the energy and metals and mining sectors.
corporate securities are diversified over a variety of industry sectors and issuers.the total fixed maturity portfolio consists of 563 issuers, with 205 issuers within the financial, utility, and energy sectors.
financial and utilities. at december 31, 2015, the fixed maturity securities in the financial and utility sectors had net unrealized gains of $288 million and $196 million, respectively. less than 6% of the book value of the holdings in each of these sectors was rated below-investment grade. while the fair market value of the securities in these two sectors declined during the year, torchmark does not believe that its fixed maturity securities in the financial and utility sectors pose a significant credit risk in the foreseeable future or that any of these securities are other-than-temporarily impaired.
energy and basic materials. the current low price of oil and other commodities is putting some downward price pressure on some of our holdings in the energy and basic materials sectors, resulting in lower fair values of these sectors as noted above. our energy sector investments accounted for 12% of fixed maturities at amortized cost and 10% of fixed maturities at fair value as of december 31, 2015. at amortized cost, over 93% of the energy holdings are investment grade. within our energy portfolio, 53% of the holdings at amortized cost are in pipelines, 34% are in exploration and production, 6% are in oil field services, and the remainder are in refineries and drilling. we believe securities in drilling and oil field services with an amortized cost of $44 million rated below investment grade have the greatest risk of exposure to the current market conditions. our investments in basic materials accounted for 8% of fixed maturities at amortized cost and 7% of fixed maturities at fair value as of december 31, 2015. at amortized cost, over 95% of these holdings are investment grade. within this sector, 49% of the holdings at amortized cost are in chemicals, 40% are in mining, and the remainder are in forestry products.
while a sustained period of low oil and natural gas prices and depressed demand for commodities may lead to some downgrades in these sectors, we believe that our investments will be able to withstand lower energy and commodity prices for an extended duration. due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by our insurance products, torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery. even though these fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale, torchmark generally intends to hold to maturity any securities which are temporarily impaired. as of december 31, 2015, torchmark does not believe that any of its holdings in the energy and basic materials sectors are other-than-temporarily impaired.
for more information about our fixed maturity portfolio by component at december 31, 2015 and 2014, including a discussion of other-than-temporary impairments, an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities, see note 4-investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
an analysis of the fixed maturity portfolio by a composite rating at december 31, 2015 is shown in the following table. the composite rating for each security, other than private-placement securities managed by third parties, is the average of the security's ratings as assigned by moody's investor service, standard & poor's, fitch ratings, and dominion bond rating service, ltd. the ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average. included in the chart below are private placement fixed maturity holdings of $542 million at amortized cost ($546 million at fair value) for which the ratings were assigned by the third party managers.

of the $13.3 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost as of december 31, 2015, $12.6 billion or 95% were investment grade with an average rating of a-. below-investment-grade bonds were $640 million with an average rating of b+. below-investment-grade bonds at amortized cost were 17% of our shareholders' equity, excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities as of december 31, 2015. overall, the total portfolio had a weighted average quality rating of a- based on amortized cost, the same as at the end of 2014.
an analysis of changes in our portfolio of below-investment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows:

our investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings. our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub-prime or alt-a mortgages (loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). we have no direct investments in residential mortgages and we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. we do not participate in securities lending, we have no off-balance sheet investments, and we have only an insignificant exposure to european sovereign debt consisting of $2 million in german government bonds at december 31, 2015. our exposure to puerto rican obligations is insignificant.

index to financial statements market risk sensitivity. torchmark's investment securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company's investment portfolio. since 96% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value. under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and the intent to hold these investments to maturity. the long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. however, as is permitted by gaap, these liabilities are not recorded at fair value.
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed-maturity portfolio at december 31, 2015 and 2014. this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates (as represented by the u.s. treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.

realized gains and losses. our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. in addition to the payment of these benefits, we also incur acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes as a part of insurance operations. because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. for this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. this portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. as a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.
investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally, usually as the result of bonds sold because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. investment losses are also caused by write downs due to impairments. we do not engage in trading investments for profit. therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period-to-period trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations. accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. for these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.

as described in note 4-investments under the caption other-than-temporary impairments, we have not incurred any write downs in our fixed maturity portfolio as a result of other-than-temporary impairment for the years 2013 through 2015. during 2013, we sold investment real estate for an after-tax loss of $1.9 million, of which $1.7 million had been written down due to other-than-temporary impairment earlier in that year.
financial condition liquidity. liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.
insurance subsidiary liquidity. the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. the funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. in addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries' operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company, subject to regulatory restriction. the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries' prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. while the leading source of the excess cash is investment income, due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control, a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income.
parent company liquidity. cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt, operating expenses of the parent, and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders. in 2015, the parent received $466 million of cash dividends from its subsidiaries, compared with $479 million in 2014 and $488 million in 2013. including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in 2015 of approximately $358 million, compared with $377 million in 2014 and $364 million in 2013. parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as insurance subsidiary capital or financing needs, strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. in 2016, it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately $450 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries and that approximately $320 to $330 million will be available as excess cash flow. certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends. for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of note 12-shareholders' equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements. although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company.
38
index to financial statements short-term borrowings. an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $750 million. in july 2014, torchmark replaced a $600 million facility with this agreement, as discussed in note 11-debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements, under the caption commercial paper. the facility, like the previous, is further designated as a back-up line of credit for a commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2015, we had available $332 million of additional borrowing capacity under this new facility, compared with $314 million a year earlier. there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended december 31, 2015.
in summary, torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2016 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt, additional borrowings on our short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.
consolidated liquidity. consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were $1.1 billion in 2015, compared with $880 million in 2014 and $1.1 billion in 2013. in addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies received proceeds from maturities, calls, and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of $376 million in 2015, compared with $273 million in 2014 and $494 million in 2013.
our cash and short-term investments were $116 million at year-end 2015 and $82 million at year-end 2014. additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. these securities had a fair value of $13.8 billion at december 31, 2015. however, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.
off-balance sheet arrangements. as a part of its aforementioned credit facility, torchmark had outstanding $177 million in stand-by letters of credit at december 31, 2015, compared with $198 million a year earlier. these letters are issued among our subsidiaries, one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer, and have no impact on company obligations as a whole. any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of off-shore captive reinsurers might require torchmark to obtain third-party financing, which could cause an immaterial increase in financing costs.
as of december 31, 2015, we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities. all of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in note 15-commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

(1)   funded debt is itemized in note 11-debt and includes short-term commercial paper.
(2)   interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations.
(3)   pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans. they are offset by invested assets in the trusts, which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the obligations as they become due. therefore, our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on torchmark's consolidated balance sheets. at december 31, 2015, these pension obligations were $477 million, but there were also assets of $308 million in the pension entities. the schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations, except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted. there are also obligations for benefits other than pensions with a liability of $22 million. please refer to note 9-postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pension obligations.
(4)   future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at december 31, 2015. these estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. management believes that the assets supporting the liability of $12.2 billion at december 31, 2015, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.
capital resources. torchmark's capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in note 11-debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the current maturity of funded debt), long-term funded debt, and shareholders' equity. a complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11.
the carrying value of the funded debt was $993 million at december 31, 2015, compared with $992 million a year earlier. torchmark has a 6.375% senior note that matures on june 15, 2016 with a par value and book value of $250 million. as this issue matures within one year, it has been reclassified to short term debt. torchmark intends to refinance the debt during calendar 2016 with a hybrid debt instrument.
our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of 325% of company action level regulatory capital under risk-based capital (rbc), a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. the 325% target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows, the relatively low risk of their product mix, and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark. at december 31, 2015, our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios of approximately 320%. should we experience impairments and/or ratings downgrades within its fixed maturity portfolio in the future, the ratio could fall below targeted levels. in such a case, management believes more than sufficient liquidity exists at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the targeted ratio.
as noted under the caption summary of operations in this report, we have an ongoing share repurchase program. under this program, we acquired 6 million shares at a cost of $359 million in 2015, 7 million shares at a cost of $375 million in 2014, and 8 million shares for $360 million in 2013. the majority of purchased shares are retired each
40
index to financial statements year. please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption summary of operations in this report.
torchmark has continually increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years. in the first quarter of 2013, it was increased to $0.1133 per share from $0.10 per share. in the first quarter of 2014, it was raised to $0.1267 per share. finally, in the first quarter of 2015, dividends were raised to $0.135 per share.
shareholders' equity was $4.1 billion at december 31, 2015, compared with $4.7 billion at december 31, 2014. during the twelve months since december 31, 2014, shareholders' equity was reduced by the $359 million in share purchases under the repurchase program, $60 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises, and $750 million of after-tax unrealized losses in the fixed maturity portfolio. however, it was increased by $527 million of net income.
we plan to use excess cash available at the parent company as efficiently as possible in the future. possible uses of excess cash flow include, but are not limited to share repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in fixed maturities, or repayment of short-term debt. we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies.
we maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders' liabilities. current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. the period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders' equity. changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. while invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders' equity. due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders' equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders' equity. if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders' equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. from time to time, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders' equity. because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. as such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.

(3)   torchmark's debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting rule requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio. this ratio is computed by dividing total debt by the sum of debt and shareholders' equity.
fasb guidance provides for an option which, if elected, would permit us to value our interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. however, unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our available-for-sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income, the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings. because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt, the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile, causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results. therefore, we have not elected this option.
torchmark's ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 11.0 times in 2015, compared with 11.3 times in 2014 and 10.4 times in 2013 (as adjusted for discontinued operations and the adoption of asu 2014-01 investments-equity method and joint ventures: accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects). this times-interest-earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre-tax income from continuing operations and interest expense. a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report.

index to financial statements financial strength ratings. the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by standard & poor's and a. m. best. the following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31, 2015.
standard&amp; poor's   a.m best liberty           aa-                    a+ (superior)

united american   aa-                    a+ (superior)
american income   aa-                    a+ (superior)
family heritage   nr                     a (excellent)
a.m. best states that it assigns an a+ (superior) rating to insurance companies that have, in its opinion, a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations. it assigns an a (excellent) rating to insurance companies that have, in its opinion, an excellent ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations.
the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard & poor's corporation (s&p) to those insurers which have very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments which differs from the highest-rated insurers only to a small degree. an insurer rated a has strong capacity to meet its financial commitments but it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than insurers in higher-rated categories. the plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category.
in the third quarter of 2014, standard and poor's (s&p) revised its outlook on torchmark's capital position to a negative outlook. that updated outlook was due to s&p's view at that time at certain internal components of torchmark's capital position rather than a change in the capital position itself. however, during the fourth quarter of 2015, s&p formally reviewed our operations and financial outlook. based on their review, they revised their outlook from negative to stable and confirmed our "aa-" financial strength ratings at our insurance subsidiaries and torchmark corporation's senior debt "a" credit rating. we intend to maintain adequate capital levels for s&p and any changes to our capital position to maintain such levels are not expected to have any significant impact on our share repurchase program or our financial results in future periods.
other items litigation. torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded. this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. for more information concerning litigation, please refer to note 15-commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

index to financial statements critical accounting policies future policy benefits: due to the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1-significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
approximately 85% of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31, 2015 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. these assumptions are "locked in" and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in note 1-significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits. otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december 31, 2015.
the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business.
deferred acquisition costs: certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset. deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note 1-significant accounting policies under the caption deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements. additionally, the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies, known as the value of insurance purchased, is included in deferred acquisition costs. our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1.
approximately 99% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31, 2015 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. these assumptions are "locked-in" at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31, 2015.
the remaining 1% of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. these contracts are not subject to lock-in. the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31, 2015.
policy claims and other benefits payable: this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. however, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. however, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. at this time, we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.
valuation of fixed maturities: we hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. while these securities are generally expected to
44
index to financial statements be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to manage risk. we report this portfolio at fair value. fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company. this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report. however, as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.
at times, the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets. illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable. even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed-maturity investments is presented in note 1-significant accounting policies and in note 4-investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the captions fair value measurements in both notes.
impairment of investments: we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value and that have become impaired in value. while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary. the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1-significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report. while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.
defined benefit pension plans: we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. in accordance with gaap, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. these obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. at december 31, 2015, our gross liability under these funded plans was $477 million, but was offset by assets of $308 million.
45
index to financial statements the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans. for example, a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2015 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2015.

(1)   the discount rate was 4.23% for 2015 expense and 4.64% for the projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2015.
(2)   the expected return rate assumed was 6.96%.
the company determines mortality assumptions through the use of published mortality tables that reflect broad-based studies of mortality and published longevity improvement scales. during 2014, the company revised the mortality assumptions based on an evaluation of a new mortality table and longevity scale released by the society of actuaries. the change in these assumptions added approximately $26 million to the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2014.
the criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in note 9-postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements. while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to us. note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets, investment policies, and other related data.

index to financial statements cautionary statements we caution readers regarding certain forward-looking statements contained in the foregoing discussion and elsewhere in this document, and in any other statements made by us or on our behalf whether or not in future filings with the securities and exchange commission. any statement that is not a historical fact, or that might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning us or our business, whether express or implied, is meant as and should be considered a forward-looking statement. such statements represent our opinions concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments.
forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. if these estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, the actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions. whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments, which may be national in scope, related to the insurance industry generally, or applicable to torchmark specifically. such events or developments could include, but are not necessarily limited to:
1) changes in lapse rates and/or sales of our insurance policies as well as levels of mortality, morbidity and utilization of healthcare services that differ from our assumptions;
2) federal and state legislative and regulatory developments, particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the federal medicare program that would affect medicare supplement and medicare part d insurance;
3) market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (hmos) and other managed care or private plans, and that could affect the sales of traditional medicare supplement insurance;
4) interest rate changes that affect product sales and/or investment portfolio yield;
5) general economic, industry sector or individual debt issuers' financial conditions that may affect the current market value of securities that we own, or that may impair issuers' ability to pay interest due us on those securities;
6) changes in pricing competition;
7) litigation results;
8) levels of administrative and operational efficiencies that differ from our assumptions;
9) our inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for health insurance policies due to regulatory delay;
10) the customer response to new products and marketing initiatives; and
11) reported amounts in the financial statements which are based on our estimates and judgments which may differ from the actual amounts ultimately realized.
readers are also directed to consider other risks and uncertainties described in our other documents on file with the securities and exchange commission.

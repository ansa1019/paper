item 1a.    risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10-k should be considered. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business including its financial performance, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.
risks related to our industry conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business.
our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry. automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending and preferences. economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on our sales to oems.
14
we face strong competition.
we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition. our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources. although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products. these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply. the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional u.s. oem customers, faced with intense international competition, have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components. as a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. increased competition could adversely affect our business.
risks related to our business we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products.
there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs, including costs of products we supply. annual price reductions to oem customers are a permanent component of our business. to maintain our profit margins, we seek price reductions from our suppliers, improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, updated product designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits of which support stable or increased prices. our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited, with cost recovery often less than 100% and often on a delayed basis. inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions, increases in raw material costs, and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business.
we continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products.
the company uses a variety of commodities (including aluminum, copper, nickel, plastic resins, steel, other raw materials and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings and bar stock. increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results. we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material pass-through provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures. customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any material increases. the discontinuation or lessening of our ability to pass-through or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business.
from time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. when this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions. the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers. if these supply interruptions occur, it could adversely affect our business.
we use important intellectual property in our business. if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.
we own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. our competitors may develop
15
technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce these rights, could adversely affect our business and our competitive position.
we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems.
to improve efficiency and reduce costs, we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing, payroll and general management operations. if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled, key business processes could be interrupted, which could adversely affect our business.
a failure of our information technology (it) infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations.
we rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our it systems and infrastructure. it systems are vulnerable to disruptions, including those resulting from natural disasters, cyber-attacks or failures in third-party-provided services. disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our third-party data. as a result, such attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, including our intellectual property, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages. this could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers, lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect our business.
our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide. any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business.
part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately 16% of our u.s. workforce was unionized. we have domestic collective bargaining agreements for one facility in new york, which expires in september 2016, and one facility in oklahoma, which expires in march 2019. the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized. a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business.
we are impacted by the rising cost of providing benefits and certain retirement benefit plans we sponsor are currently unfunded or underfunded.
we sponsor certain retirement benefit plans worldwide that are unfunded or underfunded and will require cash payments. if the performance of the assets in our funded pension plans do not meet our expectations, if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified, our required cash payments may be higher than we expect.
16
we are subject to extensive environmental regulations.
our operations are subject to laws governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result. through various acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. in addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future. costs associated with failure to comply with environmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.
we have liabilities related to environmental, product warranties, litigation and other claims.
we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws.
we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products. under these product warranties, we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. we cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material, or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements.
we are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury, product liability (including claims associated with the presence of asbestos in historical products), environmental and employment claims. there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate. while the company maintains insurance for certain risks, the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities. the incurring of significant liabilities for which there is no, or insufficient, insurance coverage could adversely affect our business.
compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results. in addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.
we have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. compliance related issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws could also adversely affect our business.
changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate. in addition, government disruptions, such as government shutdowns, may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business.
17
changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business.
changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization.
if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters. these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts. we believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable.
our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful.
we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions.
we may not meet our goal because of any of the following, or other factors: (a) the failure to develop new products that will be purchased by our customers; (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete; and (c) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of components.
we expect to continue to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities, enhance our customer base, geographic representation, and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities, some of which could be material. while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our long-term strategy, there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities. assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence. however, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited, and we can give no assurance that past or future business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. the integration of companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. revenues following the acquisition of a company may be lower than expected, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, or suppliers) may be greater than expected and the retention of key employees at the acquired company may not be achieved. we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business.
18
we are subject to risks related to our international operations.
we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including europe, asia, the americas and africa. for 2015, approximately 75% of our consolidated net sales were outside the u.s. consequently, our results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the repatriation of funds, changing economic conditions, unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems, insufficient infrastructures, social unrest, political instability and disputes, and international terrorism. compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging, burdensome and expensive.
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to u.s. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses and capital expenditures. the local currency is the functional currency for substantially all of the company's foreign subsidiaries. significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business.
our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic, political and market conditions.
maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. as the chinese market evolves, we anticipate that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share. increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. in addition, our business in china is sensitive to economic, political and market conditions that drive sales volume in china. if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets.
changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds. if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted.
our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded. the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement. further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.
we could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions.
we have and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness, enhance treasury management flexibility or create an optimal legal entity structure. we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions. failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business.
19
risks related to our customers we rely on sales to major customers.
we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands. supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company. we base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by our customers. these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle. if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including non-renewal of purchase orders, a customer's financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons, it could adversely affect our business.
some of our sales are concentrated. our worldwide sales in 2015 to volkswagen and ford constituted approximately 15% each of our 2015 consolidated net sales.
we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers' labor relations.
all three of our primary north american customers, ford, fiat chrysler automobiles and general motors, have major union contracts with the united automobile, aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america. because of domestic oems' dependence on a single union, we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems' facilities. similarly, a majority of our global customers' operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions. any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business.
risks related to our suppliers we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers.
in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. as a result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products. the company selects suppliers based on total value (including total landed price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition. we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations.
however, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations, labor unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes, government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, cyber attacks, non-conforming parts, acts of terrorism, "acts of god," or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations. this could adversely affect our customer relations and business.
suppliers' economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business.
rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw material, commodity, transportation, and energy price escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with little advanced notice. these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks. in certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business. on occasion, we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines. we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business.
20
we are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers.
the company relies on third party service providers for administration of legal claims, health care benefits, pension benefits, stockholder and bondholder registration and other services. these service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the company's business. insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business.
we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties.
the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts.
other risks a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business.
any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers; start-up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs, utilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others; global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation; and the impact of fire, flood or other natural disasters.

a summary of non-comparable items impacting the company's net earnings for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows:
year ended december 31, 2015:
•   the company incurred restructuring expense of $65.7 million, associated with both the drivetrain and engine segments and a global realignment plan. the drivetrain segment charges mostly represent expenses associated with severance agreements with three labor unions at separate facilities in western europe for approximately 450 employees, as well as restructuring of the 2015 remy international, inc. ("remy") acquisition. the engine segment charges primarily relate to the restructuring of the 2014 gustav wahler gmbh u. co. kg and its general partner ("wahler") acquisition. these expenses included $41.5 million related to employee termination benefits and $11.7 million of other expenses. both the drivetrain and engine restructuring actions are designed to improve the future profitability and competitiveness of each segment. the company estimates that additional restructuring expense of approximately $4 million will be incurred related to the drivetrain segment. also included in the restructuring amount above is $12.5 million related to a global realignment plan intended to enhance treasury management flexibility by creating a legal entity structure that better aligns with the company's business strategy.
•   the company incurred a non-cash settlement loss of $25.7 million related to a lump-sum pension de-risking disbursement made to an insurance company to unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee all future payments to certain participants that were receiving payments from the u.s. pension plan.
•   the company recorded $21.8 million for merger and acquisition expenses primarily related to the remy acquisition. this amount includes $13.0 million related to investment banker fees and $8.8 million related to professional fees.
•   the company recorded a $10.8 million gain on the previously held equity interest in beru diesel start systems pvt. ltd. ("beru diesel") as a result of acquiring the remaining 51% of this joint venture.
•   the company recorded tax benefits of $9.9 million, $9.0 million, $3.8 million and $3.7 million primarily related to foreign tax incentives and tax settlements, the pension settlement loss, merger and acquisition expense and restructuring expense, respectively.

cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 78.8%, 78.9% and 79.1% in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company's material cost of sales was 50% to 55% of net sales in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. the company's remaining cost to convert raw material to finished product, which includes direct labor and manufacturing overhead, had continued to improve during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 compared to 2013. gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 21.2%, 21.1% and 20.9% in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") was $662.0 million, $698.9 million and $639.7 million or 8.3%, 8.4% and 8.6% of net sales for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
research and development ("r&d") costs, net of customer reimbursements, was $307.4 million, or 3.8% of net sales, in the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $336.2 million, or 4.0% of net sales, and $303.2 million, or 4.1% of net sales, in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we will continue to invest in a number of cross-business r&d programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of which are necessary for short- and long-term growth. our current long-term expectation for r&d spending is approximately 4% of net sales.
other expense, net was $101.4 million, $93.8 million and $62.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. this line item is primarily comprised of transactions discussed within the subtitle "non-comparable items impacting the company's earnings per diluted share and net earnings" above.
equity in affiliates' earnings, net of tax was $40.0 million, $47.3 million and $43.5 million in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. this line item is driven by the results of our 50%-owned japanese joint venture, nsk-warner, and our 32.6%-owned indian joint venture, turbo energy private limited ("tel"). the decrease in the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013 is primarily driven by lower earnings from nsk as a result of lower sales in china. refer to note 5, "balance

sheet information," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion of nsk-warner.
interest expense and finance charges were $60.4 million, $36.4 million and $34.2 million in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to the company's march and november 2015 issuances of senior notes.

results by reporting segment the company's business is comprised of two reporting segments: engine and drivetrain. these segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.
the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ("roic") of its business initiatives. roic is comprised of adjusted ebit after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. adjusted ebit is comprised of earnings
31
before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest ("ebit") adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss.
adjusted ebit is the measure of segment income or loss used by the company. the company believes adjusted ebit is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments.
the following tables show segment information and adjusted ebit for the company's reporting segments.

outlook our overall outlook for 2016 is cautious. the company expects weak global production growth, but moderate net new business-related sales growth in 2016 due to rapid adoption of borgwarner products around the world, partially offset by a stronger u.s. dollar, which would reduce the u.s. dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales.
the company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. the trends that are driving our long-term growth are expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of automated transmissions in europe and asia-pacific, and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in europe and asia-pacific.
liquidity and capital resources the company maintains various liquidity sources including cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of our multi-currency revolving credit agreement. at december 31, 2015, the company had $577.7 million of cash, of which $441.3 million of cash was held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states. cash held by these subsidiaries is used to fund foreign operational activities and future investments, including acquisitions. the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation, however, doing so could result in increased foreign and u.s. federal, state and local income taxes. a deferred tax liability has been recorded for the portion of these funds anticipated to be repatriated to the united states. the company uses its u.s. liquidity primarily for various corporate purposes, including but not limited to, debt service, share repurchases, dividend distributions and other corporate expenses.

balance sheet debt increased by $1,226.1 million and cash decreased by $220.1 million compared with december 31, 2014. the $1,446.2 million increase in balance sheet debt (net of cash) was primarily due to the $1 billion issuance of senior notes in march 2015, the €500 million issuance of senior notes in november 2015, the 2015 acquisitions of remy and beru diesel, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities.
total equity decreased by $59.4 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 as follows:

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $867.9 million, $801.8 million and $718.8 million in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily reflects improved working capital, partially offset by lower net earnings adjusted for non-cash charges to operations. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily reflects higher net earnings adjusted for non-cash charges to operations.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $1,759.1 million, $665.1 million and $384.8 million in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in the year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014 is primarily driven by the 2015 acquisitions of remy and beru diesel and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by the 2014 acquisition of wahler and a gain on the settlement of net investment hedges in 2015. the increase in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013 is primarily driven by the acquisition of wahler and higher capital expenditures including tooling outlays. year over year capital spending increases of $14.3 million and $145.2 million during the years ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively, were primarily due to higher spending levels required to meet increased program launches worldwide.
35
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $736.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by the $1 billion issuance of senior notes in march 2015 and the €500 million issuance of senior notes in november 2015, partially offset by the decrease in notes payable, treasury stock purchases and dividend payments. net cash used in financing activities was $201.7 million and $135.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the $66.3 million increase in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013 is primarily driven by lower net borrowings in 2014 and higher dividends paid to borgwarner stockholders, partially offset by higher payments for the purchase of treasury stock in 2013.

we believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. we will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation.
off balance sheet arrangements the company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases. types of operating leases include leases on facilities, an airplane, vehicles and certain office equipment. the total expected future cash outlays for non-cancelable operating lease obligations at december 31, 2015 is $76.6 million. refer to note 16, "leases and commitments," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information on operating leases, including future minimum payments.
36
pension and other postretirement employee benefits the company's policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. at december 31, 2015, all legal funding requirements had been met. the company contributed $19.3 million, $53.4 million and $150.4 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company expects to contribute a total of $15 million to $25 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2016. of the $15 million to $25 million in projected 2016 contributions, $8.5 million are contractually obligated, while any remaining payments would be discretionary.
the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $178.3 million and $172.8 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. of these amounts, $64.3 million and $76.5 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were related to plans in germany, where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due. in december 2014 and 2013, the company made discretionary contributions of $30.2 million and $137.5 million, respectively to its german pension plans.
other postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the company's u.s. operations. the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of $145.3 million and $169.7 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.
refer to note 11, "retirement benefit plans," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.
other matters contingencies in the normal course of business, the company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. the company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. the company's management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter.
litigation in january 2006, borgwarner diversified transmission products inc. ("dtp"), a subsidiary of the company, filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court, southern district of indiana (indianapolis division) against the united automobile, aerospace, and agricultural implements workers of america ("uaw") local no. 287 and gerald poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. dtp sought the court's affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor-management relations act or the employee retirement income security act (erisa) by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1, 2006 and october 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then-current collective bargaining agreements. on september 10, 2008, the court found that dtp's reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained
37
health insurance agreement with the uaw, which did not expire until april 24, 2009. thus, the amendments were untimely. in 2008, the company recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result of the court's decision.
dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court, southern district of indiana (indianapolis division) against the uaw local no. 287 and jim barrett and others, individually and as representatives of a defendant class, on february 26, 2009 again seeking the court's affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor - management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april 24, 2009. certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in the united states district court, eastern district of michigan (southern division) on march 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. during the last quarter of 2009, the action pending in indiana was dismissed, while the action in michigan is continuing. the company is vigorously defending against the suit.  this contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on the information available to date, the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.
environmental the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ("prps") at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("superfund") and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at 26 such sites. responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula.
the company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.
based on information available to the company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among prps; the probability that other prps, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from prps and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; and remediation alternatives), the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of $5.4 million and $6.2 million at december 31, 2015 and at december 31, 2014, respectively. the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years.
in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation ("kuhlman electric"), the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the company, relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that pre-date the company's 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric. the company previously settled or obtained dismissals of various lawsuits that were filed against kuhlman electric and others, including the company, on behalf of plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its crystal springs, mississippi plant. the company filed a lawsuit against kuhlman electric and a related entity challenging the validity of the indemnity and the defendants filed counterclaims (the "indemnity action") and a related lawsuit. on september 28, 2015, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement that, among other things, released and terminated all of borgwarner's indemnity obligations. pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties voluntarily dismissed the indemnity action on september 29, 2015 and the related lawsuit was dismissed on october 13, 2015. the company continues to pursue insurance coverage actions for reimbursement of amounts it spent under the indemnity. the company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings.
38
product liability like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the u.s., the company (or parties the company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. we believe that the company's involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. the nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, the company had approximately 10,100 and 13,300 pending asbestos-related product liability claims, respectively. the decrease in the pending claims is primarily a result of the company's continued efforts to obtain dismissal of dormant claims.
the company's policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment. the nature of the historical product being encapsulated and the lifecycle of the product allow the company to aggressively defend against these lawsuits. the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers. in the full year of 2015, of the approximately 5,300 claims resolved, 349 (7%) resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company. in the full year of 2014, of the approximately 6,500 claims resolved, 397 (6%) resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company.
prior to june 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the company's primary layer insurance carriers under a series of interim funding arrangements. in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the company has excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos-related product claims. in june 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits.
a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county, illinois by continental casualty company and related companies against the company and certain of its historical general liability insurers. the court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing. the company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers, resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the company. this includes a settlement with a carrier that occurred in the third quarter of 2015. the company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers.
in august 2013, the los angeles superior court entered a jury verdict against the company in an asbestos-related personal injury action with damages of $35.0 million, of which $32.5 million were punitive and would not be recoverable through insurance. in july 2015, the court of appeal for the state of california issued a decision striking the $32.5 million in punitive damages. the plaintiffs sought to reinstate the punitive damages by petitioning for review from the california supreme court. in october 2015, the california supreme court denied plaintiffs' petition for review. in december 2015, the company satisfied the amended judgment in full, with respect to compensatory damages only, and received the acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment from the los angeles superior court. this decision did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
to date, the company has paid and accrued $391.7 million in defense and indemnity costs in advance of insurers' reimbursement and has received $228.4 million in cash and notes from insurers. the net balance of $163.3 million is expected to be fully recovered. timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements. at december 31, 2014, insurers owed $141.9 million in association with these claims.
39
in addition to the $163.3 million net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs, the company has estimated a liability of $108.5 million for claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at december 31, 2015. the company also has a related asset of $108.5 million to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers, which is expected to be fully recovered. receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above, which is expected to occur subsequent to december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2014, the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was $111.8 million.
the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows:
december 31,
(millions of dollars)                            2015                2014
assets:
other non-current assets                   $108.5              $111.8
total insurance assets                     $108.5              $111.8
liabilities:
accounts payable and accrued expenses       $47.7               $47.4
other non-current liabilities                60.8                64.4
total accrued liabilities                  $108.5              $111.8
the company believes that its ultimate liability (i.e., the total of its indemnity or other claim dispositions plus legal related fees) cannot be reasonably estimated at this time in excess of amounts accrued. the company's ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by, among other factors, the volatility of asbestos-related litigation in the united states, the significant number of co-defendants that have filed for bankruptcy, the magnitude and timing of co-defendant bankruptcy trust payments, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns against the company, and the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels. the company's ability to reasonably estimate its liability for asbestos-related claims may also be affected in the future by the new discovery of facts; changes in litigation; the impact of any possible tort reform; changes in assumptions regarding the number and nature of asbestos-related claims, including the total population claiming exposure; the amounts of any judgments over time; and changes in settlement/defense strategies. the company reviews factors relevant to asbestos-related claims that have been, or may in the future, be asserted against it on an ongoing basis.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"). in preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. our most critical accounting policies are discussed below.
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes, as well as, the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
40
concentration of risk the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers and customers and, with the exception of certain financing transactions, does not require collateral from its oem customers. some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity. these factors have increased pressure on the industry's supply base, as suppliers cope with changing commodity costs, lower production volumes and other challenges. the company receives certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. the inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could affect future operating results.
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product. although the company may enter into long-term supply agreements with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements.
cost of sales the company includes materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales. manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials, indirect labor, factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale.
impairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 360. in assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event. if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations. long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year, the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units. this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macro economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. using this qualitative assessment, the company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. if it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition or divestiture activity, the company performs a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis. in addition, the company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
during the fourth quarter of 2015 and prior to the remy acquisition, the company performed a qualitative analysis on each reporting unit, except for reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities,
41
and determined it was more-likely-than-not the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units. for the reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities, the company performed a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis, which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. the basis of these goodwill impairment analyses is the company's annual budget and long-range plan ("lrp"). the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance. because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. further, the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the company's facts and circumstances.
the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable. different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. the primary assumptions affecting the company's december 31, 2015 goodwill quantitative, "step one," impairment reviews are as follows:
•   discount rate: the company used a 10% weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") as the discount rate for future cash flows. the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.
•   operating income margin: the company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated.
in addition to the above primary assumptions, the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models:
•   the automotive industry is cyclical and the company's results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns.
•   the company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.
•   the company is subject to risks related to international operations.
based on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2015 indicated the company's goodwill assigned to these reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired and contained fair values substantially higher than the reporting units' carrying values. additionally, sensitivity analyses were completed indicating a one percent increase in the discount rate or a one percent decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying values exceeding the fair values of the reporting units quantitatively assessed.
refer to note 6, "goodwill and other intangibles," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill.

product warranties the company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. the warranty terms are typically from one to three years. provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. these estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. our warranty provision over the last three years, and as a percentage of net sales, has stabilized based on the company's improved quality efforts and has trended as follows:
year ended december 31,
(millions of dollars)                                         2015                    2014                    2013
net sales                                            $8,023.2                $8,305.1                $7,436.6
warranty provision                                      $28.6                   $47.8                   $43.1

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change (as a percentage of net sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the company's accrued warranty liability:
december 31,
(millions of dollars)   2015            2014                2013
25 basis point decrease (income)/expense   $(20.1      )       $(20.8      )       $(18.6      )
25 basis point increase (income)/expense   $20.1               $20.8               $18.6
at december 31, 2015, the total accrued warranty liability was $107.9 million. the accrual is represented as $70.6 million in current liabilities and $37.3 million in non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
refer to note 7, "product warranty," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties.
other loss accruals and valuation allowances the company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers' compensation claims, litigation and recoverability of assets. establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.
environmental contingencies the company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites. the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability. we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range. management's estimate of the loss for environmental liability was $5.4 million at december 31, 2015.
refer to note 14, "contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding environmental accrual.
pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents.
43
the company's defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715. the determination of the company's obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 11, "retirement benefit plans," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap.
in accordance with gaap, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. the primary assumptions affecting the company's accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31, 2015 are as follows:
•   expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: the expected long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. the required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long-term returns. the expected long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the company's trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. the company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets. in determining its pension expense for the year ended december 31, 2015, the company used long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 1.75% to 6.75% outside of the u.s. and 6.71% in the u.s.
actual returns on u.s. pension assets were 0.1%, 10.3% and 8.3% for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.75% for the same years ended.
actual returns on u.k. pension assets were 1.0%, 16.5% and 12.8% for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.75% for the same years ended.
actual return on german pension assets was 5.1% and 14.5% for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.6% for the same years ended.
•   discount rate: at december 31, 2015, the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits for plans that utilize a yield curve approach. this change compared to the previous method will result in different service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) in future periods. historically, the company estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. the company elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. the company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the spot yield curve rates. the change in the service and interest costs going forward is not expected to be significant. the company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate.
the discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations ("opeb"). the company used discount rates ranging from 0.50% to 8.75% to determine its pension and other
44
benefit obligations as of december 31, 2015, including weighted average discount rates of 4.15% in the u.s., 2.99% outside of the u.s., and 3.84% for u.s. other postretirement health care plans. the u.s. discount rate reflects the fact that our u.s. pension plan has been closed for new participants since 1989 (1999 for our u.s. health care plan).
•   health care cost trend: for postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the company reviews external data and company specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. in determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of december 31, 2015, the company used health care cost trend rates of 7.14%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5% by the year 2022.
while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company's pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans on its 2016 pre-tax pension expense:

one percentage point increase in discount rate               $-                                                          *   $9.6
one percentage point decrease in expected return on assets   $(2.2                                   )                       $(3.9                                     )
one percentage point increase in expected return on assets   $2.2                                                            $3.9
________________
* a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company's u.s. 2016 pre-tax pension expense.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company's u.s. opeb interest expense:
(millions of dollars)                            impact on 2016 pre-tax opeb interest (expense)/income one percentage point decrease in discount rate   $(1.0                                   )
one percentage point increase in discount rate   $1.0
the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company's total 2016 u.s. opeb expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the company's opeb obligation and service and interest cost:

income taxes  the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
45
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
management judgment is required in determining the company's provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company's net deferred tax assets. in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the company's valuation allowance may be necessary.
the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. at the federal and state level and numerous non-u.s. jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic 605. the company's u.s. federal and certain state income tax returns and certain non-u.s. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. at december 31, 2015, the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more-likely-than-not loss on certain of its tax positions, which is included in other non-current liabilities. nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.

new accounting pronouncements in november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17, "income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes." under this guidance, deferred tax liabilities and assets are required to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. prior to this guidance, the deferred taxes for each jurisdiction (or tax-paying component of a jurisdiction) would be presented as a net current asset or liability and net non-current asset or liability. this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016 with earlier application permitted. the company adopted this guidance prospectively as of december 31, 2015 and accordingly, prior period amounts have not been revised.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-16, "simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments." under this guidance, an acquirer is required to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-15, "presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements."  under this guidance, debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements would be deferred as an asset and amortized ratably over the term, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-11, "simplifying the measurement of inventory."  under this guidance, inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using lifo or the retail inventory method. this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016.  the company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
in may 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-07, "disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent)."  under this guidance, investments measured at net asset value, as a practical expedient for fair value, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company's consolidated financial statements, but will impact pension asset disclosures.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-03, "simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs," which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. under this guidance such costs would be presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the company's adoption of this guidance as of december 31, 2015 would result in the reduction of assets and liabilities by approximately $16 million.
in may 2014, the fasb amended the accounting standards codification to add topic 606, "revenue from contracts with customers," outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and superseding most current revenue recognition guidance. this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
47
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks.
we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. for quantitative disclosures about market risk, refer to note 10, "financial instruments," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs. the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). at december 31, 2015, the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 81.1% of total debt, including the impact of the interest rate swaps. our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates. a 10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre-tax interest expense of approximately $2.1 million, $0.2 million and $1.7 million in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. currently, our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound, the chinese yuan, the euro, the hungarian forint, the japanese yen, the mexican peso, the swedish krona and the south korean won. we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans. such non-u.s. dollar debt was $144.6 million and $129.6 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. in addition, the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. as a result of the remy acquisition, the company acquired foreign exchange forward contracts with market values reflecting a cumulative loss of $7.5 million. these contracts were assumed by the company at fair market value and designated as hedges of future cash flows. as of december 31, 2015, the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, all of which mature in less than one year.
the foreign currency translation adjustment losses of $260.5 million and $341.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the foreign currency translation adjustment income of $40.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 contained within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income represent the foreign currency translational impacts of converting our non-u.s. dollar subsidiaries financial statements to the company's reporting currency (u.s. dollar). the 2015 foreign
48
currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening u.s. dollar, which increased approximately 10% in relation to the euro between december 31, 2014 and 2015. this 10% change in the euro increased other comprehensive loss by approximately $220 million. the 2014 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening u.s. dollar, which increased approximately 12% in relation to the euro between december 31, 2013 and 2014. this 12% change in the euro increased other comprehensive loss by approximately $243 million. the 2013 foreign currency translation adjustment income was primarily due to the impact of a weakening u.s. dollar in relation to the euro.
commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products. commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. as a result of the remy acquisition, the company acquired commodity derivative contracts with market values reflecting a cumulative loss of $9.2 million. these contracts were assumed by the company at fair market value and have been designated as hedges of future cash flows. as of december 31, 2015, the company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of $38.8 million. as of december 31, 2015, the company was holding commodity derivatives with a negative fair market value of $2.1 million, of which $2.0 million mature in less than one year.
disclosure regarding forward-looking statements the matters discussed in this item 7 include forward looking statements. see "forward looking statements" at the beginning of this annual report on form 10-k.
